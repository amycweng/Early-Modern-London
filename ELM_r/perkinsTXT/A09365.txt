in that part of the prophecie which goes before the holy ghost setteth downe and foretelleth the calling of the gentiles which was to beginne at the death of christ and from thence to continue vnto this day and so consequently to the ende of the world in the former verses of this chapter there is mention made of the reiection of the iewes i meane not a generall but a particular rejection namely then when they were in affliction in the daies of isaiah now in this and so in all other prophecies of the like kind which intreat of this point christ himselfe is brought in speaking in his owne person and the words of this chapter from the beginning to this present verse and the rest that follow are the words of christ the mediatour in the verses going before he disputes the case of their rejection and and the summe of the whole disputation is that either he or they themselues were the causes thereof but he was not the cause amp therfore they themselues by their sinnes the reason whereby he prooues that they themselues were the cause is framed in this sort you iewes canot bring any writing or bill of diuorce to shew that i rejected you therfore i appeale euen to your owne consciences whether you haue not brought this iudgement vpon your selues by your iniquities verse on the other side the reaso why god was not the cause is because he for his part called them in great mercie and ioue but when he called they would not obey ver now in the ende of the second verse is contained an answer to a secret reply that some obstinate iewe might make after this manner god hath not nowe the like power in sauing and deliuering vs as he hath had in form r times therefore we cannot hope or expect any deliuerance from him and howe then shall we doe in the meane while to this the lord himselfe makes answer ver that his hand is not shortned nor his power lessened in regard of greater workes much lesse in respect of their deliuerance and though the present affliction which they indured was great and tedious yet they were not to be ouermuch dismayed in themselues but rather to be comforted because god had giuen him the tongue of the learned to minister a word in season to the wearie and distressed and consequently that he had power to case and refresh that their wearines and affliction in this text then there is set downe one principal dutie of christs propheticall office by allusion to the practises of the prophets in the old testament especially those which belonged to the schooles of elijah and elizeus who are here tearmed the learned and out of the words thereof one speciall point of instruction may be gathered namely that there is a certaine knowledge or doctrine reuealed in the word of god whereby the consciences of the weake may be rectified and pacified i gather it thus it was one speciall dutie of christs propheticall office to giue comfort to the consciences of those that were distressed as the prophet here recordeth now as christ had this power to execute and performe such a dutie so he hath committed the dispensation therof to the ministers of the gospel for we may not thinke that christ in his owne person ministred and spake words of comfort to the wearie in the times of the prophets because he was not then exhibited in our nature and yet he did then speake but how in the persons of the prophets so likewise because christ now in the new testament speaks not vnto the afflicted in his owne proper person it remaineth therfore that he performes this great worke in the ministerie of pastours and teachers vpon earth to whom he hath giuen knowledge and other gifts to this ende and purpose there must needes therefore be a certen and infallible doctrine propounded and taught in the scriptures whereby the consciences of man distressed may be quieted and releeued and this doctrine is not attained vnto by extraordinarie reuelation but must be drawne out of the written word of god the point therfore to be handled is what this doctrine should be it is not a matter easie and at hand but full of labour and difficultie yes very large like vnto the maine sea i will onely as it were walke by the banks of it and propound the heads of doctrine that thereby i may at least occasion others to consider amp handle the same more at large that i may proceede in order first i am to lay downe certaine grounds or preambles which may giue light and direction to the things that follow and in the next place i will propound and answer the maine and principall questions of conscience of the two first grounds of cases confession and the degrees of goodnes the grounds or preambles are especially foure the first touching confession the second touching the degrees of goodnesse in things and actions the third touching the degrees of sinne the fourth and last concerning the subiection and power of conscience of these in order the first ground is that in the troubles of conscience it is meete and conuenient there should alwaies be vsed a priuate confession for iames saith confesse your faults one to another and pray one for another thereby signifying that confession in this case is to be vsed as a thing most requisite for in all reason the physitian must first know the disease before he can applie the remedie and the griefe of the heart will not be discerned vnlesse it be manifested by the confession of the partie diseased and for this cause also in the griefe of conscience the scruple that is the thing that troubleth the conscience must be knowne neaerthelesse in priuate confession these caueats must be obserued first it must not be vrged as a thing simply or absolutely necessarie without which there can be no saluatio againe it is not fit that confession should be of all sinnes but onely of the scruple it selfe that is of that or those sinnes alone which do trouble and molest the conscience thirdly though confession may be made to any kind of m n confesse one to another saith iames yet is it especially to be made to the prophets and ministers of the gospell for they in likelyhood of all other man in respect of their places and gifts are the fittest and best able to instruct correct cofort amp en orme the weake amp wounded coscience lastly the person to whome it is made must be a man of trust amp fidelity able amp willing to keepe secret things that are reueiled yes to burie the as it were in the graue of obliuion for loue couereth a multitudeof sinnes the next ground is touching the degrees of goodnes in humane things and actions goodnesse in things is twofold vncreated and created vncreated is god himselfe who neuer had beginning and who is goodnesse it selfe because his nature is absolutely and perfectly good and because he is the author and worker thereof in all things created created goodnes is that whereby the creature is made good and it is nothing els but the fruit of that goodnesse that is essentially in god now the degrees thereof are these there is a generall or naturall goodnesse in creatures amp a more speciall or morall goodnesse generall goodnesse is that whereby all creatures are accepted and approoued of god by whome they were both created amp ordained thus euery creature is good partly by creation and partly by ordination by creation it is that the substance of each creature as of the sun the moone the earth water meate drink ampc is good hauing the beeing thereof from god hence also the essentiall properties quantities qualities motions actions and inclinations of the creatures in themselues considered with all their euents are good by the same generall goodnesse also euen the deuill himselfe and his actions as he is a substance and as they are actions hauing their beeing from god are good things againe doe take vnto them the condition of goodnesse not onely by creation but also by god ordination whereby they are directed and appointed to some certen vses amp endes thus the euill conscience hel amp deathare good because they are ordained of god for the execution of his iustice howsoeuer in themselues amp to vs they be euill besides this generall and naturall goodnesse there is also a speciall or morall goodnes properly so called and it is that which is agreeable to the eternall and vnchangeable wisdome of god reuealed in the morall law wherin it is commanded and things as they are therein commanded to be done by god are good morally now of actions morally good there be two degrees for they are either good in themselues alone or good both in themselues and in the doer in themselues alone some things be morally good for example when a wicked man giues an almes it is a good worke onely in it selfe but not good in the doer because it is not done in faith and from a good conscience and so are all the vertues of the heathen morally good in themselues but they are not good in heathen man for in them they are but splendida peccata beautifull sinnes the next degree of goodnesse is whereby things and actions are both good in themselues and in the doer also of this sort were the praiers and almes of cornelius good in themselues and in him also because he was a beleeuer now opposite to things and actions morally good or euill are actions and things of a middle nature commonly tearmed indifferent which in themselues being neither good nor euill may be done or not done without sinne in themselues i say for in their circumstances they are and may be made either euill or good and here we must remember to put a difference betweene conueniencie and inconuenience which ariseth from the nature of indifferent things conueniencie is when a thing or action is so fitted to the circumstances and the circumstances fitted to it that thereby it becomes a thing conuenient on the other side inconuenience is when the thing or action is done in vnmeete circumstances which bring some hurt or losse to the outward man or stand not with decencie and therefore doe make it to be inconuenient and by this that hath been said we may discerne when an action is good euill indifferent conuenient or inconuenient of the nature and differences of sinne the third ground is touching the degrees or differences of sinne and here we must first of all search what is sinne properly and what is properly a sinner sinne in his proper nature as saint john saith is an anomie that is a want of conformitie to the lawe of god for the better vnderstanding whereof we must know that there were in adam before his fall three things not to be seuered one from the other the substance of his bodie and soule the faculties and powers of his bodie and soule and the image of god consisting in a straightnes and conformitie of all the affections and powers of man to god will now when adam falls and sinnes against god what is his sinne not the want of the two former for they both remained but the very want and absence of the third thing namely of conformitie to god will i make it plaine by this resemblance in a musicall instrument there is to be considered not only the instrument it selfe and the sound of the instrumet but also the harmony in the sound nowe the contrarie to harmonie or the disorder in musicke is none of the two former but the third namely the discord which is the want or absence of harmonie which we call disharmonie in the same manner the sinne of adam is not the absence either of the substance or of the faculties of the soule and the bodie but the want of the third thing before named amp that is conformitie or correspondencie to the will of god in regard of obedience but some may say the want of conformitie in the powers of the soule is not sinne properly because in sinne there must bee not onely an absence of goodnesse but be some twentie or thirtie yeares yet the partie offending doth not therefore cease to be a sinner now then i demaund what is the very thing for which he is named and tearmed still a sinner in the time present the offence beeing past the answer is that euery actuall sinne beside the three former must be considered with a fourth thing to wit a certaine staine or blotte which it imprints and leaues in the offender as a fruit and that is an inclination or euill disposition of the heart wherby it becomes more apt amp prone to the offence done or to any other sinne for looke as the dropsie man the more he drink the drier he is and the more he still desires to drinke euen so a sinner the more he sinnes the apter is he to sinne and more desirous to keepe still a course in wickednes and as a man that lookes vpon the sun if he turne his face away remains turned vntill he turne himselfe againe so he that turnes from god by any sinne makes himselfe a sinner and so remaines vntill he turne himselfe againe by repentance thus dauid was a sinner not onely in the very act of his adulterie amp mur ther but euen when the act was done past he remained still a murtherer and dulterer because a new or rather a re pronenesse to these and all oth tooke place in his heart by his fal strength till he turned to god by vpon the admonition of the pro thing then whereby a sinner is tearmed a sinner is the fault together with the fruit thereof namely the blot imprinted in the soule so oft as man doe actually offend the vse of this doctrine touching sinne is twofold first by it we learne and see what is originall sinne wherby an infant in the first conception and birth is indeed a sinner euery infant must be considered as a part of adam proceeding of him and partaking of his nature and therby it is made a sinner not onely by imputation of adams offence but also by propagation of an apt esse and pronenes vnto euery euill receiued together with nature from adam and thus ought we to conceiue originall sinne not to be the corruption of nature alone but adams first offence imputed with the fruit thereof the corruption of nature which is an inclination vnto euery euill deriued together with nature from our first parents secondly by this we are taught to take heed of all and euery sinne whether it be in thought word or deed because the committing therof though in respect of the act it passeth a in the doing yet it breedeth and in seth a wicked disposition in the heart h beene said to the offence done or a sinne man deceiue themselues that the euill of sinne to be only in the ng amp to goe no further wheras in offence hath a certen blot going with it that corrupteth the heart and causeth man to delight and lie in his offence which lying in sinne is a greater cause of damnatio then the very sin it selfe this therfore must admonish vs to take heed least we continue in any sinne and if it fall out that through infirmitie we be ouertaken by any tentation we must labour to rise again and turne from our sinne to god by new and speedy repentance thus much of sinne it selfe now follow the differences thereof which are manifold the first sort are to be gathered from the causes and beginnings of sinne in man which are threefold reason will and affection the differeces of sinne in respect of reason are these first some are sinnes of knowledge some of ignorance a sinne of knowledge is when a man offends against his knowledge doing euill when he knoweth it to be euill and this is greater then a sinne of ignorance for he that knoweth his masters will and doth it not shall be beaten with many stripes a sinne of ignorance is when a man doth euill not knowing it to be euill thus paul was a blasphemer an oppressour and persecuted the church of christ ignorantly and in a blinde zeale not knowing that which hee did to be euill nowe by ignorance here i meane an ignorance of those things which ought to be knowne and this is twofold simple or affected simple ignorance is when a man after diligence and good paines taking still remaines ignorant this ignorance will not excuse any man if it be of such things as he is bound to know for it is said he that doth not his masters will by reason he knew it not shall be beaten with stripes though fewer and in this regard euen the heathen which knew not god are inexcusable because they were bound to haue known him for adam had the perfect knowledge of god imprinted in his nature and lost the same through his owne default for himselfe and his posteritie and it is the commandement of god whereunto euery man is boud to performe obedience that man should know him that is his will and word but some may say then how can any man be saued seeing euery man is ignorat of many things which he ought to know an if we know the grouds of religion amp be careful to obey god according to our knowledge hauing withall a care and desire to increase in the knowledge of god and his will god will hold vs excused for our desire and indeauour to obey is accepted for obedience it selfe and the greater this simple ignorace is the less is the sinne for hereupon it was that peter lessened and in some sort excused the sinne of the iewes in crucifying christ because they did it through ignorance and so doth paul his sinne in persecuting the church when he alleadgeth that it was done ignorantly in vnbeleefe but howsoeuer this sinne by such meanes may be lessened yet remaines it still a sinne worthie condemnation affected ignorance is when a man takes delight in his ignorance and will of purpose be ignorant not vsing but contemning the meanes wherby to get and increase knowledge and that carelessely and negligently because he will not leaue sinne which he loueth nor forsake the euill trade of life wherin he delighteth this is the sinne of those whereof iob speaketh who say vnto god depart from vs for we desire not the knowledge of thy waies and of whome dauid complaineth that they flat themselues in their owne eyes and haue left off to vnderstand and to doe good this ignorance is damnable and deuilish it excuseth no man but doth rather aggrauate and increase his sinne yes it is the mother of many grieuous enormities againe ignorance is twofold of the ignorant law or of the thing the law requireth ignorance of the law is when a man knowes not the law of god writte nor the law of nature this ignorance may somewhat lessen the sinne but it excuseth no man because it is naturall and euery man is bound to know the law ignorance of the thing the law requireth is the ignorance of the ignorantia facti fact and that is either with the fault of the doer or without the fault faultie ignorace is the ignorance of a fact which he might haue preueted as whe a ma in his drunkenes killeth another in this fact not knowing what de doth he also knoweth not that he hath offended amp yet because he might haue preuented his drunkennes therfore he is faultie and sinneth faultlesse ignorance is when a fact is done which could not be either knowne or auoided before hand for example if a man be opping a tree and his axe head fall from the helve out of his hand and kills another passing by here is indeede manslaughter but no voluntarie murther because it was a thing that could not be auoided and did not fall out through his default and this ignorance is excusable the second fountaine of sinne is the will from whence arise these three differences of sinnes some are from the will immediately some besides the will and some are mixt partly with the will and partly against the will sinnes proceeding from the will are properly tearmed voluntarie such as the doer mooued by his own wil commits though he know them to be euill and here the more free the wil is the greater is the sinne for wil added to knowledge makes the sinne the greater vnder voluntarie sinnes are comprehended all such as proceede from stirred affections as when a man tells a lie for feare or striketh another in anger and the reason is because these offences though they are not done vpon deliberation but arise from the violence of affection yet they doe not exclude consent hither also we may referre sinnes committed by compulsion as when a man is forced to denie his religion his offence in deede and in truth is voluntarie though some otherwise think it to be a mixt action for compulsion doth not reach to the will but to the outward man and serues to draw forth a consent and and when consent is yeelded he denies his religion voluntarily for the will cannot be constrained in the next place sinnes beside the will are such as are neither directly from the wil nor against it of this sort are the first sudden motions vnto sinne conceiued in the heart with some inward pleasure and delight and these are truly sinnes though in respect little sinnes condemned in the last commandement and they are not from the will because they goe without and before consent neither yet are they against the will because then the heart would not take delight in them here by the way we are to note against the doctrine of the papists that all sinnes are not voluntarie for whatsoeuer wanteth conformitie to the law of god is sinne whether it be with consent of will or no but many such desires and delights arise suddenly in the heart of man which are not according to the law of god and haue no consent or approbation of will in like manner whe one man kils another thinking that he killeth a wild beast if the same man remembreth afterwards what he hath done and is not grieued for the fact in this case he hath sinned because his not grieuing is offensiue vnto god though the fact were meerely besides his will mixt sinnes are partly from the will partly against it of this sort are the workes of the man regenerate which are done partly with his will and partly against his will beeing partly good and partly euill the reason hereof is this there are in man after regeneration two contrarie grounds or beginnings of actions to wit naturall corruption or the inclination of the minde wil and affections to that which is against the law called the flesh and a created qualitie of holines wrought in the said faculties by the holy ghost tearmed the spirit and these two are not seuered but ioyned and mingled together in all the faculties and powers of the soule now betweene these there is a continuall combate corruption fighting against grace amp grace against corruptio hence it is that there beeing euen in one amp the same wil trarie inclinatios there must necessarily flow from the man regenerate contrary actions the flesh in euery action willing that which is euill and the spirit on the otherside that which is good this paul confessed and acknowledged vpon his owne experience after his conuersion when he said to will is present with me but i find no meanes perfectly to do that which is good again i delight in the law of god concerning the inner man but i see an other law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde and leading me captiue to the law of sinne which is in my members the third ground or fountaine of sinne in man is affection from whence doe proceede two kinds namely sinnes of infirmitie and sinnes of presumption sinnes of infirmitie are such as proceede from the sudden passions of the minde and the strong affectios of the heart as from hatred griefe anger sorrow amp such like these sinnes are commonly thought to be in all man but the truth is they are properly incident to the regenerate for infirmitie cannot be said properly to be in them in whome sin hath firmitie or strength and where there is no power of grace at all againe the man that is regenerate sinneth not neither when he would because he is restrained by the grace of god that is in him nor in what manner he would partly because he sinneth not with al his heart the strength of his flesh beeing abated by the spirit and partly for that beeing fallen he lies not still but recouers himselfe by speedy repentance an euident argument that the sinnes whereinto he falleth are not presumptuous but are ordinarily of weaknes and infirmitie sinnes of prsumptio are such as proceed from pride arrogancy wilfulnes and hautines of mans heart against these dauid praieth saying let not presumptuous sinnes haue dominion ouer me and of them there be three degrees the first is when a man wilfully goeth on in his sinnes vpon an erronious perswasion of god mercie and of his owne future repentance this is the sinne of most man the second is when a man sinneth wilfully in contempt of the law of god this is called by moses a sinne with a high hand amp the punnishment thereof was by present death to be cut off from among the people the third when a man sinneth not onely wilfully and contemptuouslly but of malice amp spight against god himselfe and christ iesus and by this we may conceiue what is the sin against the holy ghost which is not euery sinne of presumption or against knowledge and conscience but such a kind of presumptuous offence in which true religion is renounced and that of set purpose and resolued malice against the very maiestie of god himselfe and christ heb now follow other differences of sinne in regard of the obiect thereof which is the law in respect of of the law sin is two fold either of commissio or of omission i say in respect of the law because god hath reuealed in his law two sorts of precepts the one wherein some good thing is commanded to be done as to loue god with all our hearts and our neighbour as our selues the other wherin some euill is forbidden to be done as the making of a grauen image the taking the name of god in vaine ampc now a sinne of comission is when a man doth any thing that is flatly forbidden in the law and word of god as when one man kills another contrarie to the law which saith thou shalt not kill a sinne of omission is when a man leaueth vnperformed some dutie which the law requireth as for example the preseruing of his neighbours life or good estate when it lieth in his power so to doe these also are truly sinnes and by them as well as by the other man shall be tried in the last iudgement sinnes of omission haue three degrees first when a man doth nothing at all but omits the dutie commanded both in whole and in part as when hauing opportunitie amp abilitie he doth not mooue so much as one finger for the sauing of his neighbours life secondly when a man performes the dutie inioyned but failes both in the manner amp measure therof thus the heathen failed in doing good workes in that the things which they did for substance and matter were good and commendable beeing done vpon ciuill and honest respects and referred to the comon good yet in truth their actions were no better then sinnes of omission in as much as they issued from corrupted fountaines hearts voide of faith and aimed not at the maine end and scope of all humane actions the honour and glorie of god thirdly when a man doth things in a right manner but faileth in the measure thereof and thus the children of god doe sinne in al the duties of the lawe for they doe the good things the law commadeth in louing god amp their neighbour but they cannot attaine to that measure of loue which the lawe requireth and thus the best man liuing doe sinne in euery good worke they doe so as if god should enter into iudgement deale with the in the rigour of his iustice amp examine them by the strict rule of the lawe he might iustly condemne them euen for their best actions and in this regard when we pray daily for the pardon of our sinnes the best workes we doe must come in the number of them because we faile if not in substance amp manner yet at the least in the measure of goodnesse that ought to bee in the doing of them we must also haue care to repent vs euen of these our sins of omission as well as of the other of commission because by leauing vndone our dutie we doe oftner offend then by sinnes committed and the least omission is enough to condemne vs if it should be exacted at our hands the next difference of sinnes may be this some are crying sinnes some are sinnes of toleration crying sinnes i call those which are so hainous amp in their kind so grieuous that they hasten god iudgements and cal downe for speedie vengeance vpon the sinner of this kind there are sundry examples in the scriptures principally foure first cains sinne in murthering his innocent brother abell whereof it was saide the voice of thy brothers blood crieth vnto me from the earth the next is the sinne of sodome and gomorrha which was pride fulnes of bread abundance of idlenesse vnmerciful dealing with the poore and all manner of vncleannesse ezech amp of this the lord said that the crie of sodome and gomorrha wa great and their sinnes exceeding grieuous the third is the sinne of oppression indured by the israelites in egypt at the hand of pharao and his task masters the fourth is mercilesse iniustice in wrongfull withholding and detaining the labourers hire now they are called crying sinnes for these causes first because they are now come to their full measure and height beyond which god will not suffer them to passe without due punishment againe the lord takes more notice and inquires further into them then into others by reason that they exceede and are most eminent where they be committed thirdly they call for present helpe to the afflicted and wronged and consequently for speedie exequution of vengeance vpon the authors and committers of them and lastly because god is wont to giue are vnto the cryes of those that endure so heauie measure at the hands of others and accordingly to helpe them and reward the other with deserued punishment next vnto these are sinnes of toleration less then the former which though in theselues they deserue death yet god in his mercie shewes his patience amp long sufferace vpon the committers thereof either deferring the temporal punishment or pardoning both temporall and eternall to his elect such a sinne was the ignorance of the gentiles before christs comming which god deferred to punish and as we say winked at it more especially there be three sorts of sinnes of toleratio the first is originall sin or concupiscence in the regenerate after regeneration and the fruits thereof for it is not quite abolished by regeneration but remaines more or lesse molesting amp tempting a man till death and yet if we carrie a constant purpose not to sinne and indeauour our selues to resist all tentations this concupiscence of ours shall not be imputed vnto vs nor we condemned for it and to this purpose the holy apostle saith there is no condemnation to them that are in christ yet saith he not there is nothing worthie condemnation in them for originall sinne remaines till death truly deseruing damnation though it be not imputed the second kind of sinnes of toleration are secret vnknowne and hidden sinnes in the regenerate for who can tell how of he offendeth saith dauid when a man that is the child of god shall examine his heart and humble himselfe euen for all his particular sinnes which he knoweth by himselfe there shall yet remaine some vnknowne sinnes of which he cannot haue a particular repentance and yet they are not imputed when there is repetance for knowne sinnes as for example dauid repents of his murther amp adulterie and yet afterwards erring in iudgement by reason of the corruption of the times he liued to his death in the sinne of polygamie without any particular repentance that we heare of in like manner did the patriarkes who may not altogether be excused yet they were not codemned therof neither were they saued without repentance for this sinne but god in mercie accepted a generall repetance for the same and the like is the case of all the elect in regard of their secret amp hidden faults for vnles god should accept of a general repentance for vnknown sinns few or none at all should be saued and herein doth the endles mercy of god notably appeare that he vouchsafeth to accept of our repetance whe we repent though not in particular as we ought to doe neuertheles this must not incorage or imbolden any man to liue in his sinnes without turning vnto god for vnlesse we repent in particular of all the sin we know not only our knowne offences but euen our secret sinnes shall codemne vs many sinnes are committed by man which afterwards in processe of time are quite forgotten others are comitted which notwithstading are not knowne whether they be sins or no and in doing the best duties we can we offend often amp yet when we offend we perceiue it not amp all these in the regenerate through the mercy of god are sinnes of toleratio in respect of particular repentance the third kind of sinnes of toleration are certaine particular facts of man not approved of in scripture and yet remitted in respect of punishment such was the fact of zipporah in circumcising her child in presence of her husband he beeing able to haue done it himselfe and shee hauing no calling to doe that which she did for though the hand of god was against him yet was he not sick as some would excuse the matter neither is there any such thing in the text but it is rather to be thought that she her selfe circumcised her son in hast to preuent her husband for the deede was done in some indignation and shee cast the foreskin at his feete and yet because this fact was some manner of obedience in that the thing was done which god required though not in the maner that he required god accepted the same amp staied his hand fro killing moses thus god accepted of ahabs humility thogh it were in hypocrisie because it was a shew of obedience and for that deferred a temporall punishmet til the daies of his posteritie god sent lyons to destroy the assyrians that dwelt in samaria for their idolatry yet so soon as they had learned to feare the lord after the maner of the god of israel though they mingled the same with their own idolatric god for that halfe obedience suffered the to dwel in peace the sixt distinction of sinnes may be this some are sinnes against god some against man this distinction is grounded vpon a place in samuel if one man sinne against another the iudge shall iudge it but if a man sinne against the lord who shall plead for him sinnes against god are such as are directly and immediately committed against the maiestie of god such are atheisme idolatry blasphemie periurie profanation of the sabboth amp all the breaches of the first table sinnes against man are iniuries hurts losses and damages whereby our neighbour is in his dignitie life chastitie wealth good name or any other way iustly offended or by vs hindred and such actions must be considered two waies first as they are iniuries and hurts done vnto our neighbour and fecondly as they are anomies or breaches of god law forbidding vs to doe them and in this second respect they are called sinnes because sinne is properly against god and therefore by sinnes against man we are to vnderstand iniuries losses or damages done vnto them in this sense must that place in matthew be expounded if thy brother sinne against thee ampc the seauenth difference of sinnes is noted by s paul where he saith euery sinne that a man doth is without the bodie but he that commits fornication sinneth against his owne bodie in which place it is implyed that some sinnes are without the bodie amp some against mans owne bodie sinnes without the bodie are such sinnes as a man committeth his bodie beeing the instrument of the sinne but not the thing abused such are murther theft amp drunkennesse for in the committing of these sinnes the bodie is but a helper and onely a remote instrumentall cause and the thing abused is without the bodie for example in drunkennes the thing abused by the drunkard is wine or strong drinke in theft another mans goods in murther the instrument whereby the fact is committed the bodie indeede conferres his helpe to these things but the iniurie is directed to the creatures of god to the bodie and goods of our neighbour and such are all sinnes adulterie onely excepted sinnes against the bodie are those in which it selfe is not onely the instrument but the thing abused also such a sinne is adulterie onely and those that are of that kind properly against the bodie first because the bodie of the sinner is both a furthering cause of the sinne and also that thing which he abuseth against his owne selfe secondly by this offence he doth not onely hinder but loose the right power and propertie of his bodie in that be makes it the member of an harlot and lastly though other sinnes in their kind doe bring a shame and dishonour vpon the bodie yet there is none that sitteth so nigh or leaueth a blot so deepely imprinted in it as doth the sinne of vncleannes the eight distinction of sinnes is grounded vpon pauls exhortation to timothie communicate not with other mens sinnes sinnes are either other mens sinnes or communicatio with other mens sins this distinction is the rather to be knowne and remembred because it serues to extenuate or aggrauate sins committed communication with sinne is done sundry waies first by counsell thus ca phas sinned when he gaue counsel to put christ to death secondly by commandement so dauid sinned in the murther of vrias thirdly by consent or assistance rom thus saul sinned in keeping the garments of them that oned steuen act amp fourthly by prouocation thus they sinne that prouok others to sinne and hereof paul speaketh when he saith fathers must not prouoke their children to wrath ephesians fiftly by negligence or silence this is the sinne of the minister when man are called to reprooue sinne and doe not sixtly by flatterie when man sooth vp others in sinne seauenthly by winking at sinnes or passing them ouer by slight reproofe ephesians thus eli sinned in rebuking his sonnes and thereby brought a temporall iudgement vpon himselfe and his familie sam chap and eightly by participation ephesians amp thus they doe sinne that are receiuers of the eues ninthely by defending another man in his sinne for he that iustifieth the wicked and condemneth the iust euen they both are an abomination to the lord the ninth distinction followeth some mens sinnes saith paul are open before hand some follow after which place by some is expounded thus some mens sinnes are kept secret till the last iudgement and some are reuealed in this life before that day this i thinke is a truth but not the meaning of the text for in the verse the apostle spake of ordination giuing charge to timothie that he should not suddenly admit any into ecclesiasticall offices least he did partake with their sinnes now in this verse e rendereth a reason thereof saying some mens sinnes are open before hand that i some mens faults and wants are knowne before their ordination to ecclesiasticall offices and of such the church may know what to iudge and say but some againe follow after that is they are not reuealed till after their ordination amp thus iudas his wickednes did not appeare at the first but was reuealed after he was called to be an apostle and thus we see what be the differences of sinnes touching all which this must be held amp remembred for a ground that euery sinne in what degree soeuer it be is mortall of it selfe and no sinne is veniall in it owne nature for the wages of euery sinne is death and cursed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the law to doe them gal this ground must be holde against the church of rome who in her case diuinitie vseth to pacifie the conscience by teaching man that sundry sinnes are veniall now though euery sinne of it selfe be mortall yet all are not equally mortall but some more some lesse for the better vnderstanding whereof it is to be remembred that in sinne there be sundrie steppes amp degrees whereby one and the same sinne may be lessened or increased and so become more or lesse hainous before god if it be asked how can this be i answer that sinne may admit aggrauation or extenuation sundrie waies first by the circumstances which are principally seauen the first is the subiect or person sinning for example the sinne of a publike person is more hainous yes more mortall then the sinne of a priuate man because he is in eminent place and his actions are more exemplarie and scandalous then the actions of inferiour man the servant that knowes his masters will if he doth it not is the greater sinner and shall endure a greater punishment then he that neglects the same vpon simple ignorance matth the minister and dispenser of the word if he be vnfaithfull and vnprofitable his offence and consequently his punishment is farre greater then other mens matth the second is the obiect or partie which is offended in this respect it was that the iewes did more hainously sinne in crucifying christ the son of god the lord of glorie then did their fathers which persequuted and killed the prophets againe the word of god teacheth that the iniurie that is don vnto those whome god tenderly loueth is farre more displeasing vnto him then if it were done to others he that toucheth you saies the prophet meaning the iewes his chosen and beloued people toucheth the apple of his eye zach the man that deuiseth mischiefe against his harmelesse brother that dwelleth peaceably by him committeth a sinne most odious vnto god and man prov psalm he that is called and conuerted vnto god and christ and maketh not honest prouision for his owne which are of his familie is so notorious an offender that s paul holds him a de ier of the faith and worse then an insidel tim the person that shall ralle vpon the iudge or speake euill of the ruler of his people is a greater transgressour of god commandement then he that reuileth or abuseth an ordinarie man exod the third is the thing done in which the offence is comitted thus to falsifie the word of god and to prophane his worship and seruice is much more abominable in his sight then is the falsifying of the word of a man or the abuse of humane lawes and ordinances thus againe the hurting and indamaging of the person and life of our neighbour is a more odious offence then is the diminishing of his goods and outward estate and the hurt that redoundeth by our default vnto his soule is more offensiue euery way then the wrong that is offered vnto his bodie the fourth is the place where it is done according to this circumstance if a man shall either speake or doe any thing that comes vnder the name of a breach of pietie or iustice in publike place as in the congregation in open court or generall assemblie and that with publike and generall scandall he is a greater offendour then if he spake or did the same at home in his house or closet the fift is the end in regard hereof he that stealeth from another that whereby he may satisfie his hunger and saue his life beeing driuen to extreame necessitie offendeth in a lower and less degree then the theefe that robbeth by the high way side for this ende to enrich himselfe by the losses of other man the sixt is the manner how thus he that committeh vncleannesse in the outward act doeth more grieuously sinne and with greater scandall then if he onely entertained an vncleane thought into his heart and he that sinneth of set purpose and presumption or of obstinate and resolued malice against god hath proceeded vnto a higher degree of iniquitie then if he had fallen vpon ignorance infirmity or disordered and distempered affection in like manner the sinne of the iewes in forcing pilate by their threatning tearmes as that he was an enemie to caesar ampc to the vniust condemnation of christ iesus was an higher degree then the sinne of pilate himselfe who yelding vnto their import nitie pronounced sentence against him ioh the last is the time which also serues to aggrauate the sinne for ordinarie disobedience in the time of grace and wilfull neglect of god calling in the aboundance of meanes is a great deale more damnable then the commission of sin in the daies of ignorance and blindnesse when the like meanes are wanting the second way to aggrauate sinne is by addition of sin to sin and that is done sundry waies first by committing one sinne in the necke of an other as dauid sinned when he added murther to adulterie secondly by doubling and multiplying of sinne that is by falling often into the same sinne thirdly by lying in sinne without repentance and here it must be remembred that man of yeares liuing in the church are not simply condemned for their particular sinnes but for their continuance and residence in them sinnes committed make man worthie of damnation but liuing and abiding in them without repentance is the thing that brings damnation for as in the militant church man are excommunicate not so much for their offence as for their obstinacie so shall it be in the church triumphant the kingdom of heauen shall be barred against man not so much for their sinne committed as for their lying therin without repentance and this is the manner of god dealing with those that haue liued within the precincts of the church they shall be condemned for the very want of true faith and repentance this should admonish euery one of vs to take heed least we lie in any sin and that being any way ouertaken we should speedily repent least we aggrauate our sinne by continuance therein and so bring vpon our selues swift damnation thirdly the same sinne is made greater or less foure waies according to the number of degrees in the committing of a sinne noted by s iames temptation conception birth and perfection actual sinne in the first degree of tentation is when the minde vpon some sudden motion is drawne away to thinke euill and withall is tickled with some delight thereof for a bad motion cast into the mind by the flesh and the deuill is like vnto the baite cast into the water that allureth and delighteth the fish and causeth it to bite sin in conception is when with the delight of the minde there goes consent of will to doe the euill thought on sinne in birth is when it comes forth into an action or execution sin in perfection is when man are growne to a custome and habit in sin vpon long practise for the often committing of one and the same sinne leaues an euill impression in the heart that is a strong or violent inclination to that or any other euill as hath bin taught before and sinne thus made perfect brings forth death for custome in sinning brings hardnes of heart hardnes of heart impenitencie and impenitencie condemnation now of these degrees the first is the least amp the last is the greatest one and the same sin is less in tentation then in conception amp lesse in conception then in birth and greater in perfection then in all the former now from this doctrine of the increasing and lessening of sin in these respects we may gather that all sins are not alike or equall as the stoicks of auncient times and their followers haue falsely imagined for it hath bin prooued at large by induction of sundrie particulars that there are degrees of sinnes some less som greater some more offensiue and odious to god amp man some lesse and hat the circumstances of time place person and manner of doing doe serue to enlarge or extenuate the sinne commited if it be here alleadged that sin is nothing but the doing of that which is unlawful to be done and that this is equall in all man that sinne and therfore by consequent offences are equall i answer that in euery sin me must not consider the vnlawfulnes thereof onely but the reason why it should be unlawful and that is properly because it is a breach of god law and repugnant to his will reuealed in his word nowe there is no breach of a diuine law but it is more or lesse repugnant vnto the will of the lawgiuer god himselfe and many transgressions are more repugnat thereunto then fewer for the more sin is increased the more is the wrath of god in lamed against the sinner vpon his due desert if it be said againe that the nature of sin stands onely in this that the sinner makes an aberration from the scope or marke that is set before him and doth no more then passe the bondes of dutie prescribed by god and that all are alike in this respect the answer is that it is a falshood to affirme that he which makes the lesse aberration from the dutie commanded is equall in offence to him that makes the greater for the same sin for substance hath sundrie steps and degrees in respect whereof one man becommeth a more heinous offender then another for example in the seauenth commandemet when god forbiddes the committing of adultery he forbiddeth three degrees of the same sinne to wit adulterie of the heart consisting of inordinate and vncleane affections adulterie of the tongue in corrupt dishonest and vnseemely speeches and the very act of vncleannesse and filthinesse committed by the bodie now it cannot be said that he which breakes this commandement onely in the first degree is as great a transgressour as he that hath proceeded to the second and so to the third and therefore it remaines for an vndoubted truth that sinnes committed against the law of god are not equall but some less some greater sundrie other distinctions there are of sinnes as namely that the main sinnes of the first table are greater then the maine sins of the second table and yet the maine sinnes of the second are greater then the breach of ceremoniall duties against the first table but this which hath beene said shall suffice the vse of this doctrine is manifold first by it we learne what the heart of man is by nature namely a corrupt and vncleane fountaine out of which issueth in the course of this life the streames of corruptions infinite in number noysome in qualities hainous in degrees dagerous in effects for from thence doe flow all the differences of sinnes before named with their seuerall branches and infinite many more that cannot be rehearsed this must mooue vs humbly to sue vnto god amp earnestly to entreat him to wash vs throughly from our wickednes amp clense vs from our sinnes yes to purge and to rinse the fountaine thereof our vncleane and polluted hearts and when by god mercie in christ apprehended by faith our hearts shall be purified the to set watch amp ward ouer them and to keep them with all diligence secondly it teacheth vs that miserable mortal man is not guiltie of one or more sinnes but of many amp sundrie corruptions both of heart and life who can vnderstand his faults saith dauid now the alowance of sinne beeing death by god ordinace amp god being iustice it selfe answerably to the number of our offences must we needes be lyable to many punishments yes to death it selfe both of the bodie and of the soule this beeing our wofull estate little cause is there that any man should thinke himselfe to be in good case or presume of god mercie in regard of the small number of his sinnes and much lesse cause hath he falsly to imagine with the popish sort that he can merit the fauour of god by any worke done by him aboue that which the law requireth considering that it is impossible for him to know either the number or the nature or the measure of his sinnes lastly the consideration of this point must be a barre to keepe vs in that we be not too secure or presumptuous of our owne estate for as much as we learne out of the word of god that in respect of the multitude of our corruptions this our life is full of much euill and many difficulty that wee haue whole armies of enemy to encounter with all not onely out of vs in the world abroad but within vs lurking euen in our owne flesh and vpon this consideration that we should be at cotinuall defiance with them vsing all holy meanes to get the victorie ouer them by the daily exercises of inuocation and repentance and by a continuall practise of new obedience vnto all the lawes and commandements of god according to the measure of grace receiued and so much of the third ground of the subiection and power of conscience the fourth and last ground is touching the subiection and power of conscience wherein we are to remember two things what conscience is and what is the naturall condition of it in every man for the first the name of conscience will giue light to the thing it selfe for it signifieth a knowledge ioyned with a knowledge and it is so tearmed in two respects first because when a man knowes or thinks any thing by meanes of conscience he knows what he knowes amp thinks secondly because by it man knowes that thing of himselfe which god also knowes of him man hath two witnesses of his thoughtes god and his owne conscience god is the first and chiefest and conscience is the second subordinate vnto god bearing witnes vnto god either with the man or against him therefore it is nothing els but a part of the vnderstanding whereby a man knowes what he thinkes what he wills and desires as also in what manner he knoweth thinketh or willeth either good or euill wherevnto this must be added that as consciece knowes our thoughts wils amp actions so it testifies thereof vnto god either with vs or against vs in the second place the naturall condition or propertie of euery mans conscience is this that in regard of authoritie and power it is placed in the middle betweene man and god so as it is vnder god and yet aboue man and this naturall condition hath two parts the first is the subiection of conscience to god and his word concerning which subiection we haue this rule that god alone by his word doth onely bind the conscience by causing it in euerie action either to excuse for well doeing or accuse for sinne and this god doth properly for first he is the onely lord of the conscience which created it and gouernes it againe he is the only law giuer that hath power to saue or destroy the soule for the keeping amp breaking of his lawes iam and further mans conscience is knowne to none besides himselfe but to god what man knoweth the things of a man saue the spirit of a man which is in him corinthian and it is god onely that giues liberty to the conscience in regard of his owne lawes vpon this it followeth that no mans commandement or law can of it selfe and by it owne soueraigne power bind conscience but doth it onely by the authoritie and vertue of the written word of god or some part thereof and therefore if it be alleadged that subiection is due to the magistrate for conscience sake rom the answer is at hand that subiection is indeede to be performed to ciuill authoritie ordained by god and obediece also to the lawes of the magistrate for feare of wrath and for auoiding of punishment but not for conscience of the said authoritie or lawes properly and directly but for conscience of god commandemet which appointeth both magistracie and the authoritie thereof this is it that bindes the conscience immediatly that by vertue of a superiour law whereby it standeth in force namely the law of god the second part of the naturall condition of conscience is the power which it hath ouer man to accuse or excuse him in respect of things done and this is plaine by saint pauls conclusion whatsoeuer is not of faith that is whatsoeuer man doth whereof he is not certenly perswaded in judgement and conscience out of god word that the thing may be done it is sinne more plainely a thing may be said not to be done of faith three waies first whe it is done with doubting and vnresolued conscience as in those that are weake in knowledge of which sort were some in the primitiue church who notwithstanding they heard of the doctrine of christian libertie yet they were of opinion that after christs ascension there was a difference to be made of meates and thereupon thought they might not eate of some kind of meats suppose now that these persons by accident should haue been drawne to eate swines flesh which themselues had holden a thing forbidden these man vpon this very fact had sinned because that which they did was vpon an vnresolued conscience so saith the apostle rom he that doubteth is condemned if he eate because he eateth not of faith secondly when a thing is done vpon an erronious conscience it is not of faith and therefore it is a sinne thus the masse priest sinneth in saying masse though he thinke in his conscience the thing he doth is the ordinance of god and thus heretikes doe die heretikes though when they die they be fully perswaded there opinions be the truth againe in the same manner put the case a man should be of opinion that fornication or theft were things arbitrarie and indifferent and hereupon his conscience should tel him he might take opportunitie and commit either of these sinnes whether is this action in the partie thus perswaded a sinne or no i answer the case is plaine that the fact is done vpon an erronious conscience and therefore must be a sinne in the doer for the error of the iudgement cannot take away the nature of that which is simply euill sinne is sinne and so remaineth notwithstanding any contrarie perswasion of the consciece the reason is because though the conscience erreth and is misinformed yet it bindeth so farre forth as that if a man iudge a thing to be euill either simply or in some respect though falsely and yet afterward doth it he hath sinned and offended the maiestie of god as much as in him lieth thirdly when a thing as done with a repugning or gainsaying conscience though vpon error and false iudgement of the conscience it is in the doer a sinne thus an anabaptist that holdeth it unlawful to sweare sinneth if he take an oath not in swearing simply for that is god ordinance but because he sweares against the perswasion of his conscience of the distinction of cases thus much touching the preambles or grounds of this doctrine now it remaineth that we come to the questions of conscience these questions may be fitly deuided according to the matter or subiect of them which is man now as man is considered diverse waies that is to say either a part y himselfe or as he stands in relation to an other and is a member of a societie so the questions of conscience are to be distinguished some concerning man simply considered by himselfe some againe as he stands in relation to an other man standeth in a twofold relation to god or to man as he stands in relation to god he beares the name of a christian that is a member of christ or a son of god whose dutie is to know and to worship god according to his will reuealed in his word as he stands in relation to man he is a part of a bodie and a member of some societie now the questions that concerne him as a member of a societie are of three sorts according to three distinct kinds of societies for euery man is either a member of a familie or of the church or of the commonwealth and answerably some questions concerne ma as a member of a familie some as he is a member of the church some as he is a member of the commonwealth in a word therefore all questions touching man may be reduced to three generall heads the first whereof is concerning man simply considered as he is a man the second touching man as he stands in relation to god the third concerning man as he is a member of one of the three societies that is either of the familie or of the church or of the commonwealth qvestions of the first sort concerning man simply considered in himselfe as he is a man are especially three the first what a man must doe that he may come into the fauour of god and be saued the second how he may be assured in conscience of his owne saluation the third how he may recouer himselfe when he is distressed or fallen of these in order of the first maine question touching man for answer to this question some groundes must be laid downe beforehand the first is this that we must consider and remember how and by what meanes god brings any man to saluation for looke how god saueth others so he that would know how to be saued must vse the meanes whereby god saueth them in the working and effecting of mans saluation ordinarily there are two special actions of god the giuing of the first grace and after that the giuing of the second the former of these two works hath x seuerall actions i god giues man the outward meanes of saluation specially the ministerie of the word and with it he sends some outward or inward crosse to breake and sub due the stubbornnesse of our nature that it may be made plyable to the will of god this we may see in the example of the iaylour act and of the iewes that were conuerted at peters sermon act ii this done god brings the minde of man to a consideration of the law and therein generally to see what is good and what is euill what is sinne and what is not sinne iii vpon a serious consideration of the law he makes a man particularly to see and know his owne peculiar and proper sinnes whereby he offends god iv vpon the sight of sinne he smites the heart with a legall feare whereby when man seeth his sinnes he makes him to feare punishment and hell and to despaire of saluation in regard of any thing in himselfe now these foure actions are indeede no fruits of grace for a reprobate may goe thus farre but they are onely workes of preparation going before grace the other actions which follow are effects of grace v the fifth action of grace therefore is to stirre vp the minde to a serious consideration of the promise of saluation propounded and published in the gospel vi after this the sixt is to kindle in the heart some seedes or sparks of faith that is a will and desire to beleeue and grace to striue against doubting amp dispaire now at the same instant when god beginnes to kindle in the heart any sparkes of faith then also he iustifies the sinner and withall begins the worke of sanctification vii then so soone as faith is put into the heart there is presently a combat for it fighteth with doubting dispaire and distrust and in this combate faith shews it selfe by feruent costant amp earnest inuocatio for pardon and after inuocation followes a strength and preuailing of this desire viii furthermore god in mercie quiets and settles the conscience as touching the saluation of the soule and the promise of life where vpon it resteth and staieth it selfe ix next after this setled assurance amp perswasion of mercy followes a stirring vp of the heart to euangelicall sorrow according to god that is a griefe for sinne because it is sinne and because god is offended and then the lord workes repentance wherby the sanctified heart turnes it selfe vnto him and though this repentance be one of the last in order yet it shewes it selfe first as when a candle is brought into a roome we first see the light before wee see the candle and yet the candle must needs be before the light can be x lastly god giues a man grace to endeauor to obey his commaundements by a new obedience and by these degrees doth the lord giue the first grace the second worke of god tending to saluation is the giuing of the second grace which is nothing else but the continuance of the first grace giuen for looke as by creation god gaue a beeing to man amp all other creatures and then by his prouidence continued the same beeing which was as it were a second creation so in bringing a man to saluation god giues the first grace for example to beleeue amp repent amp then in mercie giues the second to persevere amp continue in faith and repentance to the end and this if we regard man himselfe is very necessary for as fire without supply of matter wherby it is fedde amp continued would soone goe out so vnlesse god of his goodnesse should followe his children and by new and daily supplies continue his first grace in the they would vndoubtedly soone loose the same amp finally fall away the second ground for the answere of this question is taken from some speciall places of scripture where the same is mooved and resolued the man that were at peters sermon being touched with the sense of their owne miserie vpon the doctrine which had beene deliuered as the holy ghost saies were pricked in their hearts and cried one to an other man amp brother what shall we doe peter mooued by the spirit of god answers them repent and be baptized for the remission of your sinnes the like was the case of the iaylor who after that the stubbornnesse of his heart was beaten downe by feare of the departure of the prisoners he came trembling and fell downe before paul and silas and mooued this question vnto them sirs what must i doe to be saued to whome they gaue answer beleeue in the lord iesus and thou shalt be saued and thine houshold the young man in the gospel sues to christ and askes him what shall i doe to be saued christs answers him keepe the commandements when he replied that he had kept them from his youth christ tels him that he must goe yet further and sell all that he hath and giue to the poore and john tells the scribes and pharises who came vnto his baptisme and confessed their sinnes that if they would flie from the wrath to come they must repent and bring forth fruits worthie amendment of life from these places then i frame this answer to the question in hand the man that would stand in the fauour of god and be saued must doe foure things first humble himselfe before god secondly beleeue in christ thirdly repent of his sinnes fourthly performe new obedience vnto god for the first humiliation is indeode a fruit of faith yet i put it in place before faith because in practise it is first faith lieth hid in the heart and the first effect whereby it appeares is the abasing and humbling of our selues and here we are further to consider three points first wherein stands humiliation secondly the excellencie of it thirdly the questions of conscience that concerne it touching the first point humiliation stands in the practise of three things the first is a sorrow of heart whereby the sinner is displeased with himself amp ashamed in respect of his sinnes the second is a confession to god wherin also three things are to be done first to acknowledge all our maine sinnes originall and actuall secondly to acknowledge our guiltinesse before god thirdly to acknowledge our iust damnation for sinne the third thing in humiliation is supplication made to god for mercie as earnestly as in a matter of life and death and of these three things we haue in scripture the examples of ezra daniel and the prodigall son ezra daniel luke the second point is the excellencie of humiliation which stands in this that it hath the promises of life eternall annexed to it isaiah i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart psalm a contrite and a broken heart o god thou wilt not despise prov he that hideth his sinnes shall not prosper but he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall finde mercie ioh if we acknowledge our sinnes he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnes by all these and many other places it is manifest that in the very instant when a sinner beginnes truly in heart and conscience to humble himselfe he is then entred into the state of saluation so soone as dauid said i haue sinned nathan pronounceth in the name of the lord that his sinnes were put away and dauid himselfe saith alluding to the former place i said i will confesse my sinne and loc thou forgauest the wickednes of my sinne when the prodigall son had but said i will goe to my father ampc euen then before he humbled himselfe his father meetes him and receiues him the third point is touching the questions of conscience concerning humiliation all which may be reduced to foure principall cases i case what if it fall out that a man in humbling himselfe cannot call to minde either all or the most of his sinnes i answer a particular humiliation indeed is required for maine and knowne sinnes but yet there are two cases wherein generall repentance will be accepted of god for vnknowne sinnes one is when a man hath searched himselfe diligently and by a serious examination passed through all the commaundements of god and yet after such examination and search made his particular offences are yet hidden and not reuealed vnto him so as he cannot call them to remembrance then the generall repentance is accepted for this is answerable to the practise of dauid who after long search when he could not attaine to the knowledge of his particular slippes then he addresseth himselfe to a generall humiliation saying who knoweth the errours of this life clense me lord from my secret faults and vpon this he was no doubt accepted againe when a man humbleth himselfe and yet is preuented by the time so as he cannot search his heart and life as he would his generall repentance will be taken and accepted of god the truth hereof appeares in the theefe vpon the crosse who hauing no time to search himselfe made no speciall humiliation yet vpon his generall confession he was accepted now the ground of this doctrine is this he that truly repents of one sinne in this case when he is preuented is as if he repented of all ii case what must a man doe that findes himselfe hard hearted and of a dead spirit so as he cannot humble himselfe as he would answer such persons if they humble themselues they must be content with that grace which they haue receiued for if thou be truly and vnfainedly grieued for this that thou canst not be grieued thy humiliation shall be accepted for that which paul saith of almes may be truly said in this case that if there be a readie minde a man shall be accepted according to that he hath and not according to that he hath not iii case whether the party that is more grieued for losse of his friend then for offece of god by his sinne doeth or can truly humble himselfe answer a man may haue a greater griefe for an earthly losse then for the other and yet be truly greiued for his sinnes too the reason is because that is a bodily naturall and sensible losse and accordingly sorrow for it is naturall now the sorrow for the offending of god is no sensible thing but supernaturall and spirituall and sensible things doe more affect amp urge the minde then the other dauid did notably humble himselfe for his sinnes and he did exceedingly mourne for the losse of his son absolom yes and more too then for his sinnes would god i had died for thee absolom o absolom my son my son ampc againe i answer that the sorrow of the minde must be measured by the intention of the affection amp by the estimation of the thing for which we sorrow now sorrow for sinne though it be lesse in respect of the intention thereof yet is it greater in respect of the estimation of the mind because they which truly mourn for their sins grieue for the offence of god as the greatest euill of all and for the losse of the fauour of god as for losse of the most excellent amp pretious thing in the world iv case whether it be necessarie in humiliation that the heart should be smitten with a sensible sorrow answer i in sorrow for sinne ther are two things first to be displeased for our sinns secondly to haue a bodily moouing of the heart which causeth crying and teares the former of these is necessarie namely in heart to be deepely displeased with our selues the latter is not simply necessary though it be commendable in whomsoeuer it is if it be in truth for lydia had the first but not the second ii it falleth out oftetimes that the greatnes of the grief taketh away the sensible paine and causeth a mummednesse of the heart so that the partie grieueth not iii sometimes the complexion will not affoard teares and in such there may be true humiliation though with dric cheekes the secod thing to be done for the attaining of god fauour and confequently of saluatio is to beleeue in christ in the practise of a christian life the duties of humiliation amp faith cannot be seuered yet for doctrines sake i distinguish them in faith ther are two things required and to be performed on our behalfe first to know the points of religion and namely the summe of the gospel especially the promise of righteousnes and life eternall by christ secondly to apprehend and applie the promise and withall the thing promised which is christ vnto our selues and this is done when a man vpon the commandemet of god sets down this with himselfe that christ and his merits belong vnto him in particular and that christ is his wisdome iustification sanctification and redemption this doctrine is plaine out of the sixt of john for christ is there propounded vnto vs as the bread and the water of life therefore faith must not be idle in the braine but it must take christ and applie him vnto the soule and conscience euen as meate is eaten the questions of conscience touching faith are these first how we may truly applie christ with all his benefits vnto our selues for wicked man applie christ vnto themselues falsely in presumption but fewe doe it truly as they ought to doe i answer that this may be done we must remember to doe two things first lay downe a foundation of this action and then practise vpon it our foundation must be laid in the word or else we shall faile in our application and it consists of two principles the one is as god giues a promise of life eternall by christ so he giues commandement that euery one in particular should applie the promise to himselfe the next is that the ministerie of the word is an ordinarie meanes wherein god doth offer and applie christ with all his benefits to the hearers as if he called them by their names peter john cornelius beleeue in christ and thou shalt be saued when we haue rightly considered of our foundation the second thing is to practise vpon it and that is to giue our selues to the exercises of faith and repentance which stand in meditation of the word and prayer for mercie and pardon and when this is done then god giues the sense and increase of his grace when lydia was hearing the sermon of paul then god opened her heart act v secondly it is demaunded when faith beginnes to breede in the heart and when a man beginnes to beleeue in christ answer when he beginnes to be touched in conscience for his owne sinnes and withall hungers and thirsts after christ and his righteousnes then beginneth faith the reason is plaine as faith is renewed so it is begunne but it is renewed when a man is touched in conscience for his sinnes and beginnes a new to hunger after christ therefore when these things first shew themselues then faith first beginnes for these were the things that were in dauid when he renewed his repentance the third dutie necessarie to saluation is repentance in which two things are to be considered the beginning namely a godly sorrow which is the beginning of repentance corinthian and vpon this sorrow a change which is indeede repentance it selfe in sorrow we consider first the nature of it secondly the properties of it touching the nature of sorrow it is either inward or outward the inward sorrow is when a man is displeased with himselfe for his sinnes the outward when the heart declares the griefe thereof by teares or such like signes and sorrow in this case called a godly sorrow is more to be esteemed by the first of these then by the second the propertie of this sorrow is to make vs to be displeased with our selues for our sinnes directly because they are sinnes and doe displease god if there were no iudge no hel nor death yet we must be grieued because we haue offended so mercifull a god and louing father and as godly sorrow will make vs thus to doe so is it the next cause of repentance and by this is repentance discerned the next thing in repentace is the change of the minde and whole man in affection life and conuersation and this standeth in a constant purpose of the minde and resolution of the heart not to sinne but in euery thing to doe the will of god hereupon paul exhorteth them to whome he wrote to continue in the loue of god and in the obedience of his word barnabas when he came to antioch and had seene the grace of god was glad and exhorted all that with purpose of heart they should cleaue vnto god or continue with the lord so the prophet ezckiel saith if the wicked will turne from all his sinnes and keepe all my statutes and doe that which is lawful and right he shall surely liue and shall not die in this purpose stands the very nature of repentance and it must be ioyned with humiliation and faith as a third thing auaileable to saluation and not to be seuered from them for a man in shewe may haue many good things as for example he may be humbled and seeme to haue some strength of faith yet if there be in the saide man a want of this purpose and resolution not to sinne the other are but dead things and vnprofitable and for all them he may come to eternall destruction furthermore we must distinguish this kinde of purpose from the minde and purpose of carnall man theeues drunkards harlots vsurers for they will confesse their sinnes and be sorie for them yes and shed some teares wishing they had neuer sinned as they haue in these man indeed there is a wishing will for the time but no setled purpose and it is a propertie of nature to auoid euill but to haue a constant resolution of not sinning is a gift of grace and for this it is that we must labour otherwise our repentance is no true and sound repentance the fourth and last dutie is to performe new obedience vnto god in our life and conuersation in this new obedience three things are required first it must be a fruit of the spirit of christ in vs for when we doe any good thing it is christ that doth it in vs to this purpose dauid praies vnto god psalm let thy good spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousnes and paul exhorts the galatians to walke in the spirit and then marke what followes and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh gal secondly this new obedience must be the keeping of euery commandement of god for as s iames saith he that breakes one commandement is guiltie of all that is he that doth willingly and wittingly breake any commandement and makes not conscience of some one maketh not conscience of any and before god he is as guiltie of all as if he had broken all thirdly in new obedience the whole man must endeauour to keepe the whole law in his minde will affections and all the faculties of soule and bodie as it is said of iosiah that he turned to god according to all the lawes of moses with all his heart this last point added to the rest is the very forme and life of new obedience amp from hence it followes first that therepentant person must not liue in the practise of any outward sinne secondly that there must be in him an inward resisting and restraining of the corruption of nature and of the heart that he may truly obey god by the grace of the spirit of god the heart of ioseph was readie prest to resist the euill request of potiphars wife and dauid staid his affectio from reuenging himselfe vpon shemei when he cursed him thirdly that he ought to stirre vp and exercise the inward man by all spiritual motions of faith ioy loue hope and the praise of god now touching this point there are principal questions propouded first how may a man frame his life to liue in new bedience ans though all the bookes of the old and new testament are direction sufficient for a good life yet a more speciall answer may be made out of the same plainly and briefly that there are three maine grounds or rules of new obedience the first is laid downe by our sauiour christ luke if any man will come after me let him denie himselfe and take vp his crosse and follow me the meaning is this euery one that will become a scholer in the schoole of christ and learn obedience vnto god must deny himselfe that is he must in the first place exalt and magnifie the grace of god and become nothing in himselfe renouncing his owne reason will amp affections and subiecting them to the wisdome amp will of god in all things yes esteeming al things in the earth euen those that are dearest vnto him as drosse and dung in regard of the kingdome of christ againe he must take vp his crosse that is he ought alwaies to make a forehand reckoning euen of priuate crosses and particular afflictions and when they come to beare them with chearefulnesse this done he must follow christ by practising the vertues of meekenes patience loue and obedience and by beeing conformable to his death in crucifying the bodie of sinne in himselfe the second rule is propounded by paul act to beleeue all things that are written in the law and the prophets and that is to hold and embrace the same faith which was embraced by the saints and servant of god in auncient times and which was written by moses and the prophets againe in all reuerence to subiect himselfe to the true manner of worshipping and seruing god reuealed in his word and not to depart from the same doctrine and worship either to the right hand or to the left the third and last rule is to haue and to keepe faith and a good conscience tim now faith is preserued by knowledge of the doctrine of the law and the gospel by yeelding assent vnto the same doctrine beleeuing it to be true and by a particular application of it vnto a mans selfe specially of the promise of righteousnesse and life euerlasting in and by christ againe that a man may keepe a good conscience he must doe three things first in the course of his life he must practise the duties of the generall calling in the particular so as though they be two distinct in nature yet they may be both one in vse and practise secondly in all euents that come to passe euermore in patience and silence he must submit himselfe to the good will and pleasure of god thus it is saide of aaron that when god had destroied his sonnes for offer vp strange fire before him he held his peace levit and dauid shewes that it was his practise when beeing afflicted he saith i was as dumbe and opened not my mouth because thou lord didst it psalm thirdly if at any time he falleth either through infirmitie the malice of satan or the violence of some temptation he must humble himselfe before god labour to breake off his sinne and recouer himselfe by repentance and these three be the principall and maine grounds of new obedience the second question considering that all good works are the fruits of a regenerate person and are contained vnder new obedience how may a man doe a good worke that may be accepted of god and please him for resolution whereof it is to be carefully remembred that to the doing of a good worke sundrie things are required whereof some in nature doe goe before the worke to be done some doe accompanie the doing thereof and some againe doe follow the worke beeing required to be done when the worke is done before the worke there must goe reconciliation whereby the person is reconciled vnto god in christ and made acceptable to him for it is a cleare case that no worke of man ca be accepted of god vnles the person of the worker be approoued of him and the workes of man of what dignitie soeuer are not to be esteemed by the shewe and outward appearance of them but by the minde and condition of the doer againe before we doe any good worke we must by praier lift vp our hearts vnto god and desire him to inable vs by his spirit to doe it and to guide vs by the same in the action which we are about to doe this did the prophet dauid oftentimes as we may read in the psalmes but especially in psalm when he saith teach me to doe thy will o god for thou article my god let thy good spirit l d me vnto the land of righteousnes and oftentimes in the psalme teach me o lord the way of thy statutes verse giue me vnderstanding direct me in the path of thy commandements againe teach me iudgement and knowledge let my heart be vpright in thy statutes stablish me according to thy promise direct my steppes in thy word and let none iniquitie haue dominion ouer me in the doing of the worke we are to consider two things the matter and the manner or forme of doing it for the matter it must be a worke commanded in the word of god either expressely or generally for it is god reuealed will that giues the goodnes to any worke christ saith of the pharises that they worshipped him in vaine teaching for doctrines the commandements of man he therefore that will doe a worke tending to the worship of god must doe that which god commandeth now actions expressely commanded are the duties of the morall law actions generally commanded are all such as serue to be helpes and meanes to further the said morall duties and here we must remember that actions indifferent in the case of offence or edification cease to be indifferent and come vnder some commandement of the morall law to which purpose paul saith if eating flesh will offend my brother i will eate no flesh while the world standeth his meaning is that though his eating of flesh was a thing indifferent in it selfe yet in case of offence his minde was to abstaine from it as much as from the breach of the law of god againe if an action indifferent comes within the case of furthering the good of the commonwealth or church it ceaseth to be indifferent and comes vnder commandement and so all kind of callings and their works though neuer so base may be the matter of good workes this point is to be remembred for it serueth to incourage euery man of what condition soeuer he be in the diligent performance of the duties of his calling as also to confute the doctrine of the popish church which teacheth that onely almes deedes and building or maintaining of churches and religious houses are the matter of good works now to the manner or forme of a good work there is required faith for as without faith it is impossible to please god hebr so whatsoeuer worke is vndertaken without faith cannot in any sort be acceptable vnto him what faith then is required in this case i answer first a general faith whereby we are perswaded that the thing to be done may lawfully be done and of this the apostle speaketh when he saith whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne secondly a particular or iustifying faith which purifieth the heart and maketh it fit to bring forth a good work for it giues a beginning to the worke and also couers the wants and defects thereof by apprehending and applying vnto vs christ and his merits againe a good worke for the maner thereof must be done in obedience for knowing that the thing to be done is commanded of god we must haue a minde and intention to obey god in the thing we doe according to his comandement if it be here demanded seeing workes must be done in obedience how and to what part of the word we must direct our obedience i answer to the law but howe not considered in his rigour but as it is qualified mollified and tepered by the gospell for according to the rigour of the lawe which commandes perfect obedience no man can possibly doe a good worke furthermore touching the maner it must be done to good and lawful ends the ends of a good worke are manifold first the honour and glory of god whether ye eate or drinke or whatsoeuer ye doe doe all to the glory of god secondly the testification of our thankfulnes vnto god that hath redeemed vs by christ the third is to edifie our neighbour and to further him in the way to life euerlasting math let your light so shine before man that they may see your good works amp glorifie your father which is in heauen the fourth is to exercise and increase our faith amp repentance both which be much strengthned and confirmed by the practise of good workes fiftly that we may escape the punishment of sinne the destruction of the wicked and obtaine the reward of the righteous life euerlasting this was the end that paul aymed at in the course of his calling to which purpose he saith from henceforth there is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse which the lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day tim sixtly that we may be answerable to our calling in doeing the duties thereof and in walking as children of light redeemed by christ iesus when dauid kept his fathers sheepe he behaued himselfe as a sheepheard but when he was annointed king ouer israell god gaue him an heart amp resolution to carry himselfe as a king amp gouernour of his people looke then as dauid did so ought we euen by our workes to be answerable to our callings seuenthly that we may pay the debt which we owe vnto god for we are debters to him in sundry regardes as we are his creatures as we are his servant as we are his children in a word as we are redeemed by christ and our whole debt is our dutie of praise and thanks giuing after the worke is done then comes the acceptation of it god accepts of our works diverse waies first in that he pardoneth the fault which comes from vs secondly in that he approoues his owne good worke in vs thirdly in that he doth giue vnto the doers of them a crowne of righteousnes and glorie according to his promise tim reverand we then after we haue done the work must humble our selues and intreat the lord to pardon the wants of our workes and say with dauid lord enter not into iudgement with thy servant amp with daniel lord vnto vs belongeth open shame amp confusio but to thee righteousnes compassion and forgiuenes and the reason is plaine because in vs there is no goodnesse no holinesse no righteousnes nor any thing that may present vs acceptable in his sight amp for this cause paul saith i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not therby iustified great reason then that we should huble ourselues before god for our wants and pray vnto him that he will in mercie accept our indeauour and confirme the good worke begunne in vs by his holy spirit of the second maine question touching assurance of saluation before i come to the question it selfe this conclusion is to be laid downe as a mayne ground that election vocatio faith adoption iustificatio sanctification amp eternal glorification are neuer separated in the saluation of any man but like inseparable companions go hand in hand so as he that can be assured of one of them may infallibly conclude in his owne heart that he hath and shall haue interest in all the other in his due time this is plaine by the words of s paul rom whome he predestinate them also he called whome he called them also he iustified whome he iustified them also he glorified in which place the apostle compares the causes of saluation to a chaine of many linkes whereof euery one is so coupled to the other that he which taketh hold of the highest must needes carrie all the rest with him againe amongst these linkes faith is one a principall grace of god whereby man is ingrafted into christ and thereby becomes one with christ and christ one with him ephesians now whosoeuer is by faith vnited vnto christ the same is elected called iustified and sanctified the reason is manifest for in a chaine the two extremes are knit togither by the middle linkes and in the order of causes of happinesse and saluation faith hath a middle place and by it hath the child of god assured hold of his election and effectuall vocation and consequently of his glorification in the kingdome of heauen to this purpose saith s john c v he that beleeueth in the son hath euerlasting life and c v he that beleeues in him that sent me hath euerlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but hath passed from death to life this is the ground now for answer to the question diverse places of scripture are to be skanned wherein this case of conscience is fully answered and resolued the first place is rom and the spirit of god testifieth together with our spirits that we are the sonnes of god in these words are two testimonies of our adoption set downe the first is the spirit of god dwelling in vs and testifying vnto vs that we are god childre but some will happily demaund how god spirit giues witnesse seeing now there are no reuelations answer extraordinarie reuelations are ceased and yet the holy ghost in and by the word reuealeth some things vnto man for which cause he is called truly the spirit of reuelation ephesians againe the holy ghost giues testimonie by applying the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by christ particularly to the heart of man when the same is generally propounded in the ministerie of the word and because many are readie presumptuously to say they are the children of god when they are not and that they haue the witnesse of god spirit when in truth they want it therefore we are to put a difference between this carnall conceit and the true testimonie of the spirit now there be two things whereby they may be discerned one from the other the first is by the meanes for the true testimonie of the holy ghost is wrought ordinarily by the preaching reading and meditation of the word of god as also by praier and the right vse of the sacraments but the presumptuous testimonie ariseth in the heart and is framed in the braine out of the vse of these meanes or though in the vse yet with want of the blessing of god concurring with the meanes the second is by the effects and fruits of the spirit for it stirrs vp the heart to praier and inuocation of the name of god zach yes it causeth a man to crie and call earnestly vnto god in the time of distresse with a sense and feeling of his owne miseries and with deepe sighes and groanes which cannot be vttered to cra e mercie and grace at his hands as of a louing father rom thus did moses crie vnto heauen in his heart when he was in distresse at the red sea exod and this gift of praier is an vnfallible testimonie of god spirit which cannot stand with carnall presumption the second testimonie of our adoption is our spirit that is our conscience sanctified and renewed by the holy ghost and this also is knowne and discerned first by the greefe of the heart for offending god called godly sorrow corinthian secondly by a resolute purpose of the heart and endeauour of the whole man in all things to obey god thirdly by sauouring the things of the spirit rom that is by doing the workes of the spirit with ioy and chearefulnesse of heart as in the presence of god and as his children and servant now put the case that the testimonie of the spirit be wanting then i answer that the other testimonie the sanctification of the heart will suffice to assure vs we knowe it sufficiently to be true and not painted fire if there be heate though there be no flame put the case againe that the testimonie of the spirit be wanting and our sanctification be vncertaine vnto vs how then may we be assured the answer is that we must the haue recourse to the first beginnings and motions of sanctificatio which are these first to feele our inward corruptions secondly to be displeased with our selues for them thirdly to beginne to hate sinne fourthly to grieue so oft as we fal and offend god fiftly to auoid the occasions of sinne sixtly to endeauour to doe our dutie and to vse good meanes seuenthly to desire to sinne no more and lastly to pray to god for his grace where these and the like motions are there is the spirit of god whence they proceed and sanctification is begun one apple is sufficient to manifest the life of the tree and one good and constant motion of grace is sufficient to manifest sanctification againe it may be demanded what must be done if both be wanting answer man must not dispaire but vse good meanes and in time they shall be assured the second place is the psalme in the first verse whereof this question is propounded namely who of all the members of the church shall haue his habitation in heauen the answer is made in the verses following and in the second verse he sets downe three generall notes of the said person one is to walke vprightly in sincerity approuing his heart and life to god the second is to deale iustly in al his doings the third is for speech to speake the truth from the heart without guile or flatterie and because we are easily deceiued in generall sinnes in the and verses there are set downe seauen more euident and sensible notes of sinceritie iustice and trueth one is in speech not to take vp or carrie abroad false reports and slanders the second is in our dealings not to doe wrong to our neighbour more then to our selues the third is in our company to contemne wicked persons worthy to be contemned the fourth is in our estimation we haue of others amp that is to honour them that feare god the fift is in our words to sweare and not to change that is to make conscience of our word and promise especially if if it be confirmed by oath the sixt is in taking of gaine not to giue money to vsurie that is not to take increase for bare lending but to lend freely to the poore the last is to giue testimonie without briberie or partialitie in the fift verse is added a reason of the answer he that in his indeauour doth al these things shall neuer be mooued that is cut off from the church as an hypocrite the third place of scripture is the first epistle of john the principall scope wherof is to giue a full resolution to the conscience of man touching the certainty of his saluation and the principall grounds of assurance which are there laid downe may be reduced to three heads the first is this he that hath communion or fellowship with god in christ may be vndoubtedly assured of his saluation this conclusion is propounded chap v where the apostle tels the church that the end of the preaching of the gospell vnto them was that they might haue fellowship not onely mutually among themselues but also with god the father and with his son iesus christ and further that hauing both knowledge amp assurance of this heauenly communion to be begun in this life and perfected in the life to come their ioy might be full that is they might thence reape matter of true ioy and sound comfort vnto their soules and consciences now whereas it might be haply demauded by some beleeuers how they should come to this assurance s john answeres in this epistle that the certainty therof may be gathered by foure infallible notes the first is remission of sinnes for though god be in himselfe most holy and pure and no mortall man being vncleane and polluted by sinne can haue fellowship with him yet god hath shewed his mercy to those that beleeue in him and hath accepted of the blood of iesus christ his son whereby they are clensed from all their corruptions v if here it be asked how this pardon and forgiuenes may be knowne it is answered by two signes one is huble and heartie confession of our sins vnto god for so saith the apostle if we confesse our sins he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sins and to clense vs from all iniquitie v the other is the pacified conscience for being iustified by faith we haue peace with god and if our heart condemne vs not that is if our conscience in respect of sinne doth not accuse vs then haue we boldnesse towards god chap v the second note of fellowship with god is the sanctifying spirit wherby we are renewed in holines amp righteousnes hereby we know that he abideth in vs euen by the spirit which he hath giuen vs chap v the third is holinesse and vprightnes of heart and life to this end the apostle saith if we say that we haue fellowship with him and walke in darkenes we lie and doe not truly but if we walke in the light as he is in the light we haue fellowship one with an other ampc chap the fourth is perseuerance in the knowledge and obedience of the gospel so the same apostle exhorteth the church let therefore abide in you that same doctrine concerning christ which ye haue heard from the beginning if that which ye haue heard from the beginning remaine in you that is if ye beleeue and obey it you also shall continue in the same and in the father chap the second ground he that is the adopted son of god shall vndoubtedly be saued this point the apostle plainly declareth when he saith be loued now are we the sonnes of god and we knowe that is we are vndoubtedly assured by faith that when christ shall appeare in glory we shal be like vnto him for wee shall see him as he is that the latter part of these words is thus to be expounded i gather out of chap as also by comparing this text with that of s paul where he saith when christ which is our life shall appeare then shall we also appeare with him in glorie and againe if we be sonnes we are also heires euen the heires of god and heires annexed with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him nowe put the case that the conscience of the beleeuer will not rest in this but desires to be further resolued touching the certaintie of his adoption then i answer that he must haue recourse vnto the signes wherby a son of god may be discerned from a child of the deuill and these are principally three first is truly to beleeue in the name of the son of god for those that haue god for their father are made the sonnes of god by faith in iesus christ and this faith snewes it selfe by obedience for hereby we are sure that we knowe christ that is that we beleeue in him and apply him with all his benefits vnto our soules if we keepe his commandemets nay further he that saies i know him and keepes not his commandements is a liar and the trueth is not in him chap the second signe is a heartie desire and earnest in deauour to be cleansed of his corruptions euery son of god that hath this hope purifieth himselfe euen as christ is pure chap verse the third is the loue of a christian because he is a christian for hereby saies the apostle are the children of god knowne from the children of the deuill because the sonnes of satan doe hate their brother as cain did his brother abel euen for the good workes which they doe on the other side god adopted sonnes may hereby know themselues to be translated from death to life because they loue the brother chap ampc the third ground they that are assured of the loue of god to them in particular may also be certainly assured of their owne saluation this doctrine follows necessarily vpon the apostles words chap v for those whome god hath loued from all eternitie to them he hath manifested his loue by sending his onely begotten son into the world that they might liue through him eternally but how may a man be assured of god speciall loue and fauour the same apostle answers by two notes the first is the loue of our brother and that according to god commandement wherein it is commanded that he that loues god should loue his brother also and if any man say i loue god and hate his brother he is a liar for how can he that loueth not his brother whome he hath seene loue god whome he hath not seene now that a man deceiue not himselfe in the loue of his brother saint john giues three rules one that christian brotherly loue should not be for outward respects or considerations but principally because they are the sonnes of god and members of christ euery one that loueth him which did beget that is god the father loueth him also which is begotten of him another is that it must not be outward in shew onely but inward in the heart let vs not loue in word or in tongue onely but in deede and in truth lastly that it be not onely in time of prosperitie but when hee stands in most neede of our loue for whosoeuer hath this worlds good and seeth his brother haue neede and shutteth vp the bowels of copassio from him how dwelleth the loue of god in him the second note of god loue vnto vs is our loue of god for those whom god loueth in christ to them he giues his grace to loue him againe and this louing of him againe is an euident token of that loue wherewith he loueth them so saith the apostle we loue him be ause he loued vs first if it be demaunded howe a man may be assured that he loueth god the answer is hee may knowe it by two things first by his conformitie to him in holines the child that loues his father will be willing to tread in the steps of his father and so in like manner he that loueth god will indeauour euen as hee is so to be in this world but howe is that not in equalitie and perfection but in similitude and conformitie striuing to be holy as he is holy and indeauouring to doe his will in all things secondly by the weaning of his affection from the things of this world yes from all pleasures and delights of this present life so farre forth as they are seuered from the feare and loue of god loue not this world nor the things that are in the world if any man loue this world the loue of the father is not in him the fourth place is in the second of timothie the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his and let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the lord depart from iniquitie in these wordes paul goeth about to cut off an offence which the church might take by reason of the fall of hymenaeus and philetus who seemed to be pillars and principall man in the church and to confirme them against this offence he saith the foundation of god that is the decree of god election stands firme and sure so as those which are elected of god shall neuer fall away as these two haue done and this he declares by a double similitude first of all he saith the election of god is like the foundation of an house which standeth fast though all the building be shaken secondly he saith that election hath the seale of god and therefore may not be changed because things which are sealed are thereby made sure and authenticall nowe this seale hath two parts the first concerns god in that euery mans saluation is written in the booke of life and god knoweth who are his and because it might be said god indeede knowes who shall be saued but what is that to vs we know not so much of our selues therefore saint paul to answer this sets downe a second part of this seale which concerns man and is imprinted in his heart and conscience which also hath two branches the gift of invocation and a watchfull care to make conscience of al and euery sin in these words and let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the lord depart from iniquitie wherby he signifieth that those that can cal vpon god amp giue him thanks for his benefits and withall in their liues make conscience of sinne haue the seale of god election imprinted in their hearts and may assure themseles they are the lord a fift place of scripture touching this question is pet giue all diligence to make your election sure for if you doe these things you shall neuer fall which words containe two parts first an exhortation to make our election sure not with god for with him both it and all other things are vnchangeable but to ourselues in our owne hearts amp consciences secondly the meanes whereby to come to this assurance that is by doeing the things before named in the and verses and that is nothing else but to practise the vertues of the morall lawe there set downe which i will briefly shewe what they are as they lie in the text to faith adde vertue by faith he meaneth true religion and that gift of god whereby we put our trust and confidence in christ by vertue he meaneth no speciall vertue but as i take it an honest and vpright life before man shining in the vertues and workes of the morall law by knowledge he meanes a gift of god wherby a man may iudge how to carrie himselfe warily and vprightly before man by temperance is vnderstood a gift of god whereby we keepe a moderation of our naturall appetite especially about meat drinke amp attire by patience is ment a vertue whereby we moderate our sorrowe in induring affliction godlines is an other vertue whereby we worship god in the duties of the first table brotherly kindnesse is also that vertue whereby we imbrace the church of god amp the members thereof with the bowels of loue and in the last place loue is that vertue whereby we are well affected to all man euen to our enemy now hauing made a rehersal of these vertues in the tenth verse he saith if ye doe these things ye shall neuer fall that is to say if ye exercise your selues in these things you may hereby be well assured and perswaded of your election and saluation of the third maine question touching distresse of minde and generally of all distresses and their remedies ans omitting all circumstances considering that much might be spoken touching this question i will onely set downe that which i take to be most materiall to the doubt in hand distresse of minde which salomon calls a broken or troubled spirit is when a man is disquieted and distempered in conscience and consequently in his affections touching his estate before god this distresse hath two degrees the lesse and the greater the lesse is a single feare or griefe when a man standeth in suspence and doubt of his owne saluation and in feare that he shall be condemned the greater distresse is despaire when a man is without all hope of saluation in his owne sense and apprehension i call despaire a greater distresse because it is not a distinct kind of trouble of minde as some doe thinke but the highest degree in euery kind of distresse for euery distresse in the minde is a feare of condemnation and comes at length to desperation if it be not cured all distresse of minde ariseth from temptation either begunne or continued for these two doe so necessarily follow and so inseparably accompanie each the other that no distresse of what kinde soeuer can be seuered from temptation and therefore according to the diverse sorts of temptations that doe befall man must the distresses of the minde be distinguished now temptations be of two sorts either of triall or seducement temptations of triall are such as doe befall man for the triall and proofe of the grace of god which is in them the temptations of triall are twofold the first is a combate of the conscience directly and immediately with the wrath of god which beeing the most grieuous temptation that can be it causeth the greatest amp deepest distresse of conscience the second is the triall of the crosse that is of outward affliction whereby god maketh proofe of the faith of his children and not onely that but of their hope patience and affiance in his mercie for their deliuerance temptations of seducement be such as wherin man are entised to fall from god and christ to any kinde of euill and these are of three kinds the first is immediatly from the deuill and it is called the temptation of blasphemies or the blasphemous temptation the second is from a mans owne sinnes originall and actuall and this also hath sundrie branches as we shal see afterward the third proceedes from imagination corrupted and depraued now answerable to these seuerall kinds of temptations are the seuerall kinds of distresses and as all temptations may be reduced to those fiue which haue beene before named so may all distresses be reduced to fiue heads arising of the former temptations before i come to handle them in particular we are to consider in the first place what is the best and most sure generall remedie which may serue for all these or any other kind of temptation that is incident to man and by this the curing of any particular distresse will be more easie and plaine this generall remedie is the applying of the promise of life euerlasting in and by the blood of christ for no physicke no arte or skill of man can cure a wounded and distressed conscience but only the blood of christ and that this is the soueraigne remedie of all other no man doubteth the maine difficultie is touching the manner of proceeding in the application of the promise herein therefore three things must be performed first of all the partie must disclose the cause of the particular distresse that the remedie may the better be applied for the truth is that the very opening of the cause is a great ease to the minde before any remedie be applied yet by the way this care must be had that the thing to be reuealed be not hurtfull to the partie to whome it is made knowne for the distresse may happily arise of some confederacie in matters of treason by the concealing whereof the partie to whome they are reuealed may intangle himselfe in the same danger secondly if the cause may be knowne for sometime it is hid from the partie distressed then triall must be made whether the said partie be fit for comfort yes or no for if he be found to be vnfit the word of god shall be misapplied and consequently abused his fitnesse for comfort may be found out by searching whether he be humbled for his sinnes or not for man may be in great distresse and yet not touched at all for their sinnes this humiliation stands in sorrow for sinne with confession of the same vnto god and in earnest praier for the pardon thereof with an heartie desire of amendment of life but if on the otherside the partie be vnhumbled then the first and principall care must be to worke in him some beginning of humiliation this may be done in a friendly and christian talke and conference whereby he must first be brought to see and well to consider his owne sinnes secondly to grieue and to be sorrie for them at the least for some of the principall and touching this sorrow two things must be remembred first that the nature of worldly sorrow must be altered by beeing turned and changed into sorrow according to god if a man be in some danger of his life by bleeding at the nose experience teacheth the counsell of the physitian is to open a vaine and let the partie blood in the arme that the course thereof may be turned an other way the like order is to be taken with man that are troubled with worldly sorrow in their distresse and that is to turne the course of their griefe by causing them to grieue not for worldly respects or onely in consideration of the punishment due vnto them for their sinnes but principally for the very offence of god in and by their sinnes committed this done a second care must be had that this sorrow for sinne be not confused but a distinct sorrow the man that is in sorrow must not be grieued onely because he is as other man are a sinner but more specially for this and that particular sinne by which it comes to passe that he is such or such a sinner that so his sorrow in respect of sinne may be distinct and brought as it were to some particular head and man in this case must deale with the partie distressed as surgeons are woont to doe with a tumour or swelling in the bodie whose manner is first to applie drawing and ripening plaisters to the place affected to bring the sore to an head that the corruption may issue out at some one place and then afterward healing plaisters which are of great vse to cure the same euen so confused griefe must be reduced to some particulars and then and not before is a man fit for comfort when his conscience is touched in speciall in regard of some one or more distinct and seuerall offences and he that is grieued for one sinne truly and vnfainedly from his heart shall proportionally be grieued for all the sinnes that he knoweth to be in himselfe the third thing required in applying this remedie is the ministring and conuaying of comfort to the minde of him that hath confessed his sinnes and is truly humbled for the and it is a point of the greatest moment of all where if the question be how this comfort should be ministred the answer is it may be done by bringing the partie troubled within the compasse of the promise of life and there be two waies of doing this the one false and the other true some thinke that man may be brought within the couenant by the doctrine of vniuersall grace and redemption but this way of perswading a ma that he hath title in the couenant of grace is both false and vnfit false it is because all the promises of the gospel are limited with the condition of faith and repentance not beeing vniuersall to all but made onely to such persons as repent and beleeue therefore they are indefinite in regard of whole mankind and to beleeuers onely they are vniuersall it is obiected that god would haue all man to be saued ans the apostle is the best expounder of himselfe and he saith in the acts to the same effect the time of this ignorance god regarded not but now he admonisheth all man euery where to repent in which words paul addes this circumstance of time now to limit this good will of god to the last age of the world after the comming of christ in the flesh and not to inlarge the same to all the posteritie of adam and so must he be vnderstood in the place to timothie god would haue all man to be saued that is now in this last age of the world and thus the same apostle corinthian expoundes a certaine prophecie of isay concerning the acceptable time of grace now saith he is the acceptable time behold now is the day of saluation meanig the time of the new testament and coloss the mysterie hid from the beginning is now made manifest to the saints and rom the revelation of the secret mysterie is now opened all which and many other places about the same matter hauing this circumstance of time now must needes be limited to this last age of the world as for the note of vniuersalitie all it must not be vnderstood of all particulars but of all kinds sorts conditions and states of man as may be gathered out of the former words i would that praiers be made for all man not for euery particular man for there be some that sinne vnto death for whome we may not pray but for all states of man as well princes as subiects poore as rich base as noble vnlearned as learned ampc but the saying of paul is vrged corinthian god was in christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe therfore the promise in christ belongs to the whole world and consequently to euery one ans the saine apostle shall againe answer for himselfe rom the casting away of the iewes is thereconciling of the world that is of the gentiles in the last age of the world for so he said before more plainely the falling away of the iew is the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles and so must that place to the corinthes be vnderstood namely not of all and euery man that liued in all ages and times but of them that were by the dispensation of the gospell to be called out of all kingdomes and nation after the death and ascension of christ thus then the promise of saluation is not vniuersall without exception or restraint amp therfore application made by the vniuersalitie of the promise admits some falshood secondly this way of applying is also vnfit for the reason must be framed thus christ died for all man but thou article a man therfore christ died for thee the partie distressed will grant all and say christ indeede died for him if he would haue receiued christ but he by his sinnes hath cut himselfe off from his owne sauiour and hath forsaken him so as the benefit of his death will doe him no good the right way of ministring comfort to a party distressed followeth in the handling whereof first i will lay down the grounds wherby any man that belongs to god may be brought within the couenant and then i will shew the right way how they must be vsed and applied for the first recourse must not be bad to all graces or to all degrees and measures of grace but onely such as a troubled conscience may feele and reach vnto for those that be the true children of god and haue excellent measure of grace when they are in distresse feele little or no grace at all in themselues the graces then that serue for this purpose are three faith repentance and the true loue of god which is the fruit of them both and that we may the more easily and truly discerne of them and not be deceiued inquirie must be made what be the seedes and beginnings of them all the first ground of grace is this a desire to repent and beleeue in a touched heart and conscience is faith and repentance it selfe though not in nature yet in god acceptation i prooue it thus it is a principle graunted and confessed of all man that in them which haue grace god accepteth the will for the deede if there bee a willing minde saith the apostle it is accepted not according to that a man hath not but according to that he hath againe god hath annexed a promise of blessednes and life euerlasting to the true and vnfained desire of grace whence it is that they are in scripture pronounced blessed which hunger and thirst after righteousnes and who are they but such as feele themselues to want all righteousnes and doe truly and earnestly desire it in their hearts for hunger and thirst argues both a want of something and a feeling of the wat and to this purpose the holy ghost saith to him that is a thirst will i giue to drinke of the water of life freely now this thirstie soule is that man which feeles himselfe destitute of all grace and god fauour in christ and withall doth thirst after the blood of christ and desires to be made partaker thereof god is wont mercifully to accept of the desire of any good thing when a man is in necessitie and stands in want therof the lord saies dauid heares the desire of the poore that is of them that are in distresse either of bodie or minde yes he will fulfill the desire of them that feare him it will be said that the desire of good things is naturall and therfore god will not regard mens desires i answer desires be of two sorts some be of such things as man by the meere light of nature know to be good for example the desire of wisdome of ciuill vertue of honour of happinesse and such like and all these nature can desire others be aboue nature as the desire of remission of sinnes reconciliation and sanctification and they which seriously desire these haue a promise of blessednes amp life euerlasting and hence it followes that desire of mercie in the want of mercie is mercie it selfe and desire of grace in the want of grace is grace it selfe a second ground is this a godly sorrow whereby a man is grieued for his sinnes because they are sinnes is the beginning of repentance amp indeed for substance is repentance it selfe the apostle paul reioyced that he had in the worke of his ministerie wrought this godly sorrow in the hearts of the corinthians calling it sorrow that causeth repentance not to be repented of this sorrow may be discerned in this sort the heart of him in whome it is is so affected that though there were no conscience nor deuill to accuse no hell for condemnation yet it would be grieued in it selfe because god by sinne is displeased and offended if it be alleadged that euery one cannot reach to this beginning of repentance thus to sorrow for his sinne then i adde further if the partie be grieued for the hardnes of his heart whereby it comes to passe that he cannot grieue he hath vndoubtedly receiued some portion of godly sorrow for it is not nature that makes vs to grieue for hardnes of heart but grace the third ground is that a setled purpose and willing minde to forsake all sinne and to turn vnto god though as yet no outward conuersion appeare is a good beginning of true conuersion and repentance i thought saith dauid i will confesse against my selfe my wickednes vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne and to this is added selah which is not onely a musicall note but as some thinke a note of obseruation to mooue vs to marke the things that are set downe as beeing of speciall weight and moment and surely this is a matter of great consequence that vpon the very vnfained purpose of confession of sinne god should giue a pardon thereof take a further proofe of this in the prodigall son whome i take not for one that was neuer called or turned to god though some doe so and seeme to haue warrant for their opinion but rather for him that is the child of god and afterward fals away now this man beeing brought by some outward crosses and afflictions to see his owne miserie purposeth with himselfe to returne to his father againe and to humble himselfe and confesse his iniquitie and vpo this very purpose whe he had said i will goe to my father and say vnto him father i haue sinned ampc at his returne a farre off his father receiues him as his child againe and after acceptation followes his confession the like is to be seene in dauid who beeing reprooued by the prophet nathan for his sinnes of adulterie and murther presently made confession of them and at the very same time receiued by the prophet sentence of absolution euen from the lord him elfe wherein he could not erre the fourth ground to loue any man because he is a christian and a child of god is a sensible and certaine note of a man that is partaker of the true loue of god in christ hereby saith s john we knowe that we are translated from death to life because we loue the brother loue here is not a cause but onely a signe of god loue to vs and our sauiour christ saith he that receiueth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receiue a prophets reward nowe that we be not deceiued in these grounds it must be remembred that these beginnings of grace be they neuer so weak must not be littering and fleeting but constant and setled not stopped or staied in the way but such as daily growe and increase and then they are indeed accepted of god and he that can finde these beginnings or any of them truly in himselfe he may assure himselfe thereby that he is the child of god hauing thus laid downe the groundes of comfort i come now to the way by which the party in distresse may be brought within the compasse of the promise of saluation this way standes in two things in making triall and in applying the promise first then triall must be made whether the person distressed haue in him as yet any of the forenamed grouds of grace or not this triall may be made by him that is the comforter in the moouing of certaine questions to the said person and first let him aske whether he beleeue and repent the distressed partie answers no he cannot repent nor beleeue then he must further aske whether he desire to beleeue and repent to this he will answer he doth desire it with all his heart in the same sort is he to make triall of the other groundes when a man is in the fitte of tentation he will say resolutely he is sure to be damned aske him in this fitte of his loue to god he will giue answer he hath none at all but aske him further whether he loue a man because he is a christian and a child of god then will he say he doth indeed thus after triall made in this manner some beginnings of faith and repentance will appeare which at the first lay hid for god vseth out of the time of prosperitie by and in distresse and affliction to work his grace the second point followeth after that by triall some of the foresaid beginnings of grace be found out then comes the right applying of the promise of life euerlasting to the partie distressed and that is done by a kind of reasoning the first part whereof is taken from god word the second from the testimonie of the distressed conscience amp the conclusion is the applying of the promise on this manner he that hath an vnfainod desire to repent and beleeue hath remission of sinnes and life euerlasting but thou hast an earnest desire to repent and beleeue in christ therefore remission of sins and life euerlasting is thine and here remember that it is most conuenient this application be made by the minister of the gospell who in it must vse his ministeriall authority giuen him of god to pronounce the pardon for in distresse it is as hard a thing to make the conscience yeild to the promise as to make fire and water agree for though man haue signes of grace and mercie in them yet will they not acknowledge it by reason of the extremitie of their distresse in this manner vpon any of the former grounds may the troubled and perplexed soule be assured that mercie belongs to it and this i take to be the onely generall and right way of comforting a distressed conscience nowe that the promise thus applyed may haue good successe these sixerules must necessarily be obserued i one is that the comfort which is ministred be alaied with some mixture of the law that is to say the promise alone must not be applyed but withall mention is to be made of the sinnes of the partie and of the grieuous punishmets due vnto him for the same the reason is because there is much guile in the hart of man in so much as oftentimes it falleth out that man not throughly humbled beeing comforted either too soone or too much doe afterward become the worst of all in this respect not vnlike to the iron which beeing cast into the fire vehemently hot and cooled againe is much more hard then it would haue bin if the heate had bin moderate and hence it is that in the ministring of comfort we must somewhat keepe them downe and bring them on by litle and litle to repentance the sweetenesse of comfort is the greater if it be delaied with some artnesse of the law ii an other rule is this if the distressed partie be much possessed with griefe of himselfe he must not be left alone but alwaies attended with good company for it is an vsuall practise of the deuill to take the vantage of the place and time when a man is solitarie and depriued of that helpe which otherwise he might haue in societie with others thus he tempted eue when shee was apart from her husband and in this regard salomon pronounces a woe to him that is alone but herein doth his malice most appeare in that he is alway readiest when a man is in great distresse and withall solitarie then vpon the sudden to tempt him to despaire and to the making away of himselfe iii thirdly the partie in distresse must be taught not to rest vpon his owne iudgement but alwaies to submit himselfe and be content to be aduised by others that are man of wisdome iudgement and discretion a thing to be obserued the rather because the very neglect thereof hath caused sundrie persons to remaine vncomforted for many yeares iv fourthly the partie distressed must neuer heare tell of any fearefull accidents or of any that haue bin in like or worse case then himselfe is for vpon the very report the distressed conscience will fasten the accident vpon it selfe and thereby commonly will be drawne to deeper griefe or despaire the mind afflicted is prone to imagine searefull things and sometime the very bare naming of the deuill will strike terrour and feare into it v fiftly the partie that is to comfort must beare with all the wants of the distressed as with their frowardnes peeuishnes rashnes and with their distempered and disordered affections and actions yes he must put vpon him as it were their persons beeing affected with their miserie and touched with compassion of their sorrowes as if they were his owne grieuing when he seeth them to grieue weeping when they doe weepe and lament vi sixtly he that is the comforter must not be discouraged though after long labour and paines taking there follow small comfort and ease to the partie distressed for man wil often bewray their stiffenes in temptation and vsually it is long before comfort can be receiued and why surely because god hath the greatest stroke in these distresses of minde and brings man thorough all the temptations that he hath appointed euen to the last and vtmost before he opens the heart to receiue comfort the church in the canticles seekes for her beloued but before shee can finde him shee goes about in the citie through the streetes and by open places passing by the watchmen themselues and after shee hath vsed all meanes without helpe or hope at length and not before shee findes her beloued him in whom her soule delighteth thus much for the generall remedie of all distresses now i come to the particular distresses themselues of the first speciall distresse arising of a divine temptation the first distresse ariseth of a divine temptation which is a combate with god himselfe immediatly and this distresse is when the conscience speakes some feareful things of god and withall the partie distressed feeles some euident tokens of god wrath examples hereof we shall finde many in the word of god one is the example of righteous iob who hauing beene long in outward afflictions was withall exercised with the apprehension of the anger of god and in that state he saith that the arrowes of the almightie were in him that the venime thereof did drinke vp his spirit that the terrours of god did fight against him yes further he addeth that god was his enemie and writ bitter things against him and made him to possesse the sinnes of his youth and at an other time he complaineth that god wrath had torne him that he hated him gnashed vpon him with his teeth and had sharpened his eyes against him yes that he had taken him by the necke and beaten him and set him as a marke for himselfe in all which and diverse other places it appeares that his conscience was exercised with the sense of the wrath of god which had now euen seazed vpon his soule another example we haue in dauid who also was exercised with this temptation and trouble of minde as the first words of the psalme and the whole tenour thereof doe euidently shew for first he desires the lord not to rebuke him in his wrath and afterward complaineth that his griefe was so great that his very flesh consumed his bones were vexed and his bodie brought to such a state as no sicknesse could haue brought him vnto and it is not vnlike that the same prophet did often fall into the like kind of distresse of minde as may be gathered out of psalme and sundrie other places now as it fared with these and diverse other servant of god in ancient times so are we not without some instances thereof in our daies amongst many that worthie man master luther writes of himselfe that he was in this particular temptation and that he learned in it the doctrine of the iustification of a sinner by the meere mercie of god without any merit of workes and vpon the sense and experience of the nature and properties of this distresse he wrote a notable exposition of the psalme of dauid the scope and intent whereof he writeth to be nothing els but a soueraigne remedie of this and the like distresses of the minde and conscience if it be demaunded what is the occasion of this kind of temptation i answer that it ariseth sometimes vpon the commission of some notorious sinne which doth wound the conscience as in cain iudas and saul who for their great and capitall sinnes that stinged and wounded their consciences grew to a fearefull state and consequently perished in this temptation sometimes againe it comes when there is no sinne committed but obedience to god performed and then there cannot be rendered any reason of it either in man or out of man saue this that god will haue it so to be and the truth hereof is plaine by the examples of iob and dauid before mentioned the effects of this temptation are many and very strange for outwardly it workes a change and alteration in the body as it were a burning ague and it causeth the entralls to rise the liuer to rowle in the bodie and it sets a great heat in the bones and consumes the flesh more then any sicknes can doe and that it is so as i say beside experience it is cleare in the word of god dauid in this distresse affirmeth that his eyes were eaten as it were with wormes and sunke into his head psalm that his moisture became as the drought in sommer psalm and iob saies that his skin was blacke vpon him his bones were burnt with heat yes that by meanes of this distresse he was now full of wrinkles and his leanenes did rise vpon him it is a principle which physitians doe hold that the minde followes the temperature of the bodie and is affected according to the good or euill constitution thereof which though it be true yet withall it is as manifest on the other side that the bodie doth often follow the state and condition of the minde for a distressed heart must of necessitie make a fainting and a languishing bodie but the principall thing to be sought for in this temptation is the remedie thereof whereunto there be fiue things required which are to be practised as occasion shall be offered first choise must be made of the most fitte and present remedie and that must be vsed in the first place now the most fit and present remedie is to bring the partie troubled to the personall exercises of faith and repentance by and in himselfe for this ende he must examine his conscience most straightly and narrowly of all the sinnes of his heart and life secondly he must humbly confesse against himselfe all his knowne sinnes and withall acknowledge the due condemnation that he thereby hath deserued thirdly he must crie to heauen for mercie intreating the lord most instantly for pardon and for the restraint of his wrath due vnto him for his sinne dauid beeing in this distresse performed all these duties as we may read in the psalme and he saith further of himselfe that whilst he concealed his sinnes the hand of god was heauie vpon him but vpon his earnest confession and deprecation he receiued mercie and if we read the booke of iob we shall finde that the principall scope thereof is this namely to shew vnto vs that iob was throughly exercised with this temptation and that in the ende hauing beene rebuked both by his friends and by god himselfe his recouerie was made by humbling himselfe when he saith behold i am vile againe now i abhorre my selfe and repent in dust and ashes some may here demand if it fall out that the person himselfe cannot performe any good dutie of himselfe by reason of his distraction in soule and bodie what must then be done ans if the partie can but sigh and sobbe vnto god for mercie and comfort it is no doubt a worke of god spirit and a practise both of faith and repentance we know not saith saint paul what to pray as we ought namely in our distresses but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes that cannot be expressed and therein lies our comfort thus moses at the redde sea beeing in great distresse and not knowing what to say or doe sighed and groned inwardly in his soule vnto the lord for helpe and protection and his very desire was in stead of a loud crie in the eares of the lord the second thing is that triall must be made whether the partie hath in him any tokens of grace or not these tokens are the small beginnings of grace which before i haue declared as for example a griefe because we cannot grieue for sinne as we should a serious will and desire to beleeue and repent a purpose to sin no more and such like if these be found in the partie then by them as by sure pledges he may bee assured of the fauour of god towards him and where any of these be found the saying of god to saint paul must be vrged my grace is sufficient for thee and therewith must the distressed partie stay his minde yes we are to be content with any condition in this life be it neuer so miserable so long as we are in the fauour of god though he should lay vpon vs euen the paines of hell till the time of our death so did dauid who when he was pursued by his owne son vttered these words vnto god behold if i please thee not do with me what thou wilt and the like was the mind of paul who being assured of the fauour of god was content for his glorie amp the saluation of the israelits if it had beene possible to be separated christ and to indure the very pangs of hell the third thing in this cure is to applie to the said distressed partie such promises of god made vnto afflicted persons as are most large and comfortable for example that the lord is neere to them that are of a contrite heart and will saue such as be afflicted in spirit psalm againe i came not saith our sauiour christ but to the lost sheepe of the house of israel matth he saies not to the straying sheepe but to such as are now in the pitte readie to be drowned or in the lyons mouth readie to be deuoured againe the spirit of the lord is vpon me therefore he hath annointed me that i should preach the gospell to the poore that is to such as are distressed in consciece and poore in spirit he hath sent me that i should heale the broken hearted that i should preach deliuerance to the captiues these amp many other such like promises are in this case to be vrged and the partie mooued to endeauour to beleeue them to hold to them and rest himselfe vpon them though he loose all things els fourthly the partie must be brought to a serious consideration of his owne life past and of god mercifull dealing with him amp others in his case in former times and therwith is he to be comforted for the time present for if aforehand he hath receiued any tokens of the fauour and loue of god by them he is now to stay and to settle his minde the reason is plaine the gifts of god are without repentace whom he loueth once he loueth to the ende amp whom he chooseth he calleth iustifieth and sanctifieth and will also in time glorifie dauid beeing in such affliction that he could hardly thinke vpon god yet he tooke this course praied to the lord for comfort communed with his owne heart and called to remembrance how god had formerly dealt with him and with this meditation of the continuall course of god mercie in his preseruation he confirmed his faith and staied his heart in his greatest troubles the fifth and last thing to be done is the remooueall of such reasons and doubts as the partie distressed vsually makes against himselfe for his owne ouerthrow for it is the manner of those that are troubled in minde to dispute against themselues and commoly they are woont to alleadge three things first beeing instructed how to humble themselues and to depend on god mercie they will graunt that all these indeede are good things but they belong not to them for they neither do nor can feele any thing but the tokens of god anger and that they are alreadie entred into some degrees of condemnation this obiection may be taken away by informing them of the manner of god dealing in all his workes for commonly he workes all things in his creatures in and by cotraries if we could know the whole frame of them thus in the creation euery creature had his beeing of that which had no beeing and something was made not of something but of nothing after the flood the signe of god coueuant for the preseruation of the world from destruction by raine is the rainbow which indeed is a naturall signe of raine when elijah was to prooue the lord to be the onely true god against the idolatrous priests of baal and that by burnt offerings he powred water vpon the sacrifice amp fills a trench with water round about and in this contrarie means was the sacrifice burnt vp christ for the curing of a blind man tepers spittle and clay together which in all reason is a fitter meanes to put out the eyes then to cause the blind to see thus in the worke of our redemption christ giues life not by life but by death and he sendes man to heauen by the gates and suburbs of hell he shewes his greatest power in the greatest weaknes nay his power is made perfect through weakenes he will not build vpon an old foundation but he pulls downe and destroies all that man may haue no hope at all in himselfe but that all the hope he hath may be in god first he kils and then he makes aliue as anna speaketh first he woundeth and then he healeth he makes man to sowe in teares that afterward he may reape in ioy and he that knowes god dealing to be this must herewith rest content and satisfied because in wrath god vseth to remember his mercy yes his mercie is neuer sweete vnto the palate of the soule vntill it be seasoned with some tast of his wrath the paschall lambe was eaten with sowre hearbs to signifie that we can feele no sweetenes in the blood of christ till wee first feele the smart of our owne sinnes and corruptions secondly these persons vse to alleadge against themselues that if they could feele any comfort at al then they would stay their minds and yeild to good perswasions and exhortations to this the answer is that there is a rule of grace which we must follow gathered out of the word of god and the experience of god children contrarie to the rule of nature and aboue the light of reason and it is this that in case of a liction we must not liue by feeling but by faith this rule is grounded vpon the speech of the lord by the prophet the iust ma shall liue by his faith when we haue neither sight nor sense nor any tast of god mercie but onely apprehend his wrath euen then we must labour to lay hold of mercie in his word and promise sense amp feeling are not alwaies fit directios for the time of this life for he may be the deare child of god that in present feeleth nothing but his wrath and indignation this indeede is the true triail of our faith when euen aboue and against reason we relie on the mercie of god in the apprehension of his anger so did dauid out of the deepe saith he that is beeing nowe deepely plunged into the pangs of a distressed conscience haue i called vpo thee o lord and iob in the like case lord though thou kill me yet will i trust in thee abraham is commended by the holy ghost amongst other things for this that he beleeued in god aboue hope that is against all matter of hope that might possibly be conceiued vpon the consideration of the strength of natural causes the thiefe vpon the crosse feeling nothing but woe and seeing nothing in christ but misery and contempt yet he beleeued in christ and was saued in a word christ himselfe when he was sorsaken of all man and voide of all wordly comfort and felt nothing but the depth of the wrath god in his agony and passion yet by the faith of his manhood hestaied himselfe and said my god my god thirdly they vse to plead that their case is desperate that neuer any was in such a state as they are neuer any touched with the like distresse of mind answer it is false for the holy ghost hath penned three notable places of scripture the booke of iob and two psalmes of dauid wherein are propounded vnto vs the examples of iob and dauid god owne deare servant who were in as great distresse as euer they or any other haue beene and they may not thinke that they euer could be able to indure greater paines then christ who notwithstanding in the anguish of his soule vpon the crosse cried out my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and thus much touching the first kind of trouble of conscience called the diuine temptation of the second speciall distresse arisi g from outward afflictions the second kind of distresse is that which ariseth from outward afflictions by afflictions i vnderstand all manner of miseries and calamities in this life from the least to the greatest from the paine of the little finger to the very pangs of death nowe the question is howe the trouble of minde arising by afflictions may be remedied for the answer of which question two things are required of the partie distressed practise and meditation the practise is that which is to be vsed in all distresses of minde what soeuer and it is a diligent examination of the conscience in regard of sinne an earnest and heartie confession thereof vnto god and deprecation that is earnest praier vnto him for the pardon of the same these three things beeing done truly and vnfainedly from the heart are a present remedie against this trouble and bring with them much comfort manasses the king of iudah that had comitted much wickednesse when he was carried captiue to babel and there put in chaines he humbled himselfe acknowledged his sinnes and praied earnestly vnto the lord and the issue was good for god was intreated of him and gaue him deliuerance iob beeing long in outward affliction humbled himselfe in like manner and at length receiued comfort daniel humbled himselfe before god for his owne sinnes and for the sinnes of god people making request vnto god earnestly for them and euen when he was in the acte of praying the lord sent his angel gabriel to giue him notice of deliuerance lastly the church of god vnder the crosse performed the like dutie let vs search and trie our waies and turne to the lord and god in mercie gaue an eare vnto her mourning and lamentation by all these places it is apparent that there is no better remedie in the world for the minde of man grieued by meanes of outward afflictions then the practise of the duties before named the next thing vnto practise is the meditation of the comfortable doctrines that are set downe in the word of god touching afflictions all which doctrines may be reduced to fiue principall and maine grounds of comfort and shall be laid downe in their order the first ground is that all afflictions from the least to the greatest doe come to passe not by accident chaunce or fortune but by the speciall prouidence of god i explaine it thus in euery particular crosse and affliction there is the hand of god particular prouidence and that in three regards first because god decreeth and foreappointeth euery particular crosse marke the words of paul whome god hath foreknowne them he hath predestinate to be made like vnto the image of his s ne and what is this image nothing else but a conformitie vnto christ in afflictions for this life and in glorie for the life to come now if god hath decreed that those whome he foreknew should be conformable vnto his son in these respects then hath he also decreed the afflictions themselues secondly god doth not onely barely permit afflictions to be but also he effecteth them and brings them into execution as they are crosses corrections trialls and punishments i make peace saith the lord and i create euill that is not the euill of sinne but of punishment which is euill in our sense and feeling for things are tearmed euill two waies some are euill indeed some are euill not indeed but in regard of our sense apprehension and estimation and of this latter sort are afflictions which god is said to create and to this purpose is the saying of the prophet amos shall there be euill in the citie and the lord hath not done it thirdly as god causeth afflictions so he ordereth and disposeth them that is he limiteth and appointeth the beginning the end the measure or quantitie and the continuance thereof yes he also ordereth them to their right endes namely his owne glorie the good of his servant and the benefit of his church thus god is saide to correct his people in iudgement that is so as he will haue the whole ordering of the correction in his owne hand ioseph tells his brother that when they intended euill against him in selling him to the ishmaelites for siluer god disposed it for good when shemei cursed dauid he forbade his servant so much as to meddle with him and why because saith he the lord bade him to curse and who then dare say onto him why hast thou done so and to this purpose the prophet dauid saith i held my peace and said nothing why because thou lord hast done it psalm here some wil say if afflictions did come onely from god it were somewhat but of ent es they come from man that beare vs no good will and therefore no maruell though we be impatient answer when crosses doe come from man god vseth them as instruments to execute his iudgements vpon vs and in this worke god is the chiefe doer and they are as tooles in the hand of the workman and the lord inflicteth them vpon vs by man to trie our patience vnder the crosse ioseph though he knew well the badde dealing of his brother towards him yet he looked not to them alone but to an higher cause namely the lord himselfe who executed his owne good will by them god faith he disposed it to good and againe god did send me before you into egypt for your preseruation the second ground is the commandement of god touching the crosse and obedience vnto him therein this commaundement is expressed luke where we are commanded to take vp our crosse euery day and follow christ abraham was commanded with his owne hands to sacrifice his onely son isaac and to this commandement though otherwise a great crosse vnto him he addresseth himselfe to yeeld obedience and in the prophecie of micah the church saith shee will boare the wrath of the lord that is shee will performe obedience to him in the crosse because shee had sinned against him and saint peter saith that god resisteth the proud and giueth grace to the humble therefore humble your selues vnder the mightie hand of god and this beeing the commaundement of god that we should yeeld obedience to him in euery affliction we ought to be no lesse carefull to obey it then any one commandement of the morall law the third ground is that god will be present with his servant in their afflictions vpon this ground dauid comforts himselfe because god had promised to heare him to be with him in trouble and to deliuer him and in an other place though i should walke in the shaddow of death i would feare none ill for thou article with me ampc now that we may the better vnderstand this doctrine we are to consider what be the ends or effects of god beeing with vs in affliction whereby he testifieth his presence and they are three the first is to worke our deliuerance from the crosse call vpon me saith the lord in the time of thy trouble and i will deliuer thee this promise must not be vnderstood simply but with an exception so farre forth as it shall be for our good for all promises of temporall deliuerance are conditionall and must be conceiued with this limitation of the crosse and chastisement if god please to impose it some may say how if god will not deliuer vs but leaue vs in the affliction what cofort shall we then haue answer in the second place therefore we must remember that god will temper and moderate our afflictions so as we may be able to beare them habbakuk praieth vnto god in the behalfe of the church that he would in wrath remember mercie and paul saith that the lord will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able to beare but will giue an issue with the temptation thirdly put the case that god doth not moderate our afflictions but suffer them to remaine vpon vs not onely for some time of our life but to the very death yet then will he testifie his holy presence an other way namely by giuing the partie distressed power and strength to beare his affliction vnto you it is giuen saith paul for christ that not onely ye should beleeue in him but also suffer for his sake the fourth ground of comfort in affliction is that euery affliction vpon the servant of god hath some speciall goodnesse in it rom we know that all things worke together for good vnto them that loue god and in regard hereof the crosses which are indured by god children are so farre from beeing preiudiciall to their saluation that they are rather helps and furtherances of the same now this goodnes is perceiued two waies first by the fruit and effect of it and then by the qualitie and condition thereof in both which respects afflictions are good touching the fruits of afflictions because they are manifold i will reduce them to seauen principall heads i afflictions doe make man to see and consider their sinnes iosephs brother for twentie yeares together were little or not at all troubled for their wickednes in selling their brother yet vpon their affliction in egypt they began to consider what they had done we haue say they verily sinned against our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soule when he besought vs and we would not heare him therefore is this trouble come vpon vs manasses in the time of his peace gaue himselfe to witchcraft and the worshipping of straunge god but when he was captiue in babylon then was he brought to the sight of his sinnes amp mooued to humble himselfe before god for them ii afflictions serue to humble man in their soules before god the young vnthrift in the gospel called the prodigall childe while his portion lasted he spent liberally and was grieued for nothing but when he came to be pinched with hunger and that through his owne follie then he humbled himselfe before his father amp returned home vnto him dauid saith of himselfe that in his prosperi te be thought he should neuer be mooued because the lord of his goodnesse had made his mountaine to stand strong but saith he thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled then cried i vnto the lord iii they serue to worke amendment of life no chastising saith the author to the hebrewes for the present seemeth to be ioyous but afterward it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse to them that are thereby exercised that is afflictions and chastisments that seaze vpon god children doe leaue after them amendment of life as the needle passeth thorough the cloath and leaueth the threed behinde it when we are iudged saith the apostle we are nurtered of the lord that we might not be condemned with the world and dauid confesseth psalm it is good for me that i haue beene afflicted that i might learne thy statutes and the good husbandman purgeth and pruneth the vine that it may bring forth more and better fruit iiii they cause man to denie themselues and to relie wholly on the mercie of god thus paul receiued the sentence of death in himselfe that he should not trust in himselfe but in god that raiseth the dead v the fift is invocation for afflictions make vs to crie heartily and feruently vnto god to bring our selues into his presence and there to abase our selues before him thus the lord said of the olde israelites that when he slew them then they returned amp sought him earely psalm and els where he saith of his children that in their affliction they will seeke him diligently vi the sixth is patience affliction bringeth forth patience patience experience ampc as if he should say because the loue of god is shed in our hearts therefore in afflictions we are patient now whilst we patiently heare the crosse we haue experience of the mercie and loue of god towards vs and hauing once in some notable deliuerance tried and tasted the mercie of god we doe by hope as it were promise to our selues the saide fauour and mercie for time to come vii the last fruit is obedience this the holy ghost teacheth to haue beene the fruit of the suffering of christ when he saith though he were the son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered in the next place afflictions are good in regard of their qualitie and condition which is that they are tokens and pledges of our adoption when we make the best vse of them if ye indure chastening saith the holy ghost god offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes that is he comes to you in the crosse not as a iudge and reuenger but as a kind and louing father and the crosse imposed is as it were his fatherly hand wherewith the chastiseth vs and therefore iob praiseth god for his affliction saying god hath giuen and god hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord the fifth ground of comfort is that the partie distressed hath partners in the crosse for first he hath christ to be his partner because he hath fellowship with him in that he is afflicted and is willing to obey god therein paul accounteth it happines to knowe the fellowship of christs afflictions and to be made conformable vnto his death philipp and saint peter exhorteth beleeuers to reioyce in as much as they are partakers of christes sufferings pet secondly if the partie afflicted repent christ communicateth with him in al his crosses amp accounts them as his owne the apostle in this regard would haue no man thinke it strange no not when he is in the fierie triall but rather to reioyce because he is partaker of christs sufferings pet and christ saith to saul persecuting his church saul saul why persecutest thou me thirdly he that is afflicted hath other servant of god partakers with him in all his afflictions the apostle peter wisheth the church of god to resist sathan by faith knowing saith he that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothren that are in the world pet thus much generally of afflictions and of comfort in them it were a long and tedious worke to set all downe in particular together with their proper and distinct comforts therefore i will passe them ouer and speake only of three kinds of afflictions with their remedies the first is the deferring of deliuerance a great afflictio if it be considered and touching it i propound one question namely how the minde of the partie distressed may be staied when as the lord deferres deliuerance for the answer hereof three especiall points are to be considered i first that god hath in his wisdome set downe certen and unchangeable times for the accomplishment and issue of all things that are ther is a time appointed to euery thing vnder the sun eccl the speech of salomon is generall and the meaning of it is this whatsoeuer there is in the world either done or suffered or enioyed by man whether it be of the number of naturall things or of those which are voluntarily vndertaken or necessarily endured god hath in his prouidence sorted vnto them a set time and season whereof dependeth the successe of them all and this time himselfe most freely ordereth and ruleth at his owne good pleasure which as no ma can hinder or stay so is it not in the power of any to hasten or preuet this point the holy ghost in scripture prooueth by two instances of the threatnings and promises of god which himselfe accomplisheth at some certaine and vnchangeable times when the old world in the daies of noah had growne to much impietie and wickednes the lord appointed a certaine space of yeares for their repentance and conuersion at the very ende and tearme whereof he brought the flood vpon them and not before for if we compare the particular circumstances of time noted in the of genesis with that which s peter writeth pet ee shall find that the inundation of water came vpon the earth at the very point of time before determined againe god threatned by ieremie that the iewes for their sins should be led captiue and serue the king of babel yeares now if we take the iust computation of time it will appeare that so soone as euer those yeres were expired the foresaid threat was accomplished and therefore daniel alluding to ieremies prophecie exactly setteth it downe when he saith the same night was belshazzarking of the chaldeans slaine that is the very night wherein those yeares came to their full period and as there are set times allotted by god for the execution of his threatning senteces so also hath he determined certenly the accomplishment of all and euery of his promises an example hereof we haue in the israelites of whom the lord said to abraha that they should be in affliction in a strange land yeres and then be deliuered this promise of god was expressely fulfilled as we read in the booke of exodus for before the ende and tearme of these yeares they had no deliuerance at all but when that time was expired euen that selfe same day departed all the hosts of israel out of the land of egypt and though moses fourtie yeares before this time tooke in hand the worke of their deliuerance yet he did it without successe and vpon a certaine accident beeing himselfe constrained to flie into madian he liued there as a stranger with iethro his father in law till the saide time of foure hundred and thirtie yeares was accomplished toward the ende whereof being called of god to that office he prospered and not before and in the same manner hath god set downe a certaine period of time within which he will exercise his children more or lesse and at the end wherof and not before he will releeue and comfort them againe now as the certentie of the accomplishment of god threatning word serues to terrifie all wicked liuers from sinne so the vnchangeable performance of his promises at the very time prefixed amp not before teacheth the children of god sundrie things first that when they are in any distresse amp haue not present or speedie deliuerance according to their desire they should waite the lord leisure and expect with patience till the time come which is appointed by him for their ease and releefe and in the meane while stay their hearts by hope and affiance in his mercie reason is plaine god is sure in his word therefore though heauines may indure for a night yet ioy will returne in the morning psalm thus the lord comforteth the iewes in a particular distresse as we may read in the prophecie of habbakuk where the prophet in the name of the iewes complaineth and expostulateth the matter with god why his owne people should be so lamentably afflicted by a terrible and furious nation and why they should be led away captiues by the chaldeans the enemy of god to this the lord makes answer that as he had certenly determined that iudgemet to come vpon them so certenly had he appointed a set time wherein they should be deliuered in the meane while he bids them to comfort themselues in this that though the affliction should rest vpon them for a season yet vndoubtedly they should be eased at the length and therefore that they should in patience waite for the vision that is the accoplishment of the vision touching their deliuerance secondly hence we learne that we must not onely beleeue the promises of god in generall that god is true and faithfull in them and that he is able amp willing to fulfil them euen as he made them but we must beleeue them in particular that is with application to their proper and seuerall circumstances which are the particular meanes places and times whereby and wherein he hath giuen his word as touching our freedome and exemption from the crosse take an instance hereof in the prophet daniel who knew well by the spirit of prophecie that the lord had determined to bring vpon the iewes yeares captiuitie in babylon he knew also that god had promised to put an ende to that captiuitie at the end and tearme of those yeares now what did daniel in this case vpon knowledge of the will of god in that point during the said time he praied not vnto the lord for deliuerance of his people but when he vnderstood that the time drewe neere wherin it was the wil of god that the iewes should returne out of captiuitie then by faith applying the promise of god to that particular time he besought the lord in praier and supplications with fasting in sackcloth and ashes and the lord gaue eare vnto his praiers and yeelded him a gratious answer ii the second point is that god when he deferres deliuerance doth it vpon great and weightie causes and considerations best knowne to himselfe the first wherof is that thereby he might humble man throughly and bring them to an vtter deniall of themselues and consequently cause them to learne patience in affliction which they would not learne if they might be their owne caruers and haue speedy deliuerance from the crosse at their own wills and pleasures secondly that beeing afflicted they may acknowledge whence their deliuerance comes yes whence they doe receiue not onely that but euery other good benefit which they inioy namely not from theselues or any creature but onely from the lord and accordingly may learne to value and prize his gifts at their deserued excellencie for it is a true saying and often verified in affliction amp want that benefits easily obtained are lightly regarded and sooner forgotten thirdly that by the continuance of the crosse without intermission he may make them to distaste the world and consequently drawe them to the meditation of the life to come wherein all matter of mourning shall cease and all teares shall be wiped from their eies fourthly the lord de erreth deliuerance from affliction that he might preuent greater euils and dangers whereinto those that are afflicted might runne if they had their heartes desire and were eased not at his will but at their owne wishes when the childre of israel came into canaan they were informed that they should dwell together with the canaanites and moses rendreth a reason thereof least saith he the wild beast of the field multiply against thee and for the preuenting of this euill the israelites must indure some annoyance by the canaanites euen so the lord keepeth his servant vnder the crosse for the preuenting of greater sins amp offences this should stay the mindes of man amp make them content to wait vpon god for deliuerance when they are afflicted iii the third and last point is that god alwaies hath and doth exercise his best servant with long and continued crosses abraham was childlesse till he was yeares of age and at those yeares the lord promised him issue but this promise was not accoplished til a long time after when he was an hundred yeares old dauid had a promise to be king of ierusalem and iuda but the lord exercised him by many and grieuous afflictions before he came to the crowne in so much that he saies of himselfe that his eies failed with waiting vpon his god zachary amp elizabeth praied to god both of the in their youth amp many yeares after for issue but the lord granted not their request til they were olde to adde no more examples by these we see the lord dealing euen with holy man and woman his owne deare servant that he doth not alwaies grant their requests nor condescend to their desires at the first but as it were holds them off and suspends his grace and fauour for a time and therefore if it shall please him thus to deale with any of vs we must from these examples be taught to possesse our soules with patience resting contented in his will and waiting on his good pleasure to the ende to conclude this point suppose that the condition of god servant be such as that they finde no ende of their afflictions but that they doe continue euen vnto death what shall they doe in this case ans besides that which hath beene said before for the resolution of this question i answer further that first they must still euen vnto death liue by faith and say with holy iob lord though thou kill me yet will i trust in thee secondly they must stay and releeue their soules in the meane time with these and such like meditations i that it is the will and pleasure of god that we should through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of god act now it is the propertie of a true child of god to rest content in his fathers good will and pleasure euen when he is afflicted prov my sonnebe not grieued at my correction that is let it not be tedious vnto thee be content to beare it our dutie therefore is meekely to subiect our selues vnto the hand of god as the child doth vnto the correction of his father ii that though afflictions be long and tedious yet god will at length giue a ioyfull and comfortable issue for so himselfe hath promised math blessed are they that mourne for they shall be comforted psalm great are the troubles of the righteous but the lord wil deliuer him out of them all psalm marke the vpright man and behold the iust for the ende of that man is peace iii afflictions be they neuer so heauie in regard of continuance yet they are in no sort comparable to those eternall ioyes that god hath prepared for them that loue him this was pauls meditation who indured the crosse euen to his dying day our light affliction saith he which is but for a moment worketh vnto vs an excellent and eternall waight of glorie and else where he professeth that he did not count the afflictions of this present time answerable in value to the glorie which shall be reuealed vnto god children rom saint peter tells them to whome he wrote that in regard of their assured hope of eternall life they should reioyce though now for a season they were in heauines through manifold tentations pet lastly the author to the hebrewes comforteth the church by this reason because it is yet a very little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarrie iv though god withholdeth his hand in respect of deliuerance euen to death yet his loue is constant and vnchangeable and the crosse which we vndergoe cannot separate vs from that loue wherewith he hath loued vs in iesus christ rom and thus much of the first particular distresse of minde arising of outward afflictions the second particular distres is bodily and temporarie death which consisteth in the separation of the soule from the bodie and touching this affliction it is demanded how any servant of god may be able to indure with comfort the pangs of death for the answer hereof two things are required a preparation to death and helps in the time of death concerning preparation there are three duties to be performed the first and most principall is commended vnto vs in the booke of psalmes where dauid praies vnto god lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my daies and moses in like manner lord teach me to number my daies that i may applie my heart vnto wisdome in which places is remembred a notable dutie of preparation to wit that a man should resolue himselfe of death continually and before hand number his daies this is done by esteeming of euery day as the day of his death and accordingly doing alwaies that which he would doe if he were now to giue vp the ghost secondly in way of preparation we must endeauour to disarme and weaken death who is as an armed man that hath his weapons whereby he seekes to destroy vs and in this case we must deale with death as the philistims dealt with sampson they saw by experience that he was a mightie man and by his power and strength had giuen them many foyles and therefore they laboured to know in what part of his bodie his strength did lie and after inquirie finding it to be in the haire of his head they neuer rested till they had spoiled him thereof and questionlesse the time will come when we all must encounter with this strong amp powerfull sampson death in the meane while it is a point of wisdome to inquire wherein his power and might consisteth when this search hath bin made we shall finde that his weapons are our manifold sinnes and corruptions both of heart and life for as paul saith the sting of death is sinne therefore that we may spoile him of this his furniture we must exercise our selues in the practise of two duties first vse all meanes for the cutting off of the locke of our sinnes whereby alone satan hath the vantage of vs and these means are the duties of humiliation inuocation and true repentance we must therefore humble our selues before god be instant in praier for the pardon of our sinnes past and present and in this point giue the lord no rest vntill we haue obtained in our consciences the sweet certificate of his fauour and mercie in christ whereby our mindes may be staied and comforted this done it stands vs in hand to turne vnto god to be carefull to leaue sinne to entertaine in our hearts a resolued purpose and intention of new obedience and conformitie to the will and commandement of god in all things and this is the onely way in the world to bereaue this our enemie of his armour to pull the sting out of the mouth of this serpent and consequently euen in death to pruaile against him thirdly in way of preparation our dutie is euen before hand while we liue in this world to indeauour to haue some true taste of life euerlasting and the ioyes of heauen the due consideration whereof will be of great vse for it will stirre vp in our hearts a desire and loue of perfect happines in heauen yes a feruent expectation of christs comming to iudgement and it will further cause vs to say with simeon lord now let thy servant depart in peace and with the apostle i desire to be dissolued and be with christ touching this spirituall ioy and comfort in the holy ghost these questions of conscience are mooued i first how may we in this life haue and nourish in our hearts a true tast of eternall happinesse and of the ioyes of the world to come ans first by a serious consideration of the euills that doe hinder or preiudice our happines and they are principally foure one is the miserie of our liues in respect of sinne and the consequents thereof for there is no man in the world be he neuer so righteous that can truly say of himselfe i am cleane from my sinne prov yes uen the regenerate that haue receiued grace to beleeue to turne vnto god and to liue according to the spirit doe finde by experience corruption amp rebellion in their minds wills and affections which daily affordeth matter of sinning against god and on the otherside hindreth and quencheth all the good motions of the spirit that are in them againe such is the irreconciliable malice of satan that he takes vantage of mans corruption and neglectes no time or opportunitie to intrappeth children of god in the snares of his temptations and hence it is that man by reason of his owne corruption and the wicked suggestions of the deuill is at continuall strife with himselfe hath daily occasion of sorrow worketh out his saluation with feare and trembling wading as it were euen while he liueth in a sea of many miseries the second euill is the vanitie of all things that are in the world for whether we consider the world it selfe or the things therein contained done or suffered there is nothing so sure and steadie whereunto man hauing attained can possibly rest fully satisfied and contented or which in the ende will not prooue to be most vaine vanitie and the truth hereof appeareth in the experience of salomon himselfe who beeing king ouer israel wanted neither authoritie nor abilitie and opportunitie to take knowledge and triall of all worldly things in all estates and conditions and hauing euen of set purpose carefully and earnestly searched into them all at length he concludes that the issue of all was vnprofitable vanitie and vexation o minde as we may read in his ecclesiastes the third euill is the changeable condition of our life in this world whereby it comes to passe that we are alway in a fleeting and transitorie state for we are as saint peter speaketh but strangers and pilgrimes that wander to and fro in the earth as in a strange countrey and still are making forward to our owne home we haue here no abiding citie the houses wherein we dwell are but innes in which we sojourne for a time yes the body which we haue are but ents and abernacles alway readie to be shifted and our selues to be translated into another place fourthly by remembring that christ our head beeing now in heauen and we his members vpon the earth during our life we are in presence separated from our head and consequently from that happie and glorious fellowship which we shall inioy with him and all the saints our fellow members in the kingdome of heauen this s paul noteth when he saith whilst we are at home in the bodie we are absent from the lord and thereupon himselfe desired to be dissolued and to be with christ hauing thus entred into the due consideration of the aforesaid euills we must in the second place exercise our selues in the frequent meditation of the blessed estate of god chosen in the kingdome of glorie who beeing translated out of this life into the bosome of abraham are fully and perfectly freed from sinne from satan from vanitie and miserie haue all teares wiped from their eyes doe behold the face of god are made like vnto christ in holines and honour and doe with him inherit the kingdome prepared for them from the foundations of the world in the third place hauing throughly considered of these things we must compare the estate of this present life in the respects before amed with the estate of that which is to come in the kingdome of heauen and laying them in a paralell together we shall sinde the one infinitely farre to excell the other in regard of true ioy and comfort and this will make vs though liuing in the world yet to vse it as if we vsed it not to haue our conversation in heauen to thinke with paul that to be loosed and be with christ is best of all for vs to haue a true and liuely tast of the ioyes of the world to come and accordingly with abraham isaac and iacob to looke for a citie that hath foundations whose builder and maker is god ii secondly it is demanded how a man may truly discerne whether this ioy of the spirit be in him yes or no for answer hereunto it is to be remembred that there are sundrie properties wherby it differeth from carnall ioy and these are principally fiue first this ioy is brought forth as it were of sorrow for sinne and for the want of christ ye shal sorrow saith our sauiour christ to his disciples meaning for his departure but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy these words are not onely meant of his disciples but of all beleeuers who vpon consideration of their sinnes and the spirituall want of christ iesus doe mourn and lament for not onely they but all true beleeuers are there opposed vnto the world againe blessed are they that mourne that is being touched with causes of exceeding griefe doe withall mourn for their sinnes for they shal be comforted on the other side carnal ioy as it hath his beginning from the flesh amp ariseth of things pleasing thereunto so it ends in sorrow and heauinesse in the end reioycing is turned into mourning saith solomon and woe e to you that now laugh for ye shall weepe secondly the ioy of the spirit is a fruit of righteousnes that is it issueth and floweth from christ knowne and beleeued to be made vnto vs of god wisdome righteousnes sanctification and full redemption for from hence followes peace of conscience and from peace comes ioy in the holy ghost contrariwise the ioy of the flesh ariseth only from the sudden feeling of some worldly delight and therfore cannot bring any sound peace vnto the conscience of the man possessed of it thirdly spirituall ioy is founded in the holy vse of the word sacraments and praier and in the practise of christian duties of mercie oue iustice ampc the other is not so for the world conceiueth a ioy besides the word o of the exercises of inuocation and repentance which stands in the practise of crueltie malice oppression iniustice and all manner of impietie and hence it is that hauing spet their daies in such matter of reioycing at length in a momet they go down to hell fourthly heauenly ioy is so fixed amp rooted in the heart that it cannot be remooued thence your ioy shal no man take from you saith christ it must needes therefore be true and sound yes able to swallow vp all matter of griefe and heauinesse whereas the other is neuer sincere but with the sweetnes thereof hath alwaies mingled some bitternes euen in laughter saith salomon speaking thereof the heart is heauie when the face of the wicked man shineth and his countenance is pleasant euen then is he inwardly sorrowfull and his minde is troubled lastly the ioy of the spirit is eternall abiding in the mind of man not onely for the terme of this life but for euer in the world to come so is not the reioycing of the world in earthly things for it is fading and deceitfull as the things themselues be wherein it is placed it hath the beginning in corruption and endeth with this present life the examples of the two rich man in the gospel doe manifest this truth and to this purpose is the speech of zophar in the booke of iob that the reioycing of the wicked is very short amp the ioy of hypocrites is but a momet ampc by these fiue properties may we put a true difference betweene earthly and heauenly reioycing and consequently discerne of them euen in our seleues and if we perceiue this ioy of the spirit rightly con ceiued and grounded in the right vse of the word and sacraments as also in the exercises of inuocation faith and repentance to take place in our soules and consciences we shall finde it of force to moderate and alay the very terrours of death and so much for preparation now the helpes to be vsed in the time of death are manifold the summe of all may be reduced to two heads meditations and practises touching meditations we must in the first place consider death in a double respect one as it is in it owne nature and another as it is changed and qualified by the death of christ death in it owne nature is a curse or fore er of comdemnation the very gates and suburbs of hell it selfe but beeing qualified by christ it is a blessing an end of all miseries a full freedome from all dangers a short passage vnto ioy an entrance into euerlasting life a quiet sleepe voide of all annoyance by dreames and fantasies and the graue a resting chamber yes a bed perfumed by the death of christ for the body of all the elect out of which when they awake they shall be admitted amp receiued into the presence of god in heauen secondly we are to consider that there be three degrees of eternall life the first whereof is in this world before we die and it is then whe we begin to repent amp beleeue in christ and to be assured in conscience that god the father is our father christ our redeemer amp the holy ghost our comforter for this is eternall life to know god and him whome he hath sent iesus christ the next degree is in death for death cuts off al sin originall amp actuall death frees vs from al wordly miseries death prepareth the bodie that it may be fit to enter into eternall happinesse together with the soule which is alreadie in heauen the last degree is when bodie amp soule reunited goe both together into eternall and euerlasting glory our third meditation is that that there is a mysticall vnion and coniunctio betweene christ and euery beleeuer amp that not onely in regard of soule but of bodie also which beeing once knit shall neuer be dissolued but is eternall wherevpon the dying dead rotten and consumed bodie remaineth still a member of christ abideth within the couenant and is and shall be euer a temple of the holy ghost thus adam and abraham which are dead so many thousand yeares agoe yes euery true beleeuer from them to the end of the world shall arise at the last day in body to glory by the power of their coniunction with christ in the winter season we see the most trees voide of leaues buddes and blossomes so as they seeme to vs to be dead and yet neuerthelesse there is a sappe in the roote of them which in the spring wil ascend amp reuiue the decaied braches euen so it is with our body which though they be corrupted rotten burnt or eaten with wormes or deuoured by wild beast so as they may seeme to be vtterly perished yet there is as it were a secret and hidden sap in them by reason of their vnion with christ by which they shall be raised reuiued and quickned being made like vntothe glorious bodie of christ their head with whome they shall raigne and liue for euermore helpes in practise are two first he that will beare with comfort the pangs of death must labour that he may die in faith and that is done by laying hold of the promise of god touching forgiuenes of sinnes and life euerlasting by christ all these saith the holy ghost died in faith namely abel enoch no abraham and sarah all laying hold of the promise of life by christ when iacob on his death bed was blessing of his children he brake forth into this heauenly speach o lord i haue waited for thy saluation in which words it is plaine that his faith rested on the mercie of god and by hope he waited for his saluatio amp our sauiour christ saith as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lift vp that whosoeuer beleeueth in him might not perish but haue life euerlasting out of which words the forenamed duty may be learned that looke as the childre of israel being stung with fiery serpets amp that vnto death we healed by looking vp to the brase serpet erected by moses so whe we are stug with sin amp death we must euer remeber by faith to looke vpon christ but specially when we are dying then it is our part to sixe the eies of our soules by faith vpon him and thereby shall we escape death and be made partakers of eternall life and happinesse notable is the example of christ who as he was man alwaies fixed his trust and considence in his fathers word especially at his end for when he was dying and the pangs of death seazed vpon him he cries vnto the lord my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and againe father into thy hands i commend my spirit which words are full of faith and doe bewray what great affiance he placed in his fathers loue ampc when dauid in an extremitie saw nothing before his eies but present death the people in tending to stone him at the very instant as the text saith he comforted himselfe in the lord his god but how by calling to minde the mercifull promises that god had made vnto him and by applying them vnto his heart by faith and paul saith of himselfe amp the rest of the faithfull that they receiued the sentence of death in themselues that they might not trust in themselues but in god from these examples it followes that they which desire with comfort to beare the pangs of death must die by faith that is they must set before their eies the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting and depend vpon it wrapping as it were amp infolding theselues in it as in a close amp warm garment that will keepe them safe and sure against the winde and weather of temptation the second practise in the time of death is to die in obedience which is nothing else but willingly gladly and readily without murmuring to submit our selues vnto god will in bearing the paines of death a most worthie president of this obediece we haue in our sauiour christ when he said vnto his father not my will but thy will be done thereby submitting his will to his fathers wil touching the death which he then suffered yes when he was dying it is said of him that he gaue vp the ghost that is he did most willingly surrender vp his soule into the hands of god his father and this his exaple at the time of his departure must be a rule of directio vnto vs vpon the like occasion hence it is that in the third petitio of the lord praier amogst other things we pray for obedience to the will of god in suffering afflictions yes euen in the last and greatest which is death it self true it is that obedience to god in death is against corrupt nature and therefore our dutie is the more to inure our selues to the performing of it and that which the blessed apostle said of himselfe i die daily ought to be continually our resolution and practise if we shall inquire howe this may be done the answer is whe god layeth afflictions vpon vs in our life time then by endeauouring to beare them with patience meeknes and lowlines for euery affliction is as it were a pettie death and if we doe in it subiect our selues to the hand of god wee shall the better obey him in the great death of all and thus doing whensoeuer god striketh vs with death we shall with comfort endure the same the third particular affliction or distresse is satanicall molestation whereby both persons and places of mansion or abode are either possessed or otherwise molested by the malice of the deuill i touching this affliction the question of conscience is how such persons as are possessed or feare possession or else indure molestations by the deuill in their houses may haue their minds quieted and sta ed and consequently in that case be remedied and here two things are generally to be considered in way of answer first it is to be remembred that possession is knowne by two signes the one is when the deuill is euidently present either in the whole bodie or in some part of it the other when he hath rule of the said bodie either in whole or in part so as the partie himselfe hath not that vse of his bodie which he would as for example when the deuill possesseth the instruments of the voice as the tongue and makes a man to speake latine greeke italian or other tongues which he vnderstandeth not both these things were found in them that were possessed in the time of our sauiour christ secondly we must consider it falleth out oftentimes that straunge diseases doe seaze vpon man arising from corrupt humour in the bodie yes man and woman may haue straunge passions vpon naturall causes vnknowne and these will sometimes haue strange and extraordinarie effects in them which the article of physicke neither can search out nor cure and yet they are neither acts of witchcraft nor reall possessions as when god laid extraordinarie diseases on the corinthians for the contempt of his word and sacraments corinthian like vnto which he worthily inflicts vpon man in these daies for the same and other sinnes now to stay the minde in this case these rules are carefully to be thought vpon first of all it is to be remembred that though satans malice and power be very great and large yet he can not practise the same against the childre of god whe where and how he listeth the malice which satan beares to mankind and principally to the members of christ appeares in this because he is saide to accuse them before god day and night and as a roaring lyon to walke about the world seeking whome he may deuoure pet againe the scripture noteth him to be a powerfull spirit whose strength farre exceedeth and surpasseth the might of any man or creature that is not of an angelical nature as himselfe is for he is tearmed a prince of the aire and the god of this world his power reacheth euen to the spirits and soules of man whereby he worketh in the children of disobedience ephesian his principalitie is so great that no strength no defence of man is able to withstand it vnlesse man take vnto himselfe the whole armour of god ephesians now although the deuill be so malitious an enemie of mankind that he ceaseth not to deuise whatsoeuer may be hurtfull vnto them and withall so powerfull in his attempts that no man by his o ne proper strength is able to resist him yet he cannot put the least part of his power in execution in what time place or manner he desireth the reason is because god hath determined his power by certaine bounds and limits which he cannot passe and they are especially two the one is his owne nature whereby he is a creature and therefore finite hence it is that he can neither know nor doe any thing that is beyond the reach or capacitie of his nature or aboue the power and skill of a creature for example he cannot directly and immediatly know the deepe things of god vnlesse they be reuealed vnto him nor yet the secrets of mans heart none knoweth the things of a man saue the spirit of a man which is in him ouen so the things of god knoweth none but the spirit of god corinthian againe he cannot doe that which is truly and properly a miracle the cause whereof is hidden and vtterly vnknowne and which comes not within the power and order of nature for this is proper vnto god who onely doth things simply wonderfull psalm the second thing whereby satans power is restrained is the will of god for looke as the sea beeing by nature apt to ouerflow the whole earth is kept in and shut vp within the shore as it were with dores or gates that it cannot breake forth and that by the lord himselfe who hath established his decree vpon it iob so though satan be by nature strong and his malice great yet can he doe nothing at all no nor execute his naturall power to the hurt and preiudice of any man without the will and permission of god thus the euill spirit could not goe forth to deceiue ahab vntill the lord had said vnto him goe and thou shalt preuaile king thus the deuill could not touch the bodie children goods or friends of righteous iob whilest he was fenced and fortified by the power and prouidence of god but when the lord in regard of iobs outward estate had giuen leaue and said loe all that he hath is in thine hand then did he exercise his power to the vtmost yet so farre onely as he was permitted and no further iob the consideration of this first point that satans power is determined by god will serue to stay the minds of those whose persons houses or friends are molested by him for hereupon it followeth that god who hath the deuill bound vp as it were in chaines will not suffer his power to be inlarged against his owne children to their destruction and confusion but so farre forth alone as shall be expedient for their good and saluation againe that god beeing their father in christ iesus they may in the time of such affliction haue accesse vnto him amp call vpon him for the restraint of satans power and malice and consequently for the deliuerance of them and theirs a second rule is this such persons must haue recourse to god in his word in which he promiseth his presence and protection to his children in their greatest dangers and namely that there shall no euill come vnto them neither any plague shall come neere their dwelling because he will giue his angels charge ouer them to keepe them in all their waies againe that he will be a wall of fire round about his people zach that he will extend peace ouer his church like a flood isa and that there shal be no sorcery against iacob nor soothsaying in rael numb and yet if god sees it to be good for his children to be tried by possessions or witchcraft in this case the promise frees them not for all temporall blessings are promised conditionally so farre forth as they may stand with god good will and pleasure and withall may make for the good of his children howbeit herein lies the comfort that though such calamities befall them yet they shall turne to their good rather then to their hurt this point well considered by the way bewraieth the great presumption of some who are not afraid to say their faith is so strong that the deuill cannot touch them thirdly it must be considered that the best servant of god haue beene in their times molested by the deuill christ in his second temptation was carried by the deuill from the wilderness to a wing of the temple of ierusalem the children of iob were destroied by the deuill amp he himselfe was filled with bo ches and sores a certaine woman euen a daughter of abraham that is one following the faith of abraham was troubled with a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeares together and the daughter of the woman of canaan was grieuously vexed with a deuill math fourthly man in this case ought by faith to lay fast hold vpon the promise of life euerlasting and wait the lord leisure not limiting him in respect of time or meanes of deliuerance this was the practise of iob though he kill me yet will i trust in him and of holy abraham who did not limit god but was content to doe with isaac what the lord would and though it was in likelihood a meane to bereaue him of all posteritie yet still he kept himselfe to the promise lastly man must in this case seeke and sue vnto god by praier either for deliuerance if it may stand with his good will and pleasure or els for patience that they may meekly and patiently beare that particular affliction ii in the molestation and annoyance of houses by spirits two things are to be remembred first man must not consort together and abide there where it is certenly knowne that the lord hath giuen the deuill power and libertie least in so doing they tempt the lord our sauiour christ did not of his owne priuate motion and will betake himselfe into the wildernes but by the direction of the holy ghost math paul in like manner did not of his owne head goe to ierusalem but vpon the motion of the spirit act in the light of these examples man arc taught not to cast themselues into any places of apparant danger much lesse to frequent those which god hath deliuered vp into the power of satan and this condemneth the rash and headie conceits of some persons who vpon confidence of their owne strength doe put themselues into needelesse dangers hauing neither extraordinarie calling from god nor any sufficient warrant out of his word if it be asked what man are to doe in this case i answer first that they ought rather to flie to god by praier and to draw neere vnto him in their hearts and he in mercie will draw neere vnto them secondarily that which we doe in meats and drinkes is also to be done in the houses and places where we dwell and what is that we must sanctifie them to our vse by the word and prayer noah at god commandement went into the arke abode in it and came out againe and when he came forth of it into the earth afterward it is said of him that he built an altar gaue thaks to god for his deliuerance and praied the lord to vouch safe him the vse of the earth as he had before though abraham had a promise of the land of canaan to him and his posteritie for euer yet he went not out of his countrey toward it till the lord commanded him and when he was come thither he built an altar for the worship and seruice of god the like he did afterward at bethel and many yeares after did iacob offer sacrifice vnto god in the same bethel when he came to dwell there and for this very end in the law by a speciall ordinance the first fruites of the haruest were offered to sanctifie the rest of the corne and so much touching the second distresse of the third speciall distresse arising of the tentation of blasphemie the third kind of trouble of mind is that which ariseth of the tentation of blasphemie which in regard of the vilenes and vglinesse thereof is not amisse tearmed by some the foule tentation and it is when a man is troubled in his minde with blasphemous cogitations and thoughts directly against the maiestie of god the father the son and the holy ghost as for example to thinke that god is not iust or mercifull that he accepteth mens persons that he hath not knowledge of things that are done here below or at least that de doth not regard them that god cannot doe this or that that he is iniurious to some man and partiall to others ampc these and such like blasphemous thoughts there be which are not fit to be vttered amongst me forasmuch as they are most horrible and execrable as any can be conceiued that we may the better know this temptation let it be considered what are the forerunners thereof and by what meanes it takes place in the heart possessed of it sometimes it commeth meerely and onely of the suggestion of the deuill which troubleth the phantasie euen of those which are in that regard innocent and casteth into their hearts impure and vngodly thoughts sometimes againe it comes vpon man by an euill custome when as they willingly lend their eares to leude and cursed speeches that immediately tend to the dishonour of god or the wilfull abuse of his word his iudgements and mercies and vpon the hearing either giue their applause and approbation though not expressely or doe not hinder or stay them as much as in them lyeth otherwhiles it creepes into the heart of man by degrees when he beginnes to waxe cold in god seruice to make little conscience of those duties that immediately concerne his worship amp consequently inures himselfe to the taking of the name of god in vaine by often and causelesse swearing forswearing cursing ampc by these and such like meanes is this foule and horrible tentation conua ed into the minde of man now the danger of it whether it ariseth from these or any other causes is exceeding grieuous specially to those that haue begun to chuse the way of truth and to applie their hearts to serue god and to feare his name for it bringeth forth strange and fearfull effects as namely desperation and manifold horrors amp troubles of minde yes diverse persons haue hereupo bin astonished in such sort that they haue bin mooued to make dispatch of themselues beeing in their owne iudgement no better then the very firebrands of hell now for the curing of this wonderfull trouble and distraction of conscience two things are to be done to wit inquirie must be made into the next causes whence this tentation should arise and after that the remedie is to be applied for the first inquirie is to be made whether the present distresse had his beginning from the thoughts of a mans owne minde or from the suggestion of the deuill for this is in all likelyhoode the next way to minister comfort to the afflicted partie it may be said how shall a man discerne the thoughts that are from the deuill from his owne thoughts ans he shall know them by sundrie notes first by the entrance of the into the mind for those that co e from the diuill come speedily as lightning into a house and they are after a sort forced into the minde by violence so as the partie cannot auoide them and they come into the minde againe and againe yes a thousand times in a day so as by their often comming they weaken the memorie dull the senses wearie and confound the braine these are thoughts that come from the deuill and by him are co uaied from without into the minde of man and if such cogitations were from a mans own self they would not come with so great vehemecie and cel ritie but with leisure and they would rise with more moderation and lesse violence yes further the frequent vse of them would not produce so many and so fearfull effects as it doth secondly such thoughts may be discerned to come from the devil by this signe because they are directly against the very light of nature the sparkes whereof are not quite extinct in vs by sinne for euery man thinkes reuerently of god by nature but these cogitations are most wicked and deuilish fastning vpon god things that are most vile and monstrous whereas commonly the thoughts that arise from our selues are not against the light of nature though they be most corrupt the third signe is that at the first conceiuing of them the partie smitten with an extraordinarie feare his flesh is troubled and oftentimes sicknes and faintings doe follow but the thoughts that man conceiue of theselues cause neither feare nor fainting nor sicknes fourthly blasphemous thoughts cannot come ordinarily from the hart of any saue of those alone that are of reprobate mindes but the parties that are thus distressed are honest ciuill and such as professe the gospell at least in shew yes sometime they befall such as are the true members of christ therefore it is manifest that they come from without euen from the deuill casting them into the minde and not from within a mans owne selfe in the next place inquirie must be made whether the partie doth approoue loue and like these and such like thoughts or no to this he will answer if he be asked that he abhors them as the deuill and hell it selfe thus euen naturall man will answer amp that truly after inquirie thus made the remedie is to be applied and the first and principall remedie pertaines to doctrine and instruction in which the partie is to be informed of his or her estate namely that the foresaid blasphemies are not his sinnes but his crosses for they are the devil sinnes and he shall answer for them and they are not ours till we intertaine receiue approoue and giue consent vnto them for proofe hereof let this be considered that vncleane thoughts which haue their residence in the minde of man are of two sorts inward and outward inward are such as haue their originall from the flesh and arise of the corruption of mans nature though stirred vp by the deuill and these at the very first conceiuing are our sins though they haue no long abode in our mindes and they are directly forbidden in the tenth commandement outward thoughts are those which haue relation to an outward cause or beginning of which sort are those euill thoughts that be conueied into the minde by the deuill and if we take no pleasure in them nor yeeld consent vnto them they are not to be accounted our sinnes but the deuills by whome they are suggested the truth hereof appeares in christs example into whose minde the deuill cast this blasphemous tentation thereby moouing him to infidelitie co etousnes and idolatry which neuerthelesse were not his sinnes because his holy heart gaue not the least approbation to them but abhorred and repelled them and therefore was free from any taint of sinne in or by them this distinction of thoughts must be remembred for hence it followes that blasphemous thoughts not consented to by vs are not our sinnes but the deuills euen as in like case whe one wickedly disposed sollicites another to treason or murder if the said partie listen not nor yeild thereto he cannot be holden guiltie of those crimes therfore man must not feare those kind of thoughts ouermuch at lest if they please not theselues ouermuch in them because though they be indeede their crosses yet are they not their personall sinnes for which they shall incurre the wrath and displeasure of god againe they must let them goe as they come they are not to striue against them for the more they labour to resist them the more shall they be intangled with them the second thing to be vsed in way of remedy for the staying of the mind in this tentation is that though it should be graunted that the foresaid euill and blasphemous thoughts are our sinnes yet we are to remember that they may through the mercie and goodnesse of god be pardoned if they be heartily and vnfeinedly repented of yes further that neither they nor any other sins except that against the holy ghost doe condemne him that praieth against them amp is heartily sorrie for them it was pauls complaint rom that he did not the good which he would doe speaking of the inward indeauour of his heart and againe that he did the euill which he would not meaning in respect of the corruption of his nature now vpon this that he indeauoured to doe that which was agreable to the will of god that he loathed and detested the contrarie and stroue against his corruptions how did he comfort himselfe marke the wordes following v if i doe that i would not that is to say if against my generall purpose i sinne against god if i be sorrie for it if i be displeased with my selfe because i can not obey god in that perfectio i desire it is no more i that do it but sinne that dwelleth in me fro this example of paul i gather that if any man haue in his minde euill thoughts and doeth as paul did grieue because he therby offendeth god if he doe abhorre them and pray against them he shall not be condemned for them they shall neuer be laid to his charge the partie then that is troubled with with these thoughts may vpo these grounds stay his minde and comfort himselfe for if he shall not be condemned for them then let him not feare them aboue measure the third point to be remembred is that the partie must not be alone for this tentation beginnes and is confirmed and increased by solitarinesse and the parties thus distressed loue to be apart by themselues from the societie of others and for that cause in case they be lyable to this distresse they must vse to converse with such company as may afford them matter of speech and conference meete for them and may exercise their mindes with heauenly meditations in the word and singing of psalmes and such like fitte and conuenient recreations our first parent eue was tempted by satan when shee was apart from adam and our sauiour christ when he was alone out of company and societie then did the deuill most malitiously assault him with strong and powerfull tentations in the wildernes the fourth point to be remembred of the partie troubled is that he must as heartily and earnestly repent him of those his euill thoughts as of euill wordes and deedes for the truth is because man are loose minded and haue no more care of their thoughts then commonly they haue therefore the lord iustly suffers the deuill to plague and torment them by conuaying into their hearts most vile and damnable cogitations furthermore the said partie must labour to be renued in the spirit of his minde that is to haue his minde inlightened by the spirit whereby he may know and vnderstand the will of god in his word after repentance for euill thoughts there must follow watchfulnesse and a carefull circumspection ouer all his waies but principally he must haue an eye vnto his heart the fountaine of all keepe thine heart with all diligence saith salomon that is aboue all things see that thou countergard thy thoughts desires motions and affections that the heart of a man may be guarded two rules are to be obserued first that the word of god dwell plentifully in it by daily meditation of the commandements promises and threatnings reuealed in the same it is noted by dauid as a propertie of a blessed man that he exerciseth himselfe in meditatio of the law of god day and night psalm by this meanes the heart will be clensed and purged from vncleane and polluted motions and so guided amp directed that it swarue not from god this rule is of speciall vse for therefore doe man hatch and breed euill thoughts in their hearts because they are not taken vp with holy meditations and hence it is that the heart of man is made euen a pray vnto the deuill because the word of god is not lodged therein excellent was the practise of dauid in this case who kept the word of god in his heart that he might not sinne against him the second rule of the keeping of the heart is to establish our thoughts by counsell it is the wise mans aduise in so many words prov wherein he would teach vs that it is the propertie of a worldly wise man in matters of waight not to trust to his owne wit but to follow the direction and counsell of wise and skilfull man and if this be a sound course in matters of the world much more ought it to be taken in the maine matters of religion and conscience concerning the heart and soule of man and therefore by the lawe of proportion it giues vs direction not once to thinke or conceiue so much as a thought but vpon aduice and direction taken at god and his word thy testimonies saith dauid are my delight and my counsellers and what benefit had he by taking such a course surely by the word of god which was his continuall meditation he gat vnderstanding he became wiser then the auncient it made him to hate all the waies of falshood it kept him from declining from god either to the right hand or to the left the same rule must be practised of vs in the vse of our senses our speeches and actions and then shall the heart be kept cleane and free from these temptations and seeing this temptation is so daungerous and fearefull as hath beene said amp doth often befall man our dutie is to make conscience of practising the foresaid rules continually and thus much concerning the third kinde of distresse of conscience of the fourth speciall distresse arising from a mans owne sinnes the fourth distresse of minde is that which ariseth from a mans owne sinnes or rather from some one speciall sinne committed and this kind of tentation is twofold for either it is more violent and lesse common or lesse violent and more common the violent distresse of minde shewes it selfe by feares and terrours of the conscience by doubtings of the mercie of god by lamentable and fearefull complaint made to others now question is mooued howe this violent distresse of minde arising from our owne sinnes is to be cured answer that it may be cured by the blessing of god three things must be done first that particular sinne must be known which is the cause of this violent distresse and here we are to know by the way that it is an vsuall thing with the parties thus distressed to dissemble and cloake their sinnes and therefore they will alleadge that their trouble ariseth from some euill thoughts from wicked affections and from the corruption of nature whereas commonly man are not distressed in violent manner for euill thoughts affections ampc but the violent distresse commeth from so e actuall and odious sinne or sinnes done which wound the conscience and are the causes of great distraction of minde and they are many which hauing bin vpon occasion before rehearsed i will not now repeat them onely this must be remembred that the greater sinns against the third sixt and seuenth commandements are the maine and proper causes of violent distresses and the more secret the sinne is in regard of the practise thereof the greater horror of conscience it bringeth and open offences doe not giue so deepe a wound vnto it as secret and hidden sinnes secodly the particular sinne being known inquirie must be made as much as possibly may be by signes whether the partie distressed repenteth yes or no for except he hath repented he cannot be fitted to receiue comfort amp vnlesse he be first fitted to receiue cofort he cannot be releeued in conscience now if it be found that the partie hath repented then care must be had in the next place that his repentance may be renued for the particular sinne committed thirdly hauing thus done the comfort must be ministred for the moderating or taking away of the distresse and here remember by the way that the comforts ministred vsually and ordinarily must not goe alone but be mingled and tempered with some terror of the law that beeing thereby feared with the consideration of sinne and of the wrath of god due vnto the same the comfort may appeare to be the sweeter the ministring whereof in case of this distresse would not be direct and present but by certaine steppes and degrees except onely in the point of death for then a directer course must be vsed these degrees are two first the partie is to be informed of a possibilitie of pardon that is that his sinnes are pardonable and though in themselues they be great and hainous yet by the mercie of god in christ they may be remitted now put the case that the afflicted apprehendeth onely the odiousnesse of his sinnes and the wrath of god due to the same and in this fitte puts off the pardon from himselfe and cannot be perswaded that his sinne may be forgiuen what then is to be done ans then for the effecting of this first degree certaine grounds are to be laid downe whereupon assurance in that case may be built vp in his heart the first ground of possibilitie of pardon is that the mercie of god is infinite yes ouer all his works psalm that the death of christ is of infinite price merit and value before god that god is much in sparing isa that with the lord is mercie and with him is plenteous redemption psalm that christs satisfaction is not onely a price but a counterprice tim able to satisfie for the sinnes of all man yes for them that haue sinned against the holy ghost for that sinne is not therefore vnpardonable because the offence thereof is greater then the merit of christ but because th partie offending neither doth nor can applie the merit of christ vnto himselfe an ancient father vpon cains wordes my punishment is greater then i can beare saith thou liest cain for god mercie is greater then the sinnes of all man the mercie of god was very great to manasses to salomon to peter and to many others though they were great offenders the second ground man of yeares liuing in the church of god and knowing the doctrine of saluation shall not be condemned simply for their sinnes but for lying in their sinnes vpon this ground i say that man distressed must be grieued not so much for committing of sinne as for lying and continuing in sinnes committed a third ground it pleaseth god many times to leaue man to themselues and to suffer them to commit some sinne that woundeth conscience it is true and cannot be denied but we must withall remember that sinnes committed doe not vtterly take away grace but rather make it the more to shine and shew it selfe for god in mercie turneth all things euen sinne it selfe to the good of them that be his and therefore sinne committed cannot either waste or extinguish grace receiued but by diuine dispensation serueth to amplifie and inlarge the same so as where sinne aboundeth there grace aboundeth much more rom and the lord saide to paul beeing in great extremitie corinthian my grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect through weakenes hence it appeareth that the grace of god is not vtterly lost but appeareth liuely in the time of distresse the fourth ground is this the promises of god touching remission of sinnes and life eternall in respect of beleeuers are generall and in regard of all and euery man indefinite that is they doe not define or exclude any person or any sinner or any time onely they admit one exception of finall impenitencie here a question may be mooued how long he that ministreth comfort must stand vpon the possibilitie of pardon i answer vntill he hath brought the partie distressed to some measure of true repentance and this beeing done then he is to proceede to the second degree of comfort the second degree of comfort is to teach that the sinne or sinnes of the partie distressed are indeede pardoned but it may be asked vpon what signes may this comfort be applyed i answer vpon these two first if the partie distressed confesse that he or shee is heartily grieued that by their sinne or sinnes they haue offended so louing and so mercifull a god secondly if they professe that they desire with all their heart to be reconciled vnto god in christ and at least doe desire to repent for their sinnes and withall doe carrie in heart a purpose to sinne no more but in all things as much as in them lieth to performe new obedience vnto god luke ampc now for the better enforcing of this comfort some textes of scripture fitting this purpose must be rehearsed a for example matth i came not to call the righteous that is to say those that iudge themselues righteous but sinners that is those which are grieued because in their owne conscience they are vile and hainous offenders to repentance againe matth come vnto me all ye that are wearie and heauie laden and i will refresh you and christ saith it was the end of his coming to preach deliuerance to the captiues and to set at libertie them that are bruised luke to conclude this point there remaines yet a further question to be resolued and that is this a man after repentance for some greiuous sinne falls into it againe and is distressed more then before it is a cause somewhat grieuous for we knowe that if a man be recouered of an ague and through distemper in diet or otherwise makes a relapse into it againe his case is often desperate and he hardly scapeth with his life in the same maner it is a dangerous case if after repentance man make a relapse into the same sinne againe it may then be asked how such persons may be recouered after a relapse i answer though we find not any one particular example in scripture of any one person that was restored againe after a relapse yet neuerthelesse there is some comfort for such persons vpon what grounds may some say ans man that haue not so much as a drop of mercie in comparison of god must forgiue ther brother often and many times yes as our sauiour christ saith to peter till seuenty times seuen times if they returne and say it repents them now god is infinite in all his attributes he is much in sparing with him is plenteous redemption and therefore he will questionlesse vpon true repentance often forgiue and forget euen the same sinne iterated againe and againe nowe these persons are to be releiued in this sort first they must haue their consciences setled in this point that their relapse is pardonable though very dangerous for proof hereof read esay where mention is made of diverse apostataes that were by god called to repentace with promise of don if they turned vnto him and in luke the prodigall child by whome i vnderstand one that after grace receiued fell from his repentance and obedience to god when he did but purpose in his heart to returne again was pardoned and receiued into fauour in the corinthian paul saith to the corinths that were fallen away we pray you in christs steade that ye be reconciled vnto god secondly beeing thus setled in consciece they must againe repent them of their sinnes thirdly and lastly they are to be comforted with the promise of remission of sinnes after that some signes of renewed repetance for sinnes past haue beene giuen the second kinde of this tentation or trouble of minde which is more common amp lesse violent befalls the children of god and it is a griefe of heart more or lesse whereby man are troubled in respect of the want of grace in their hearts and defects of obedience in their liues paul the deere servant of god was possessed with this trouble of minde as we may read rom and indeede there is no child of god but more or lesse one time or other he feeles the stings of sinne and the buffetings of satan which cause griefe in his heart but this griefe is a notable grace of god and therefore they which want it must labour to haue it and they which haue it must not seeke to put it out but to keepe it in measure and order and the grounds of comfort whereby the heart may be sta ed in this sorrow that it be not immoderate may be these i ground it is god will that the worke of sanctification or regeneration should be imperfect in this life and remaine vnfinished til death this point needs no proofe it is manifest both in the word of god and in daily experience the reasons for which god will haue it to be so may be these first of all god giues grace according to the measure and manner of our receiuing of it which in this life is imperfect some giftes of god in christ bestowed on his servant as remission of sinnes by his death and iustification by his obedience are not put into vs but are only applied and made ours by imputation some other giftes there be which are infused and put into vs as namely sanctification regeneration the loue of god and man and by one of these two meanes to wit either by imputation or infusion are all the giftes of god in christ made ours yet before we can haue them we must receiue the and the meanes whereby we receiue them is faith which god hath ordained to be the hand of our soules to receiue his benefits bestowed on vs which faith because it is weake and imperfect in this life therefore the gifts which we receiue thereby are also imperfect for though god benifits be like a bottomlesse sea yet the faith wherby we lay hold of them is like vnto a vessell with a narrow necke which though it be cast into the great ocean receiues but a little water at once and that by degrees droppe by droppe according to the widenesse of the mouth and hence it is that though the gifts of god without vs which are ours by imputation be perfect yet all such graces as are put into vs are weake and imperfect secondly if any servant of god should be perfectly regenerate and made absolutely holy in this life then he should fulfill the morall lawe and so become a sauiour to himselfe and by the tenour of the law haue life and so should not christ be a sauiour properly but only an instrumet to dispose vs to the keeping of the law whereby we might saue our selues but there is one only all sufficient sauiour christ iesus and the beginning the middle and the accomplishmet of our saluation is to be ascribed to him alone thirdly it is the wil god that his owne children with whome he is well pleased in christ should be brought to nothing in themselues that they might be all in all out of themselues in christ being as it were emptied of selfe loue and of all confidence in their owne goodnesse but if sanctification should be perfect at the first then a man should not goe out of himselfe but would rather stay as he is and rest contented in his owne goodnesse for this cause paul after his exaltation was buffeted by satans temptations that he might not be exalted out of measure corinthian but should content himselfe with this that he was in the loue and fauour of god in christ ii ground is to consider what makes a man professing christ accepted of god and howe much he himselfe must doe for this end the substance of all things to be done of vs for this ende that we may become the children of god may be reduced to three heads first of all we must heartily bewaile our sinnefull liues past and seriously humble our selues in regard of our owne sinnes both of heart and life and if by occasion wee fall into any sinne we must not lie therein but by speedie repentance recouer our former estate secondly in regard of the sinnefulnesse of our hearts and liues in times past we must rest our selues on god mercie alone lying to the throne of mercie for the pardon of them all thirdly we must indeauour in the course of our liues afterward to performe obediece to god in all his commandements that thereby we may shew our selues thankefull to him for his mercie and profit in our obedience for proofe hereof first consider the examples of this practise in god children all that dauid that worthie servant of god could doe after his sinnes committed to bring himselfe againe into the fauour of god whome he had offended consisted of these very heads which haue beene named repentance confidence and affiance in god mercie and performance of new obedience and this his practise was verified amongst many other places specially in the psalme amp in all the psalmes commonly called penitentiall againe the prophet daniel was accepted of god onely for the doing of these things daniel and in like manner was paul and the rest of the apostles rom tim againe for further proofe let it be considered what it is that makes a man to become a christian and servant of god not this that he is pure from all sinnes and neuer slides or swar es from obedience vnto god but because when he sinneth and falleth he is grieued with himselfe and laboureth euery day to mortifie his corruptions which are the matter of sinne in his heart and life and suffereth not sinne to reigne in his mortall bodie but crucifieth the flesh with the affections and lusts therof yet here remaines a great difficultie many a good servant of god may and doth truly say of himselfe i bewaile my sinnes and doe in some sort rest on god mercie and withall i endeauour to performe new obedience but alas here is my griefe i cannot doe these things as i would in matter of sorrow and griefe i am troubled with hardnes of heart in occasions of boldnes and confidence with doubtings endeauour to obey with many slippes and sundrie falls for the staying amp moderating of this griefe these rules may further be remembre the first rule if there be in the minde a purpose not to sinne in the will a desire to please god and in the whole man n endeauour to performe the purpose of the minde and the desire of the will marke what followes vpon this god in mercie accepteth the purpose and will to obey for obedience it selfe yes though a man faile in the very act and do not so well as he should the lord accepteth the affection and endeauour for the thing done excellent is the saying of an auncient father god accepteth that which is his and forgiues that which is thine his is the grace whereby we are inabled to endeauour to obey in the want of obedience and that he accepteth ours i the sinne and weakenes in performance of the dutie which he requireth and that he doth in mercie forgiue herein appeareth the great goodnes of god vnto vs and we can neuer be sufficiently thankfull for the same but yet that we may not here delude our hearts with conceits and bless our selues in vaine we must knowe that god doth not alwaies accept the will for the deede vnlesse there be a constant purpose in heart a true desire in will and some resolued indeauour sutable in the life malac god spares them that feare him s a father spares his own child how is that though the sick or weake child beeing com ed some busines goeth about it very vnhandsomly and so the deede be done to little no purpose yet the father accepts it as well done if he see the childe yoelde vnto his commandement and doe his indeauour to the vttermost of his power euen so will god deale with those that be his children though sicke and weake in obedience r how will some say can god accept a worke of ours that is imperfect ans so farre forth as the obedience is done in truth so farre forth god accepts it because it is his owne worke in vs and as it is ours he pardons it vnto vs because we are in christ a second rule is laid downe rom where paul saith to this purpose the good which i would doe i doe not and the euill which i would not that do i in these words is set down the state of all regenerate man in this life and the meaning is this the good things which god hath commanded i doe them but not as i would and the euill forbidden i auoid but not as i would this we shall see to be true by comparing the voices of three kindes of man together the carnall man saith i doe not that which is good neither will i do it and that which is euill i doe and i will doe it contrariwise the man glorified he saith that which is good i do and will doe it and that which is euill i doe not neither will i doe it the regenerate man in a middle betweene them both he saith the good things commanded i do but not as i would the euill things forbidden i avoid but not as i would and this is the estate of the child of god in this life who in this regard is like vnto a diseased man who loues his health and therfore obserues both diet and physick and yet he often falls into his fit againe though he be neuer so carefull to obserue the rules of the physitian by reason of the distemperature of his bodie and hereupon is saine to goe to the physitian the second time for new counsell in like manner god children haue indeede in their hearts a care to please and obey god but by reason of sinne that dwelleth in them they aile often and so are aine to humble themselues again before him by new repentance againe the servant of god are like to a man by some suddaine accident cast into the sea who in striuing to saue himselfe from drowning puts to all his strength to swim to the shore and beeing come almost vnto it their meetes him a waue or billow which driues him cleane backe againe it may be a mile or further and then the former hope and ioy conceiued of escape is sore abated yet he returnes againe and still labours to come to the land and neuer rests till he attaine vnto it iii ground he that is indeede regenerate hath this priuiledge that the corruption of nature is no part of him neither doth it belong to his person in respect of diuine imputation paul saith of himselfe rom it is no more i but sinne that dwelleth in me in which words he distinguisheth betweene his owne person and sinne that is in him for in man regenerate there be three things the bodie the soule and the gift of god image restored againe now touching the corruption of nature that is in his person and so may be said to be his but it belongs not to the man regenerate it is not his because it is not imputed to him and so indeed is as though it were not in him the apostle thess praies for the thessalonians that god would sanctifie them throughout and preserue their whole spirit soule and bodie of which place amongst many this exposition may be giuen the apostle speaking of man regenerate and sanctified makes three parts in them bodie soule and spirit and by spirit we are to vnderstand not the conscience but the gift of regeneration and sanctification which is the whole man bodie and soule opposed to the flesh which in a naturall man is called the olde man rom and the praier which paul makes in the behalfe of the thessalonians teacheth vs in effect thus much that though corruption remaine in the regenerate after regeneration yet in respect of diuine acceptation he is accounted as righteous and so continueth his sinne by the mercie of god in christ not beeing imputed to him to condemnation and so much for that point now these grounds of comfort and others of the like nature may serue to sustaine and vphold the hearts of the children of god when they shall be pressed and troubled in consideration of their estate in this life which cannot till death be fully freed from much weakenes and manifold imperfections of the fift speciall distresse arising from a mans owne bodie the fift and last kind of temptation or trouble of minde ariseth from a mans owne bodie before i enter to speake thereof one question in the meane time must be answered namely how the bodie beeing an earthly substance should trouble or annoie the minde considering that the minde is not bodily out spirituall for nothing can worke aboue it owne power and it is against reason that that which is bodily should either alter or trouble a spirit for answer hereunto these things must be considered first of all the actions of man though they be sundrie yet they all proceede from one onely fountaine and common cause the soule and are done by the power thereof the bodie of it selfe is not an agent in any worke but as it were a dead instrument in and by which the soule produceth all actions and workes secondly though all the actions of man come from the soule yet the most of them are such as be performed by the bodie and the parts thereof and by the spirits that are seated in the bodie as by instruments indeede some actions of the soule and minde are done without the helpe of the bodie but i say that the most of them are wrought by the bodie and spirits therein contained and yet notwithstanding the spirits in theselues are no agent at all but the onely agent in any worke is the soule it selfe for example the vsing of the outward senses as of sight hearing tasting touching smelling as also of the inward as imagination memorie ampc all this is done by the braine and the parts of the braine as proper instruments all affections both good and bad come from the soule but yet they are done and acted in and by meanes of the heart and vitall spirits so also the powers of life and nourishment proceede from the soule and yet they are done and wrought by the liuer and other inward parts as instruments whereby the soule nourisheth the bodie in a word there is no naturall action in man but for the effecting thereof the parts of the bodie are vsed as it were the hands and instruments of the soule and all this comes by reason of the vnion of the bodie with the soule whereby they make one person hence it followeth that when the bodie is troubled the soule is also troubled now the bodie affecteth and hurteth the soule and minde not by taking away or diminishing any part thereof for the soule is indivisible nor by depriuing it of any power or facultie giuen it of god for as the soule it selfe and the parts thereof so also all the faculties of the same remaine whole and entire without abating or diminishing but by corrupting the action of the minde or more properly by corrupting the next instrument whereby the minde worketh and consequently the action it selfe this may be conceiued by a comparison a skilfull artificer in any science hauing an vnfit toole to worke withall though his skill be good and his abilitie sufficient yet his instrument wherewith he worketh being bad the worke which he doth must needes be an imperfect worke howbeit the toole takes not away the skill of his workemanship nor his power of working onely it hinders him from shewing his skill and doing that well which otherwise he should and could doe well in like manner the bodie beeing corrupted hinders the worke of the soule not by taking away the worke of the soule or the abilitie of working but by making it to bring forth a corrupt worke because the instrument which it vseth is corrupt and faultie and thus we must conceiue of all the annoyances of the soule by the bodie the temptation followeth the bodie causeth the trouble of minde two waies either by melancholie or by some strange alterations in the parts of the bodie which oftentimes befall man in what sort we shall see afterwards for troubles of minde thus caused are more common and as noysome as the most of the former touching that which comes by melancholy sundrie things are to be considered for our instruction and for the remedie of that euill and first of all if it be asked what melancholy is i answer it is a kinde of earthie and blacke blood specially in the splene corrupted and distempered which when the splene is stopt conuaies it selfe to the heart and the braine and there partly by his corrupt substance and contagious qualitie and partly by corrupt spirits annoyeth both heart and braine beeing the seates and instruments of reason and affections the second is what are the effects and operations of melancholie ans they are strange and often fearefull there is no humour yes nothing in mans bodie that hath so straunge effects as this humour hath beeing once distempeted an auncient diuine calls it the deuills bait because the deuill beeing well acquainted with the complexion and temperature of man by god iust permission conueies himselfe into this humour and worketh strange conceits it is recorded in scripture that when the lord tooke his good spirit from saul wherby he did carrie himselfe well in the gouernment of his people and an euill spirit came vpon him he was in so fearfull a case that he would haue slaine him that was next vnto him how so surely because god in iustice withdrew his spirit from him and suffered satan to enter into the humour of choler or melancholie or both and by this meanes caused him to offer violence to dauid now the effects therof in particular are of two sorts the first is in the braine and head for this humour being corrupted it sends vp noysome fumes as cloudes or mists which doe corrupt the imagination and makes the instrument of reason unfit for vnderstanding and sense hence followes the first effect strange imaginations conceits and opinions framed in the minde which are the first worke of this humour not properly but because it corrupteth the instrument and the instrument beeing corrupted the facultie cannot bring forth good but corrupt actions examples hereof are well knowne i will onely touch one or two one is called the beastiall or beastlike melancholie a disease in the braine whereby a man thinkes himselfe to be a beast of this or that kind and carries himselfe accordingly and here with haue all those beene troubled which haue thought themselues to be wolues and haue practised woluish behauiour againe it is said of nebuchadnezzar daniel that he was driuen from man and did eate grasse as the oxen that is behaued himselfe and fed as a beast now some are of opinion that his humane shape was taken from him and that he was transformed into a beast at least that he had the soule of a beast in stead of an humane soule for a time but they are deceiued for there is no such transportation of soules into body either of man or beast others thinke that nebuchadnezzar was smitten in the braine with this disease of beastlike melancholy whereby he was so bereft of his right minde that he carried himselfe as a beast and this interpretation is not against the text for in the verse of that chapter it is said that his minde came to him againe and therefore in the disease his vnderstanding and the right vse of his reason was lost and the like is true in historie by diverse examples though it were not true in nebuchadnezzar againe take another example that is common and ordinarie let a melancholike person vpon the sudden heare or see some fearfull thing the strength of his imagination is such that he will presently fasten the thing vpon himselfe as if he see or heare that a man hath hanged himselfe or is possessed with a devil it presently comes to his mind that he must doe so vnto himselfe or that he is or at least shall be possessed in like manner vpon relation of fearefull things presently his phantasie workes and he imagineth that the thing is alreadie or shall befall him and this imagination when it enters once and takes place it brings forth horrible and fearefull effects the second effect or worke of melancholy is vpon the heart for there is a concord and consent betweene the heart and the braine the thoughts and the affections the heart affecting nothing but that which the minde conceiueth now when the minde hath conceiued imagined and framed within it selfe fearefull thoughts then comes affection and is answerable to imagination and hence proceede exceeding horrours feares and despaires euen of saluation it selfe and yet the conscience for all this vntouched and not troubled or disquieted thirdly it may be demanded whether there be any difference betweene the trouble of conscience and melancholy for many hold that they are all one ans they are not all one but differ much affliction of conscience is one thing trouble by melancholy is an other and they are plainly distinguished thus first when the conscience is troubled the affliction it selfe is in the conscience and so in the whole man but in melancholy the imagination is disturbed and not the conscience secondly the conscience afflicted hath a true and certen cause whereby it is troubled namely the sight of sinne and the sense of god wrath but in melancholy the imagination conceiueth a thing to be so which is not so for it makes a man to feare and despaire vpon supposed and fained causes thirdly the man afflicted in conscience hath courage in many other matters but the melancholike man feares euery man euery creature yes himselfe and hath no courage all but feares when there is no cause of feare fourthly imaginations in the braine caused by melancholy may be cured taken away and cut off by meanes of physicke but the distresse of conscience cannot be cured by any thing in the world but one and that is the blood of christ and the assurance of god fauour fourthly the way to cure melancholy is this first the person troubled must be brought to this that he will content himselfe to be aduised and ruled by the iudgement of others and cease to rest vpon himselfe touching his owne estate and by this shall he reape much quiet and contentation secondly search and triall must be made whether he hath in him any beginnings of grace as of faith and repentance o no if he be a carnall man and wanteth knowledge of his estate then meanes must be vsed to bring him to some sight and sorrow for his sinnes that his melancholy sorrow may be turned into a godly sorrow if he want faith and true repentance some good beginnings thereof must be wrought in his heart thirdly when he is brought to faith in god mercie and an honest purpose not to sinne any more then certaine mercifull promises of god are to be laid before him and he must be exhorted to rest vpon these promises and at no time to admit any imagination or thought that may crosse the saide promises now the promises are these and such like psalm no good thing shall be wanting to them that feare god psalm no euill shall come neere the godly man chr the lord is with you while you are with him and if you seeke him he will be found of you iam draw neere to god and he will draw neere to you and the best meanes to cause any man thus diseased to be at peace with himselfe is to hold beleeue and know the truth of these promises and not to suffer any bythought to enter into his heart that may crosse them moreouer though the former promises may stay the mind yet will they not take away the humour except further helpe be vsed therefore the fourth and last helpe is the arte of physick which serues to correct and abate the humour because it is a meanes by the blessing of god to restore the health and to cure the distemper of the bodie and thus much touching the trouble of mind caused by melancholy the second meanes whereby the bodie annoies the minde is when it occasions trouble to the minde by strange alterations incident to the body when a man beginnes to enter into a phrensie if the braine admit neuer so little alteration presently the minde is troubled the reason corrupted the heart terrified the man distracted in the whole bodie thus from the trembling of the heart come many fearefull imaginations and conceits whereof a man knowes not the cause the same is procured by the swelling of the splene by the rising of the entrals by strange crampes convulsions and such like the remedie hereof is this first it is still to be considered whether the partie thus troubled hath the beginnings of true faith amp repentance or no if he hath it is so much the better if he hath not as vsually such persons are meere naturall man then the first dutie is to vse all meanes to stirre vp in him some godly sorrow for his sinnes to bring him to the exercises of inuocation and to some confidence in god mercy for pardon secondly this beeing done meanes must be vsed to take away the opinion conceiued which will be done by giuing him information of the state of his bodie and what is the true and proper cause of the alteratio therof this being knowne the griefe or feare conceiued will easily be staied for take away the false opinion and inform the iudgement and the whole man will be the better thirdly the opinion beeing altered and reformed it may be the alteration in the bodie will remaine the partie therefore in that case must be taught that it is a correction of god and that god doth not barely suffer the correction to be inflicted but is the very author of it and therefore the partie is to be well pleased and to rest himselfe in that will of god for euery present estate whether it be good or badde is the best state for vs because it comes by god will amp appointment and thus much touching the distinct kindes of distresses of minde whereunto i adde this one thing further that if we make examination of the estate of persons as are troubled with any of these fiue temptations we shall not vsually find them single but mixed together especially melancholy with terror of conscience or some other temptations for the distraction of the mind will often breed a distemper in the body and the distemper of the bodie likewise will sometimes cause distraction of mind again melancholy wil oftebe an occasion though no direct cause of terror of conscience amp in the same manner the conscience touched and terrified with sense of the haynousnesse of sinne and the heauinesse of god wrath will bring distemper of bodie by sympathy and cause melancholie in this case if question be made what is to be done i answere that for mixt distresses we must haue recourse to mixt remedies using in the first place the best meanes for the rectifying of the minde the principall growndes whereof haue beene before deliuered and then taking the seasonable aduise of the phisitian whose calling and seruice god hath sanctified for the cure and releefe of

reconciliation to manifest vnto man the pleasure of the highest to season the corrupted heart instrumentally vvith grac to inlighten the darkened minde by the dispensation of sauing knovvledge as the

minister yes of that importance as heretofore i haue declared to your lord it seemeth strange at least in my poore conceit that among so many graue and learned discourses published by vvay of

in the kingdome of glorie from eman coll in cambridge novemb of the order of the questions hitherto i haue spoken touching the first sort of questions of the conscience which concerne man simply considered in himselfe as he is a man in the next place come to be handled and resolued the questions concerning man as he stands in relation now man standing in a two fold relation either to god or to man according to this relation the questions come to be considered in their seuerall places and first we are to treat of the questions of conscience touching man standing in relation to god to wit as he is a christian all which for order sake may be reduced to foure heads of the godhead touching the godhead there are two maine questions before we come to answer the question this one caueat must be remembered that it is a maine ground and principle in all religions whatsoeuer not to be doubted of or called into question that there is a god heb he that commeth to god must beleeue that god is as for those that are commonly tearmed atheists which denie that there is a god they are to be punished with death as not worthie to liue in humane societie and the greatest torment that can be deuised by the witte of man is too good for them for if those be holden as traytors to an earthly prince and are most deseruedly adiudged to death that reuile his person and denie his lawful authoritie then they that call into question the godhead are much more worthie to be esteemed traytors to god and consequently to beare the iust punishment of their rebellion death it selfe for this cause i doe not meane to dispute the question whether there be a god or no and thereby minister occasion of doubting and deliberation in that which is the onely maine ground and pillar of christian religion but rather my purpose is in shewing that there is a god to remooue or at least to help an inward corruption of the soule that is great and dangerous whereby the heart and conscience by nature denieth god and his prouidence the wound in the bodie that plucks out the heart is the most dangerous wound that can be and that opinion that takes away the godhead doth in effect rend and plucke out the very heart of the soule this caueat premised i come now to the point in hand to shew that there is a god and for our better knowledge and assurance of this truth we are to remember thus much that god hath giuen vnto man a threefold light the one of nature the other of grace and the third of glorie and by these as by so many degrees of knowledge the minde beeing inlightened by god receiueth direction in the truth of the godhead both for this present life and for that which is to come if it be demaunded in what order god hath reveiled this light vnto man i answer that the light of nature serues to giue a beginning and preparation to this knowledge the light of grace ministers the ground and giues further proofe and euidence and the light of glory yeelds perfectio of assurance making that perfectly and fully knowne which by the former degrees was but weakly and imperfectly comprehended of these three in order the light of nature is that light which the view and consideration of the creatures both in generall and particular affordeth vnto man from the light of nature there are fiue distinct arguments to prooue that there is a god the consideration whereof will not be vnprofitable even to him that is best setled in this point i the first is taken from the creation and frame of the great body of the world and the things therein contained rom the inuisible things of him that is his eternall power and godhead are knowne by the creation of the world beeing considered in his workes and out of this excellent frame of the world the truth of the godhead may be sundry waies prooued and maintained first i would aske this question this goodly frame of the world had it a beginning or no beginning let either part or both be taken let it first be said it had no beginning but is eternall as the atheist holdeth then i reason thus if it had no beginning the world it selfe is god and all the creatures that are therein from the greatest and highest to the least and basest yes euery droppe of water in the sea and euery corne of sand by the sea shore are god the reason is because according to this opinion they haue their being of themselues without beginning and that which is a substance of it selfe amp hath no beginning is very god againe if the world had no beginning then it hath also no ending for that which is without beginning is without ending now all things in the world are lyable to corruption and consequently are subiect to an ende for whatsoeuer is corruptible the same is finite therfore the world had a beginning now if it had a beginning then i demand how it was made did it make it selfe or was it made of nothing if it be affirmed that it made it selfe then the world was before it was if it be said it came from nothing that also cannot be for nothing brings forth nothing and that which is nothing in it selfe cannot bring forth something therefore it is absurd in reason to say that nothing brought forth this world and hereupon it must needes remaine for a truth that there was some substance eternall and almightie that framed this goodly creature the world besides it selfe if a man comes into a large forrest and beholds therein goodly faire buildings and sundrie kinds of hearbs and trees and birds and beast and no man he will presently reason thus with himselfe these buildings are the workemanship of some man they were not from all eternity they did not reare themselues neither did the hearbs the trees the birds or the beast build them but of necessitie they must haue some first ounder which is man in like manner when we consider this world so goodly a creature to behold though we see not the maker thereof yet we cannot say that either it made it selfe or that the things therein contained made it but that the creator of it was some vncreated substance most wise most cunning and euerlasting and that is god secondly from this frame of the world and the consideration therof i reason thus in the world there are foure sorts and kindes of creatures the first bare and naked substances that haue neither life sense nor reason in them as the sun the moone the starres the second that haue substance and life but no sense nor reason as plants trees and hearbs the third that haue no reason but both substance life sense and power to mooue themselues as the beast of the land and fish of the sea the fourth are such as haue all namely substance life sense and reason as man now these foure sorts of creatures excell one another in properties and degrees for the first of them which are meere substances doe serue those that haue life as the trees and the plants the trees amp the plantes serue the creatures that haue sense amp life as the beastes and the fish the beastes and the fish serue man that hath substance life sense and reason and amongst them all we see that those which haue more gifts are serued of those which haue lesse as the sun and moone serue the plantes the plantes and hearbes serue the beast and the beast serue man and that creature that hath most giftes is serued of all man therefore excelling all these must haue something to honour and serue which must be more excellent then the other creatures yes then himselfe and that is a substance vncreate most holy most wise eternall infinite and this is god thirdly all particular creatures whether in heauen or in earth are referred to their certaine particular and peculiar endes wherein euery one of them euen the basest and meanest is imployed and which they doe all accomplish in their kind and this is a plaine proofe that there is one that excelleth in wisedome prouidence and power that created all these to such endes and hath power to bring them thereunto and who is this but god ii the second sort of arguments drawn from the light of nature are taken from the preseruation and gouernment of the world created and these are touched by the holy ghost when he saith that god left not himself without witnesse in that in his prouidence he did good and gaue raine from heauen and fruitfull seasons filling our hearts with ioy and gladnesse the particulars drawne from the gouernment of the world are these first our food whereby we are nourished is in it selfe a dead foode void of life and yet it serues to maintain and preserue life wheras in reason it is more fit to choke and stuffe our body then to feede them secondly our garments which we weare are in themselues cold and voide of heate and yet they haue this vse to preserue heate and to sustaine life in the extremitie of cold therefore there must needes be an omnipotent and diuine power that giues vnto them both such a vertue to feed and preserue the life and health of man thirdly the raine falling and the sun shining vpon one amp the same plot of groud causeth it to bring forth in his season a hundred seuerall kindes of hearbes and plants wherof euery one hath a seuerall and distinct ower colour forme and sauour whence comes this not from the raine for it hath no life in it selfe and besides it is in it selfe all one nor from the sun or the earth for these also in their kind are all one hauing in them no such power wherby they should be the authors of life therefore the differences of plants in one ground may convince our iudgements and teach vs thus much that there is a diuine and heauenly power aboue and beside the power of these creatures fourthly take an example of the bird and the egge the bird brings forth the egge the egge againe brings forth the bird this egge considered in it selfe hath in it neither life nor soule and the bird can giue it neither for all that the bird can doe is to giue it heat and no more within the shell of this egge is made a goodly creature which whe it comes to some perfection it breakes the shell in the shell broken we shall see the nibbe the wing the legge and all the parts and members of a bird now let this be considered that the egge brought not forth this goodly creature nor yet the henne for the egge had no such power or vertue in it selfe and the hen gaue but her heat neither did man doe it for that which was done was within the egge and within the shell it therfore was some other wonderfull power and wisedome that made it and brought it forth that surpasseth the power of a creature again consider the generation of the silkworme one of the least of the creatures and from it we haue a notable demonstration of a divine providence this little worme at the first is but a small seede like vnto linseed the same small seed breeds it and brings it forth the worme brought forth and growing to some bignesse at length weaues the silk hauing woven the silk it winds it selfe within it as it were in a shell there hauing lodged for a time it conceiues a creature of another forme which being within a short space p rfited breakes the shell and comes forth a flie the same flie like a dutifull creature brings forth the seed againe and so continues the kind thereof from yeare to yeare here let it be remembred that the flie hauing once brought forth the seede leaues it and dies immediately and yet the seede it selfe though exposed to wind and weather and vtterly neglected of man or any creature at a certaine time within few moneths becomes a worm whece should al this proceede but from a creator infinitely powerfull and wise who by his admirable power and prouidence dispenseth life beeing and propagation euen to the least things in their particular sorts and kinds iii the third sort of arguments from th light of nature are taken from the soule of man this soule is endued with excellent gifts of vnderstanding and reason the vnderstanding hath in it from the beginning certaine principles whereby it knowes and discernes good and bad things to be done and things to be left vndone now man cannot haue this gift to discerne between good and euill of or from himselfe but it must needes proceede from another cause which is power wisedome and vnderstanding it selfe and that is god againe the conscience another gift of the soule of man hath in it two principall actions testimony and iudgement by both which the trueth in hand is evidently confirmed touching the testimonie of conscience let it be demaunded of the atheist whereof doth conscience beare witnesse he cannot denie but of all his particular actions i aske then against whome or with whome doth it giue testimony the aswer wil easily be made by the heart of any man that it is with or against himselfe furthermore to whome is it a witnes neither to man nor to angels for it is vnpossible that any man or angel should either heare the voice of cosciece or receiue the testimonie thereof or yet discerne what is in the heart of man hereupon it followes that there is a substance most wise most powerfull most holy that sees and knowes all things to whome conscience beares record and that is god himselfe and touching the iudgement of conscience let a man commit any trespasse or offence though it be done in secret and concealed from the knowledge of any person liuing yet conscience that knoweth it will accuse him terrifie him cite him before god and giue him no rest what or where is the reason man knowes not the trespasse committed and if there be no god whome shall he feare and yet he feares this also necessarily prooueth that there is a iust and mightie god that will take vengeance vpon him for his sinne iv the fourth argument from nature is this there is a ground or principle written in euery mans heart in the world none excepted that there is a god reasons for proofe hereof may be these first the gentiles worshipping idoles made of stocks and stones doe acknowledge herein thus much that there is something whereunto honour and seruice is due for man by nature is proud and will neuer yeeld to bow the knee of his bodie before a stocke or a stone to adore it vnlesse he thinke and acknowledge that there is in them a diuine power better then himselfe secondly the oath that is taken for confirmation commonly tearmed the assertorie oath is vsed in all country and it is for the most part generally taken to be a lawful meanes of confirming a mans word when it is bound by the oath taken iacob and laban beeing to make a couenant iacob sweares by the true god laban by his false god and by that both were bound to stand to their agreement and not to goe backe therefore neither of them did or durst breake their oath and among the gentiles themselues there are fewe or none to be found that will falsifie their word giuen and auowed by oath whereupon it is a cleare case that they acknowledged a godhead which knowes and discernes their hearts yes that knowes the truth and can and will plague them for disgracing the truth by lying thirdly we are not lightly to passe ouer the vsuall tearmes and ordinarie speech of all nation who are woont vpon occasion to say it raines it thunders it snowes it hailes for saying this one while they reioyce and are thankefull otherwhiles they feare and are dismaied they say not nature or heauen raines or thunders for then they would neither reioyce nor tremble in that therefore they speake this commonly sometimes reioycing sometimes fearing it may probably be thought that they acknowledge a diuine power which causeth the raine to fall and the thunder to be so terrible againe for better proofe hereof it is to be considered that since the world began there could not yet be found or brought forth any man that euer wrote or published a discourse more or lesse to this purpose that there was no god if it be said that some history doe make mention of sundrie that haue in plaine tearmes denied there is a god and that this is no lesse daungerous then if a treatise of that subiect should be written and set forth to the open view of all i answer indeede in the writings of man we doe read of some that blasphemed god and liued as without god and they haue alwaies beene properly and deseruedly tearmed atheists others haue denied that made and faigned god that is idols are god and amongst the heathen that liued onely by the light and direction of nature all that can be brought is this that some man in their writings haue doubted whether there were a god or no but none did euer positiuely set downe reasons to prooue that there was none v the fifth and last argument from nature is that which is vsed by all philosophers in the world there is to be seene an excellent wise frame and order of all things one creature depends vpon an other by a certaine order of causes in which some are first and aboue in higher place some are next and inferiour some are the basest and the lowest now these lowest are mooued of those that are superiour to them and alwaies the superiour is the cause of the inferiour and that whereof the inferiour depends something then there must be that is the cause of all causes that must be caused by none and must be the cause of all for in things wherein there is order there is alway some first and soueraigne cause and where there is no first nor last there the creatures are infinite but seeing all creatures are finite there must be somewhat first as well as last now the first and the last cause of all is god which mooueth all and to whome all creatures doe tend as to their ende and which is mooued of none notwithstanding all these reasons grounded in nature it selfe it may be some man wil say i neuer saw god how then shall i know that there is a god ans why wilt thou beleeue no more then thou seest thou neuer sawest the winde or the aire and yet thou beleeuest that there is both nay thou neuer sawest thine owne face but in a glasse and neuer out of a glasse and yet this contenteth thee why then may not this content thy heart and resolue thee of the godhead in that thou seest him in the glasse of the creatures true it is that god is a spirit inuisible that cannot be discerned by the eie of flesh and blood yet he hath not left vs without a meanes whereby we may behold him for looke as we are woont by degrees to goe from the picture to the painter and in the picture to behold the painter himselfe euen so by the image of god written as it were in the face and other parts of the creatures in the world may we take a view of the wisdome power and prouidence of the creator of them all who is god himselfe and these are the principall proofes of the godhead which are reuealed in the booke of nature the second ground of proofes is taken from the light of grace and it is that light which god affordeth to his church in the writings of the prophets and apostles and this giues a further confirmation then nature doth for the light of nature is onely a way or preparation to faith but this light serues to beget faith and causeth vs to beleeue there is a god now in the scriptures of the prophets and apostles we shall see amongst the rest three distinct proofes of this point first expresse testimonies that doe in plaine tearmes note vnto vs the godhead secondly expresse prophecies and reuelations of things to come euen many hundred and thousands of yeares before they came to passe yes things that are to come are foretold in the word of god so and in that very manner that they shall be in the time wherein they are to be fulfilled now there is no man able of himselfe to know or foresee these things to come therefore this knowledge must rest in him alone who is most wise that perfectly vnderstandeth and beholdeth things that are not and to whom all future things are present and therefore certain thirdly the word of god reuealeth many miracles which doe exceede and surpasse whole nature yes all naturall causes the doing and working whereof is not in the power of any meere creature in the world as for example the making of the sun against his naturall course to stand still in the firmament of the water which are naturally flowing to stand as a wall and the bottome of the sea to be as drie land the maine ende whereof is to shew that there is an absolute and almightie power which is the author of nature it selfe and all naturall things and ordereth both it and them according to his pleasure the third ground of proofes is fetched from the light of glorie and this is that light which god affords vnto his servant after this life ended in the kingdome of heauen wherein all imperfection of knowledge being taken away they shal see god face to face and haue a full and perfect knowledge of the godhead to this purpose the apostle saith that in the world we know in part amp we see as it were in a glasse the coparison is worth the marking for there he compareth our knowledge of god that we haue in this life to a dimme sighted man that can see either very little or nothing at all without his spectacles and such is our sight amp comprehension of god darke and dimme in that we cannot behold him as he is but onely as he hath manifested himselfe vnto vs in and through the glasse of the word and sacraments and by the spectacles of his creatures but the time will come when the skales of our eies shall be washed off and they shall be made as cleare as cristall when the imperfection and weaknes of our vnderstanding shall be cleane remooued and then we shall be inabled to see god clearely and fully face to face thus the first question is answered that there is a god by propounding this question as in the former i meane not to make a doubt touching the godhead of christ which is one of the principall groundes of our religion but to take away or at least preuent an inward corruption of the heart in the that are weake in knowledge whereby they may be brought sometimes to make doubt and question of the diuinitie of christ and therefore haue neede to be resolued in the truth hereof now for the proofe of this point that christ is god i will lay downe these grounds i the summe amp substance of the bible is to conclude that iesus the son of mary is the son of god and the redeemer of mankinde and it may be concluded in this syllogisme he that shall come of the seede of abraham and dauid and in time shall be borne of a virgin that shall preach the gladtidings of the gospell satisfie the law offer vp an oblation of himselfe for the sinnes of them that beleeue ouercome death by his death and resurrection ascend into heauen and in fulnesse of time come againe to iudge both the quicke and the dead is the true messias and sauiour of the world but iesus of nazareth the son of marie is he in whome alone all these things shall come to passe therfore he onely is the true messias and sauiour of the world the proposition or first part of the argument is laid downe in the old testament the assumption or second part in the new the conclusion is the question in hand the scope and drift of them both ii ground in daniel it was prophecied that after the time of weekes that is yeares the messias should be exhibited by which prophecie it is manifest that the messias is alreadie come into the world for from that time till now there are at the least yeares as may plainly be seene by humane history and by the motions and course of the heauens it is also plaine from hence that hauing bene exhibited and come in the flesh he hath made satisfaction by his death to the wrath of god for sinne hence it followes that he is the very true messias and redeemer of the world because from that time there was neuer any to whome this title and the forenamed properties might so truly agree as to this iesus the son of dauid iii ground iesus the son of mary did teach professe and dispute that he was god that he and his father were one and he tooke vnto himselfe the honour of god ioh and an evident argument that he was so as he professed and preached himselfe to be for neuer any creature chalenged to himselfe the honour of god falsly but was discouered and confounded adam for affecting and aspiring to it was cast out of paradise and herod for it died miserably act and diverse popes are recorded in ecclesiasticall stories to haue taken this honour vnto themselues and there was neuer any sort of man in the world that had more fearfull iudgments vpon them then they but christ chalenged this to himselfe and prospered and god did most seuerely reuenge his death both vpon herod and pilate as also vpon the iewes and emperours of rome that persecuted the church iv ground christ while he was on earth before he ascended into heauen promised his disciples to send his spirit vnto them so to assist them that they should be able to do greater works then himselfe did ioh ampc now whe christ was ascended the euent was strange and yet fully answerable to his promise for the disciples were but fewe twelue in number and all vnlearned and yet they preached in the name of christ and by bare preaching without humane eloquence and the giftes of nature conuerted many nation yes the whole world and though themselues were but weake man and preached things absurd to the corrupt reason of man yet they wonne many soules to god and conuerted the world v ground is borrowed from the testimony of the heathen who haue recorded in their writings the very samethings touching christ which are reuealed in the scriptures iosephus a iew and an enemie to christ in his eight booke of antiquities chap speakes the same things of christ that mathew doth that he was a most worthy man that he wrought many miracles and that he rose from the dead others affirme that he was crucified vnder pilate in the time of tiberius and that tiberius would haue put him in the number of his god againe heathen writers report that at his death vnder the raigne of tiberius all the oracles of the world ceased and the great god pan as they say then died of the scriptures the answere is that they are and the grounds of this assertion may be reduced to sixe heades the first is taken from the causes namely the author and writers of the scriptures touching the author the scripture referreth it selfe vnto god therfore he alone is the true and vndoubted author thereof and none but he the sufficiencie of this consequence stands vpon these grounds first if god were not the author of scriptures there would be no one booke in the earth so fabulous and so full of errour as it which to say is blasphemy for it speakes such things as neuer any could speake but god secondly if it were not the booke of god then all god will should be hidden and god should neuer yet haue reuealed his will to man thirdly if it had not beene the word of god the falshood therof would haue beene detected long agone for there hath beene nothing falsly said of god at any time which he himselfe hath not at some time or other opened and reuealed euen as he did detect and discouer the falshood of the false prophet hanan ier and god heauie hand no doubt would long since haue beene vpon the ministers and preachers of this word if they had vniustly and wrongfully fathered it vpon him againe for the writers and penmen of scripture moses the prophets and apostles in their writings doe not set forth their own glory nobility or vertues but all with one consent haue acknowledged directly and plainely their owne errors and faults yes such faults as may be disgracefull to themselues and their posteritie and yet they haue done it a plaine proofe that they were not carried by policie and naturall reason but were holy man guided by the holy ghost for if they had beene guided by reason they would neuer haue written that which would haue tended to their owne disgrace but would rather haue comended theselues their name stocke and linage againe humane authors in their discourses doe commonly write of the praises and vertues of man of whome they write but the penmen of scripture with one consent giue all to god yes when they speake of commendation due to man thy giue it all to god in man god is in their writings the beginning the ende amp all a second head of reasons is taken from the matter and contents of the scriptures which are manifold the principall are these first the scripture doth that which no other bookes can doe for it sets out the corruption of mans nature by sinne the fountaine of this corruption amp the punishment of the same both in this life and the life to come it discouereth sinnefull mans particular thoughts lusts and affections which neuer any book hath don beside it no philosopher was euer able to make so true record and so plaine declaration of the thoughts motions and affections of the heart the reason of man cannot discerne them by nature vnles it receiue a further light by grace then it hath naturally in it selfe yes the scripture sets downe things that no mans heart can imagine amp yet are true by experiece for example that it is an euill thought to thinke there is no god ma by nature canot imagine but yet it is true in experience amp by the light of the word and therefore dauid saith the foole hath saide in his heart there is no god secondly the maine contents of this booke are sundrie articles of faith all which are farre aboue the reach of humane reason and yet they are not against it but at least some of them may be prooued by it for example that there is a redeemer of the world is an article of faith aboue reason yet not against the same for in naturall vnderstanding god is not all iustice and no mercie but if there were no redeemer then should god be all iustice without mercie now because he hath reuealed himselfe to be as well mercifull as he is iust reason concludes there is a redeemer againe that this redeemer should be god and man is aboue reason yet not against it for reason teacheth he must be god that he might satisfie the infinite iustice of god for sinne which none but god can doe againe that he must be man because man hauing sinned man must be punished for the sinne of man thirdly in the scripture there are sundrie predictions made before hand particularly which notwithstanding were not to come to passe till an yeares after amp all these predictions in the same manner as they haue bin foretold haue bin fulfilled iacob in his will foretold that the scepter should not depart from iudah till shiloh that is the messias came this was verified euen as it was foretold for a little before christs birth the scepter was taken from the iewes and translated vnto the romane empire and herod put the whole colledge of the iewes called their sanedrim to the sword in which colledge was the heire apparent of the kings blood againe balaam number foretold that kittim that is the grecians and the romans should subdue eber the people of the east and that also was afterward verified for the hebrewes and assyrians were afterward ouercome by the grecians and cilicians the apostle paul in his time foretold the destruction of the romane empire and the reuealing of antichrist thes ampc which prophecie was shortly after fulfilled for antichrist grew from those times by little and little till at length he came to sit in the emperours throne man indeede may foretell things to come but things foretold by them are present in their causes and so they know and foretell them not otherwise but god foretelleth simply and the scriptures foretell simply therefore they are the word of god fourthly the law a part of the scripture is propounded most purely amp perfectly without exception or limitation whereas in all mens lawes some sinnes are condemned but some be tolerated and permitted but in god law euery sinne is condemned amp none either forborne or excused lastly the style and speech of the scripture is plaine and simple without affectation and yet full of grace and maiestie for in that simple style it commandeth the whole man bodie and soule it threatneth euerlasting death and promiseth euerlasting life and it doth more affect the heart of man then all the writings in the world whatsoeuer the third reason to induce vs to receiue the scriptures as the word of god is taken from the effects whereof i note onely two i the doctrine of scripture in the law and specially in the gospel is contrarie to the corrupt nature of man whereupon paul saith the wisdome of the flesh is enmitie against god and yet the same word beeing preached by the minister appointed by god conue teth nature and turnes the heart of man vnto it in such sort as in this last age it hath wonne a great part of the world to the imbracing thereof now in reason this is impossible that a thing which is so flat against mans corrupt nature should notwithstading preuaile with it so farre as to cause man to liue and die in the profession amp maintenance thereof wee are woont to reiect the writings of man if they please not our humors whereas this word of god is of force to mooue and cline our affections though neuer so much censured crossed and controlled by it and this shewes that god is the author thereof from whome the word of creation came to which euery thing at the first yeelded obedience ii the word of god hath this effect to be able to minister comfort and releefe in all distresses of bodie or minde yes in the greatest and most desperate troubles and vexations of the conscience and when the helpes of humane learning and philosophie which are of great vse and force in other cases haue done all that they can to the very vtmost without effect or successe euen then the sweete promises of the gospel will reuiue and raise vp the heart and giue it full contentment and satisfaction expetience shewes this to be a confessed truth in particular cases and it teacheth whence and fro whome this word proceedeth wherein these promises are contained namely from god for when he sets the conscience vpon the racke the word that releeueth and refresheth the same must needs proceede and come from him alone the fourth reason is taken from the properties of scripture i will name onely two the first is antiquitie which most plainly appeares in the historie though the doctrine it selfe be as ancient the scripture contains a continued historie from age to age for the space of yeares before christ euen from the beginning humane history that are of any certentie or continuance begin onely about the time of ezra and nehemiah as for those which were written before they are onely fragments and of no certentie the second propertie is consent with it selfe in all parts both for the matter scope and ende the writings of man doe dissent from themselues by reason of ignorance amp forgetfulnes in the authors but the word of god agrees with it selfe most exactly and the places that seeme to disagree may easily be reconciled which shewes that holy man by whome it was penned were not guided therein by their owne priuate iudgement but were directed by the wisdome of the spirit of god the fift reason is drawne from the contraries the deuill and wicked man are in iudgement and disposition as contrarie to scripture as light is to darkenes i prooue it thus let a man read any booke of philosophie and labour to be resolued of any one point therein he shall neuer be tempted to infidelitie but if the same man reade the bookes of scripture and labour to vnderstand them he shall haue within himselfe many motions and temptations not to beleeue and obey it now what should be the cause thereof but that these bookes are the word of god which the deuill laboureth to oppugne with might and maine againe consider the same in the practise of wicked man they will not brooke the rebuke of their sinnes namely their idolatry blasphemie and other notorious crimes by scripture but will seeke the blood and life of him that shall sharply taxe and reprooue them and hence it was that wicked kings so persecuted the lord prophets yes further let it be marked that these wicked man that are tainted with these horrible crimes and cannot abide the word nor teachers thereof to the death haue commonly fearefull endes now the opposition of satan and wicked man to the word shewes the scriptures to be a most holy word and indeede the very word of god the sixt reason is taken from sundrie testimonies first of holy martyrs in the olde and new testament who haue giuen their liues for the maintenance of this word and sealed the same with their owne hearts blood yes suffered the most horrible and exquisite torments that the wit of man could deuise and that most patiently and willingly not beeing daunted or dismaied the stories of martyrs in all ages confirme this truth especially of those that suffered before in and after the times of the tenne bloodie persecutions and vnlesse they had beene supported by a d ine power in so good a cause they could neuer so many of them haue suffered in such manner as they did the second is the testimonie and consent of heathen man who haue recorded the very same things at l ast many of the principall that are set downe in the bible if this were not so man should haue some colourable excuse of his vnbeleefe and these things which they record were not all taken out of the scripture but were registred to memorie by historiographers that liued in the times when they were done such are the stories of the creation and flood of the tower of babel of the arke of abraham and his possessions of circumcision of the miracles of moses of the birth of christ and the slaughter of the young children of the miracles of christ of the death of herod agrippa and such like and these we take for true in humane stories much more then ought we to doe it in the word of god the third testimonie is of miracles the octrine of scripture was confirmed by miracles wrought by the teachers thereof the prophets and apostles aboue all power amp strength of nature and such as the deuill can not counterfeit as the staying of the sun and the raising of the dead ampc the fourth is the testimonie of the holy ghost which is the argument of all arguments to settle and resolue the conscience and to seale vp the certaintie of the word of god if any shall aske how this testimony of the holy ghost may be obtained and beeing obtained how we may discerne it to be the testimony of the holy ghost and not of man i answer by doing two things first by resigning our selues to become truly obedient to the doctrine taught ioh if any man will doe my fathers will saith christ he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god secondly by praying vnto god for his spirit to certifie our consciences that the doctrine reveiled is the doctrine of god aske faith our sauiour christ amp it shal be giuen you seeke and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened vnto you for he that asketh rece eth mat againe your heauenly father will giue the holy ghost to them that desire him luke and if any man lacke wisdome let him aske it of god who giueth to all man liberally and reprocheth no man and it shall be giuen him iam now hauing set down the proofes of this point before i come to the next question some speciall obiections against this doctrine are to be answered and resolued for there haue not beene wanting in all ages both atheists and others who haue professedly excepted against it and of set purpose haue vndertaken to call the written word of god into question such were celsus lucian iulian porpherie apelles and others from whome some of latter times hauing receiued the poison of atheisme and prophanesse haue not ceased as much as in them lyeth to oppugne sundry parts and portions of holy scripture their principall reasons and exceptions i will propound and answere one by one and first they except against that which is written gen where it is said god made the sun the fourth day now say they the sun is the cause of the day and therefore there could not be three daies before the sun was created considering that the effect is not before the cause but the cause before the effect i answere first we must put a difference betweene cause and cause for of causes some be the highest some subordinate vnto them the highest and first cause of all creatures is god himselfe from whom all things at the first immediately flowed without any relation to their causes in nature and thus were the first second and third daies created and appointed immediately from god and distinguished from the night by an intercourse of light ordained by him for that purpose but the subordinate and inferior cause of the day in order of nature was the sun and that by the same appointment of god and this cause was not set in nature as the cause of the day before the fourth day of creation for then it pleased him to make it his instrument to distinguish the day from the night as also for other ends and vses and therfore it is no marueile though the day was created before the sun the instrumentall cause thereof considering that it was created before the sun was set in the heauen by the creatour himselfe secondly we must distinguish of times which are either of creation or gouernment and there is one regard to be had of things while they were in making and another after they were created now it is true the sun is the cause of the day and the night in the time of the gouernment of the world but it was not so in the time of the first making of all things for in the three first daies of the world there was day and night without the sun by a vici itude of light and darkenes which the lord made and nature could neuer haue found out had not the word reuealed it but since the creation in the time of gouernment the sun is but an instrument appointed by god to cary light and he that made the light can now in the gouernment of the world if it pleased him put downe the sun from this office and by some other meanes distinguish the day from the night therefore no marueile though he did so in the beginning the second obiection is touching the light of the moone moses saith it is one of the great lights which god made now say they in all reason according to humane learning it is one of the least of the planets and lesse then many starres answer it is true which the holy ghost saith by moses and yet the moone is lesse then the sun yes then many of the starres for one and the same starre in a diverse and different respect may be tearmed greater and less and in that place the scripture speaks of the moone not in regard of other starres greater then it but in respect of our se se because it appeareth greater in quantitie and really communicateth more light yes it is of more operation and vse to the earth then any of the starres in the heauen sauing the sun the third obiection moses saith man amp beast were made of the earth and fish of the water but all humane learning auoucheth that the matter of euery creature consisteth of all the foure elements earth water fire and re ans moses speaketh onely of two which were the principall and in them includes the other because they are impure amp mixt with the other since the fall againe some learned auouch that all creatures are made of earth amp water only as being the two maine materiall principles of the all and not of ayre nor of fire and this accords with moses and is no doubt a truth that he speaks onely of the principall matter of these creatures amp yet the fire and ayre are and may be called elements or beginnings because they serue to forme preserue and cherish the creatures the fourth obiection gen it is said that eue before her fall was deceiued by the serpent now this saith the atheist is absurd for euen in the estate of corruption since the fall there is no woman so simple that will either admit speech or suffer her selfe to be deceiued by a serpent much lesse would eue in the estate of her innocencie answer though adam and eue in their innocencie had excellent knowledge yet they had not all knowledge for then they should haue beene as god himselfe but in that estate ignorance befell eve in three things for first though adam himselfe was a prophet in the time of his innocencie yet both he and shee were ignorant of the issue of future things which are contingent secondly they knewe not the secrets of each others heart for to know the euent of things contingent certainely and the secrets of the heart belongs to god only thirdly though eue knew the kinds of creatures yet shee knew not all particulars and all things that were incident to euery kind of creature but was to attain vnto that knowledge by experience and obseruation neither may this seeme strange for christ as he was man had as much yes more knowledge then our first parents had in their innocence and yet he knew not all particulars in all singular creatures for seeing a figtree by the way as he went to ierusalem he thought it had borne fruit and yet comming towards it he found none thereon and in like manner eue might know the serpentine kind and yet be ignorant whether a serpent could speake besides that the naming of the creatures which argues knowledge of them was not giuen to eue but to adam and therefore it was not so strange that eue should be deceiued by a serpent considering that to know that a serpent could speake or not speake came by experience which shee then had not i will be said that all ignorance is sinne but eue had no sinne and therefore shee could not be ignorant answer ignorance is twofold some ignorance ariseth of an euill disposition when as we are ignorant of those things which we are bound to knowe and this is sinne properly but there is another ignorance which is no sinne when as we are ignorant of those things which we are not bound to know and this was in christ for he was ignorant of the figtrees bearing fruit and he knew not the day of iudgement as he was man and this also was in eue not the other the fift obiection is about the arke gen god commaunded noah to make an arke of cubits long of cubits broad and of cubits high this arke saith the atheist beeing so small a vessell could not possibly containe two of euery sort of creatures with their foode for the space of a yeare the first author of this cauill was apelles the hereticke that cauilled with christians about the arke and the answer is as ancient as the heresie namely first that the cubit of the arke must be vnderstood of the egyptian cubit which is with some sixe foote and with others nine foote by which measure the arke would be in legth half a mile at the least and by this means any man may see a possibility in reason that the arke might containe and preserue all creatures with their fodder and roome to spare the second answere is that as the iewes had a shekle of the sanctuary which was greater then the ordinary shekle so they had beside the ordinary cubit a sacred cubit the cubit of the sanctuary where of mention is made in the prophecie of ezekiel chap and that was bigger by the halfe then the ordinarie cubite and by this measure some say the arke was made but both these answeres are onely coniecturall without good ground in the scripture to them therefore i adde a third in the daies of noah the stature of man was farre bigger then it is at this day and looke as the stature of man was great and large so was the cubite proportionall therto containing the length of the arme from the elbow to the longest fingers end and this beeing considered that the arke was built by that measure and not by the ordinary cubit as it is now it will appeare that the atheist hath greatly deceiued himselfe and abused that part of god word that declares the storie of the arke againe the length of this vessell beeing cubits it is plaine that it was fiue times the length of salomons temple which contained onely cubits the breadth beeing it was twise and a halfe the breadth of that which was but broad besides that it is to be remembred that in the arke were three lofts or stories one aboue another whereof each contained cubits in height and a chamber or flore of square measure cubits as for the creatures that were put into it the fowles of the ayre though they were of many sorts yet the biggest fort of them beeing the eagle and his kind they could not take vp any very large place for their residence the water creatures as some foules the fish ampc kept the water and were not lodged in the arke and the beast of the earth such beeing excluded as were bredde either by accidentall generation as mules or by putrefaction as serpents and other creeping things which might afterward be restored in other creatures that were preferued though for multitude and greatnes they excelled the rest yet as some write there are of them in all not aboue an distinct kinds and though there were as many more not knowne yet in probabilitie they could not be either many or great and of those that are great there are thought not to be aboue kinds now though it be graunted that there were in the arke distinct kinds of beast yet this number compared with the roome it will easily appeare that there might be allotted to euery kinde in one onely storie square cubits which in all likelihood might well suffice them all one with an other specially seeing all were not of an equall greatnes and therefore some might haue that or more space and some lesse all these things duly considered the vessell beeing of such capacitie might coprehend all those beast and many more together with their prouision for a longer time then a yeare other doubts touching this historie of lesse moment i omit and passe to the next the sixt allegation is out of gen where ismael is said to mocke at isaac when he was wained at which time ismael was fifteene yeares of age at the least for he was borne when abraham was yeare olde gen and isaac was borne when abraham was about a hundred gen both which put together make yeares whereto one yeare beeing added before isaac was wained makes vp the age of ismael as before and yet afterward in that chapter v hagar is saide to carrie the child in her armes and to cast him vnder a tree when he and his mother were cast out of abrahams house which argues him to haue beene but a little child whereas before he was said to be yeares olde ans a foolish cauill which blind atheists doe draw from the errour of some translation for the text is plaine that ismael with his mother hagar by reason of extreame heate and drought was almost dead wandering in the wildernes of beersheba and beeing in this extremitie shee caried him not but v led him in her hand and set him downe vnder a tree and there left him to die for in those cuntries man for want of water were at death dore as we may see in the example of sisera iudg and sampson chap the seauenth allegation gen iudah iosephs brother calls his brother beniamin a lad or a boy send the boy with me ampc and yet this lad saith the atheist the yeare following when he wet down into egypt with iacob his father is saide to haue ten childre gen how can these two stand together ans this cauili a iseth from the grosse ignorance of the atheist in the originall text for beniamin is called jeled which word commonly signifies a child but sometimes also a young man thus ismael that was yeares old is called jeled a lad gen and so gen lamech saith i will stay a man in my wound and jeled or a young man in my hurt that is if a man should wound me and a young man hurt me i would slay him now it is not like that a child could hurt laniech neither must this seeme strange for the most valiant man that dauid and ishbosheth had are called hannegna im the boyes of abner amp ioab sam and the like phrase is vsed in other languages for the grecians doe call young man by the name of and the latines by the name of pueri boyes or children the eight allegation exod it is saide v that all the water in egypt were turned into blood by moses and aaron and yet v it is saide that the magitians of egypt turned water into blood also which seemes to imply an absurditie considering that all the water were turned into blood before ans some answer thus that the water which the magitians turned was newly digged out of new pits and therefore they vnderstand the former of all the water that were seene and that they onely were turned into blood others answer more fitly that the water which the magitians changed were fetched out of goshen from amongst the israelites where the water remained pure and were not turned as the other were either of these answers may satisfie but specially the latter the inth allegation exod moses saith that all the beast in egypt died of the mu and yet v in the seventh plague it is said the beast were killed with thunder and haile and lightening both which cannot be true ans first we must put a difference between a common plague or iudgement and an vniuersall a common plague is when o sort or kinde s apeth but all sorts are smitten and such was the murren for no mans cattell were free no kind of cattell were saued but the vniuersall is when no particular of any kinde is exempted but all destroied such was not this plague but some escaped and were reserued for other iudgements that followed the ground of this distinction is this the word all in scripture is often taken indefinitely for many thus the prophet esay speaks cap from moneth to moneth and from saboth to saboth shall all flesh come to worship before me that is many or great multitudes and so in the new testament matth christ healed all diseases that is many and of all kinds some and in like manner the text before alleadged must not be taken generally to include all without exception but indefinitely for many or the most part of the cattell that were in the land of egypt the tenth allegation exod wee read that one of the plagues was a palpable darknes and so great that for three daies together no man either saw an other or rose vp from the place where he sate and yet v moses is sent for and called to come before pharaoh how should this be seeing no man could stirre from his place nor haue any light to goe before him for there was none to be had the darkenes was so palpable and the aire was so thicke ans i take it the word then v is to be meant thus that pharaoh sent for moses after the darkenes was ended not by candle or or other light in the time of darkenes and this answer may very well stand without further exception the eleuenth allegation iudg the atheists make a mocke at the historie of sampson as fabulous where it is said that all the philistims came together in one house to make sport with him and on the roofe sate about persons to beholde him while he plaied and yet there were but two pillars whereupon the whole house stood and those also standing in the midst so neere together that a man might reach them both with his armes this say they is most absurd and impossible ans although the full resolution of this cauill belongs to them that haue skill in architecture yet thus much may be faide in way of answer that the house might be capable of so many persons and they also that stood aboue might well see and behold sampson for first the whole house was not sustained by two pillars onely but by many more whereof two were the principall for in likelihood the middle part whereon the whole building was knit together from the bottome to the toppe beeing the weightiest of all was supported by two master pillars the other which was more outward and lesse weightie might be vpholden by less proppes which artificers in that kinde call by the name of false pillars hence it appeareth that the two maine ones standing so nigh together beeing shaken the whole house together with them must needes fall neither will this seeme strange that two pillars should beare vp a building of such capacitie if we doe but consider what is recorded of curio the romance who deuised the frame of a great amphitheater the two parts whereof were supported onely by two hinges and yet was so large that it contained the whole people of rome secondly old buildings in those country were made for the most part with open roofe againe they were full of windowes on euery part like vnto great gates and that they might be the more fit for sight from aboue they were reared vp in some sort after the manner of the egyptian pyramides wider below and narrower aboue towardes the top and by this meanes it is probable not onely that they might containe a great company but that all those which stoode about the sides and vpon the roofe might very well behold what sampson did below specially considering that he stood in the middest of the theater betweene the two middle pillars the twelfth allegation sam ampc it is saide that dauid plaied before saul and that saul knew him but chap when he was to fight with goliah saul knew him not here is a plaine contradiction in the atheists iudgement ans this sort of man doe still bewray their grosse ignorance both in the matter and in the order of scripture for the word of god doth not alway set downe things as they follow in order of time iust one after an other but sometime it doth anticipate putting such things in former history as are alreadie done and accomplished which in regard of their euent should be related afterward sometime againe it vseth by recapitulation to declare things as following in order of time which doe properly belong to a former narration an example of the latter to omit many other that might be brought is the text alleadged for that part of the chap from the v to the ende should by order of historie follow the as will easily appeare by comparing the place and the like displacing of things saide and done is else where to be found in the scriptures which beeing considered the atheists supposed contradiction falls to the ground for dauid was to fight with goliah before he plaied before saul and though he was then not knowne yet saul after that time tooke better knowledge of him the thirteenth allegation is out of chronicle where the papist plaies the right atheist in going about to improoue the originall copies there saith he iehosaphat is called king of israel when as indeede he was king of iudah and so is he called in the former booke of chronicles in like manner ahaz is tearmed king of israel chronicle whereas the truth is he was king of iudah answer after the death of salomon the kingdome was deuided and the ten tribes were called israel and the other two iudah and beniamin did beare the name of iudah now after the diuision for some time the name of israel common to both sides was giuen to either and both were named after it and in this respect iehoshaphat and ahaz may be termed kings of israel againe the name of israel sundry times in scripture and namely in the prophets is taken only for the two tribes which bare the name of iudah after the defection and thus also might ahaz haue that name given vnto him though he were king of iudah furthermore the word israel is sometimes put for a true worshipper of god that is for him that is a iew not without but within not in the letter but in the spirit rom thus our sauiour saith of nathaniel ioh behold a true israelite in whome is no guile that is a man of an vpright hart that serueth god in spirit and in truth and in this sense iehoshaphat might be termed king of israel because he was a king and patrone of all true worshippers of god for euen then the israelites sorted themselues together and the godly among them came to liue vnder him in iudah though the distinction of the kingdomes did still remaine the fourteenth allegation is out of act where the papists and atheists alleadge the scripture to be contrary to it self in that there it saith abraham bought a field of emor when as gen the same field was bought by iacob ans some say that there is a fault because abrahams name is put for iacob yet not a fault of the bible but of them that wrote out the bible neither doth this diminish the authoritie of scripture though the penmen did erre and slippe in writing so long as we may find out the truth by scripture ans that this field was bought twice first by abraham and then afterward recouered by iacob that he might maintaine his fathers possession answer that abrahams name is here put for his posterity as israels name is otherwhere giuen to his children yes not only to his children but also to his fathers isaack amp and abraham for exod it is said the abode of the children of israel while they dwelt in egypt was yeares which cannot be true vnlesse the abode of abraham and isaack be therein included now if the name of the successour may be giuen to his auncestors much more may the name of the auncestors be giuen to the posteritie of religion the third question concerning man as he stands in relation to god is touching religion where it is demanded what is that religion that is due vnto the true god answer the name religion is not alwaies taken in one and the same sense for sometime it is vsed to signifie the whole bodie of doctrine reuealed in the written word that teacheth and prescribeth whatsoeuer is to be beleeued or practized as necessary to saluation otherwhiles it is put for the inward vertue of the mind where the same doctirne is beleeued and the duties therein required practised and performed to the maiestie of god and beeing thus taken it is called by the name of pietie or godlinesse in the scripture and in this second sense i take it in this place now religion or pietie hath two distinct parts the first is knowledge of god the second the worship of god these two are notably described by dauid in his last will and testament wherein he commends vnto salomon his son before all other things the care and ioue of religion and pietie the summe whereof he reduceth to these heades the knowledge of god and worship of god chronicle and thou salomon my son knowe thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind according to this difference of heades are the questions concerning religion to be distinguished and these are principally two first how god is to be knowne and then how he is to be worshipped for answer hereunto this ground is first to be laid that we must not neither can possibly knowe or conceiue god as he is in himselfe for god in himselfe is infinite and therefore incomprehensible in regard of vs but we are to conceiue him so as he hath amp doth reveale himselfe to vs in his creatures principally in his word the truth herof may appeare in this one example to alleadge no more when moses desired to see the glory amp maiestie of god for a further confirmation and assurance of his calling answer was made him by god that he could not see his face but he should see his back parts as he passed by him the meaning of this answer is that god would manifest his glorie vnto him by his effects by which as by a glympse or imperfect representation he might discern some part of his maiestie so farre forth as he was able in the infirmitie of flesh and blood to behold the same but the perfect and full sight thereof no creature was euer able to attain vnto it beeing reserued for the life to come when amp not before they shall see him as he is in himselfe face to face this ground beeing laid the full answer to the question i propound in foure rules i rule when we are to pray or to worship god we must not conceiue him in the forme of any earthly or heauenly bodily or spirituall creature whatsoeuer for thus not to conceiue him is a degree of conceiuing him aright ii rule god must be conceiued of vs not by his nature but by his attributes amp works by his attributes as that he is infinite in mercie iustice goodnes power ampc by his works of creation and gouernement of the world of redemption ampc thus the lord reuealed himselfe to moses exod i am hath sent me vnto you that is one which hath his beeing in himselfe and of himsefe that giues being to all creatures by creation and continues the same by his prouidence one that giues a beeing and accomplishment to all his mercifull promises when the lord appeared to moses he shewed not his face vnto him but passed by him with a voice the lord the lord strong mercifull and gratious long suffering and plenteous in goodnes and truth in which place the lord proclaimes his name by his attributes so in the prophecie of ieremie i am he that shewes mercie iudgement and iustice in the land the same daniel confesseth in his praier when he saith o lord god which article great and fearfull keeping couenant and mercie toward the that loue thee amp keepe thy commandements and lastly the author to the hebrewes he that comes to god must beleeue that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him iii rule god must not be conceiued absolutely that is out of the trinitie but as he subsisieth in the person of the father son and the holy ghost so he must be knowne and conceiued of vs the auncient rule of the church is that the vnitie must be worshipped in trinitie and the trinitie in vnitie by this doe the protestant churches differ from all other assemblies of worshippers the turke conceiues and worships a god creator of heauen and earth but an abstracted god which is neither father son nor holy ghost the iew worshippeth god but out of christ and therefore a feigned and idol god the papist in word acknowledgeth and so worshippeth god but indeede makes god an idol because he worships him not in a true but in a feigned christ that sits at the right hand of the father in heauen and is also in the hands of euery masse priest after the words of cosecration but the protestant knowes god as he will be knowen and consequently worships him as he wilbe worshipped in father son and holy ghost iv rule when we direct our praiers or any worship to any one person we must include the rest in the same worship yes further we must retaine in minde the distinction and order of all the three persons without severing or sundring them for so they are named and propounded in the scriptures the reason is because as they are not seuered but conioyned in nature so they neither are nor must be seuered but conioyned in worship for example the man that praies to god the father for the forgiuenes of his sins must aske it of him for the merit of the son and by the assurance of the holy ghost againe he that praies for remission of his sinnes to god the son must pray that he would procure the father to graunt his pardon and withall assure it by his spirit he also that praies for the same to god the holy ghost must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes from the father by and for the merit of the son of the second part of religion touching the worship of god and first of the inward worship for the full answer hereof we must remember that the worship of god is twofold inward or outward inward is the worship of the mind the heart the conscience will and affections for man by all these ioyntly and seuerally performeth worship and seruice to his creator the outward is that worshippe whereby the inward is testified outwardly in the speach and actions the former of these two is the spirituall worship of the inward man and the very ground and foundation of all true worship of god for god is a spirit and therfore must be worshipped in spirit that is in the the minde conscience will and affections indeede all the worshippe of god is spirituall euen that which we call outward yet not of it selfe but by vertue of the inward from which it proceedeth the heades of inward worship are two adoration of god and cleaving to god for as they are two different actions of the heart so they may fitly be termed two distinct parts of god worship this distinction is in some part propounded by moses where he exhorteth the israelites to feare iehovah their god to adore him to cleaue vnto him and to swear by his name adoration is that part of god worship whereby a man vpon a vile and base estimation of himselfe as beeing but dust and ashes submits amp subiects his soule to the glorie and maiestie of god this hath two principal groundes in the heart which if they be wanting there can be no true worship of god the first is abnegation or deniall of our selues when we esteem our selues to be meerely nothing the second is exaltation or advancemet of god maiesty aboue all the things in the world exaples of these we haue many in the scriptures as of abraham who called god his lord and himselfe dust and ashes of the angels whome in a vision the prophet sawe standing before god with one wing couering their feete which signified the abasing of themselues and with another couering their faces which betokened their adoration of the maiestie of god of daniel when he confesseth to thee o lord belongeth righteousnes it selfe but to vs shame and confusion of face lastly of the woman of canaan who calls christ lord and her selfe a dogge now in adoration there are foure vertues feare obedience patience thankefulnesse feare is a great part of the worship of god which i prooue by two places laid together isaiah matth wherein feare and worship are taken for one and the same thing for that which esay calls feare matthew calls worship now in this feare there be two things that serue to distinguish it from all other feares first it is absolute for by it god is reuerenced absolutely saint paul exhorteth to yeelde tribute feare and honour to the magistrate not for himselfe but for god whose minister he is and our sauiour saith feare ye not them which kill the bodie and are not able to kill the soule but rather feare him which is able to destroy both soule and bodie in hell as if he should say i allow and command you to feare man onely for god who hath set them ouer you but feare god for himselfe secondly it makes a man first of all to feare the offence of god and then the punishment and iudgement for it is not a feare of the offence alone but of the offence and punishment together and of the offence in the first place mal if i be a lord where is my feare and where it is saide in matthew but rather feare him that is able to cast bodie and soule into hell fire there is commanded a feare of god in regard of his anger we feare the sword of man and that lawfully why then may we not feare the punishment of god if it be said this is a seruile feare to feare the punishment and agrees not to god children i answer slauish feare is when a man only fears the punishment amp not the offence of god or at least the punishment more then the offence the second vertue of adoration is inward obedience of the hidden man of the heart the lord preferres this obedience before all sacrifice sam this standeth in two things first in yeelding subiection of the conscience to the commaundements threatnings and promises of god so as we are willing that it should become bound vnto them secondly when the rest of the powers of the soule in their place and time performe obedience vnto god and by this meanes doe we bring into captiuitie euery thought vnto the obedience of christ as paul speaketh corinthian the third vertue of adoration is patience which is when a man in his afflictions submitteth his will to the will of god and quieteth his heart therein because god sendeth afflictions this was dauids counsell be silent before the lord and alwaies waite vpon his pleasure and his practise when in trouble he resigned himselfe into the hands of god and said lord if i please thee not loe i am here doe with me as seemeth good in thine eyes this patience is a part of god worship because it is a kind of obedience the fourth vertue of adoration is thankfulnesse to god which shewes it selfe in two things first in an acknowledgement of the heart that our selues and whatsoeuer we haue is god and proceedeth from his blessing alone secondly in a consecration of our body soules liues callings and labours to the honour and seruice of god thus much of the first head of inward worship or the first action of the heart standing in adoration the second action of the heart in inward worship or the second part thereof is cleauing vnto god now we cleaue vnto god by foure things by faith hope loue and inward inuocation by faith i meane true iustifying faith whereby we rest vpon god mercie for the forgiuenes of our sinnes and life euerlasting and vpon his prouidence for the things of this life thus abraham beeing strengthened in this faith and relying by it vpon god promises made vnto him gaue glorie vnto god rom this sauing faith is the very roote and beginning of all true worship for loue which is the fulfilling of the law must come from it tim the second is hope which followes and dependes vpon faith and it is that grace of god whereby with patience we waite the lord leisure for the performance of his promises especially touching redemption and life eternall if we hope saith paul for that we haue not we doe with patience expect it rom the third is loue of god which hath two effects in the heart first it makes the heart to cleaue vnto god and to be well pleased with him simply for himselfe in this manner god the father louing christ testifieth that he was well pleased in him matth secondly it mooues the heart to seeke by all meanes possible to haue true fellowship with god in christ this the church notably expresseth in the canticles the fourth is inward praier or inuocation of the heart and it is nothing els but the lifting vp of the heart vnto god according to his will by desires and grones vnspeakable or it is a worke of the heart whereby it flies vnto god for help in distresse amp makes him a rocke of defence when the children of israel were afflicted they remembred that god was their strength and the most high god their redeemer psalm of this kinde of prayer paul speakes when he saith pray continually thess for solemne prayer conceiued and vttered in forme of words cannot alwaies be vsed but we are to lift vp our hearts vnto god vpon euery occasion that by inward and holy motions and affections they may be as it were knitte vnto him now to conclude this point touching inward worship we must remember that it alone is properly simply and of it selfe the worship of god and the outward is not simply the worship of god but onely so farre forth as it is quickned by the inward and grounded vpon it for god is a spirit and therefore the true worship that is done vnto him must be performed in spirit and truth ioh of the outward worship of god and the first head thereof prayer thus much of the inward worship of god the outward is that which is performed by the bodie externally eitherin word or deede to this belong many particulars which i will reduce to eight seuerall heads touching praier conceiued and vttered by the voice there are many questions of conscience the principall whereof are foure ans the word of god requires many conditions in making praier to god they may all be brought to three heads some of them goe before the making of praier some are to be performed in the act of praier some after praier is ended conditions to be obserued before praier are three first he that would make such a praier as god may be pleased to heare must repent isaiah god would not heare the praiers of the iewes because their hands were full of blood that is because they had not repented of their oppression and crueltie ioh god heares not sinners that is such as liue and lie in their sinnes and turne not vnto god by true repentance ioh by this we know that god heares our prayers if we keepe his commandements i adde further that the man which hath before time repented must againe renew his repentance if he desire that his praiers should be accepted for the very particular sinnes of man whereinto they fall after their repentance doe hinder the course of their praiers from hauing accesse vnto god if they be not repented of and for this cause the worthie man of god the prophets in the old testament doe vsually in the beginning of their praiers still humble themselues and confesse their sinnes as we may see in the example of daniel chap v ampc and of ezra chap v ampc secondly before a man make a praier he must first if neede require be reconciled vnto his brother if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee leaue there thine offer and goe thy way first be recociled to thy brother amp then come and offer thy gift matthew when ye shall stand and pray forgiue if ye haue any thing against any man ampc mark thirdly he that is to pray must prepare himselfe in heart and mind as one that is to speake familiarly with god in this preparation foure things are required first the mind is to be emptied of all carnall amp worldly thoughts secondly there must be in the minde a consideration of the things to be asked thirdly a lifting vp of the heart vnto the lord psalm fourthly the heart must be touched with a reuerence of the maiestie of god to whome we pray eccl be not rash with thy mouth nor let thy heart be hasty to vtter a thing before god for the neglect herof the lord threatneth to bring a iudgment vpon the israelites esay the second sort of conditions are those that are required in praier and they are in number eight i euery petition must proceed from a liuely sense and feeling of our owne wants and of our spirituall pouertie for without this no praier can be earnest and hartie and consequently become acceptable vnto god for example when we pray that god name may be hallowed we must in making that petition haue in our harts a sense of the corruption of our nature wherby we are prone to dishonour the name of god ii our praier must proceede from an earnest desire of that grace which we want and this desire is indeede praier it selfe moses vttering neuer a word but groning in the spirit vnto god in the behalfe of the isralites is said to crie vnto the lord exod we know not saith paul what to pray as we ought but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sights that cannot be expressed rom iii the petition must proceede from sauing and true iustifying faith the reason is because without that faith it is impossible that either our persons or our praiers or any other action we doe should please god heb iv euery petition must be grounded vpon the word of god and not framed according to the carnall conceit and fansie of mans braine and this is the assurance that we haue in him that if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs ioh now we haue a double ground of our praier in god word a commandement to make the praier either generall or particular and a promise that our requests shalbe granted here we must remember two rules first things to be asked are either spirituall or temporall spirituall are such as concerne god whereof some are more necessarie to saluation as remission of sinnes faith repentance and such like some are lesse necessarie as hope ioy in the feeling of god mercie in distresse ampc temporall things are such as belong to this life as meate drinke clothing preferment and such like now touching things spirituall that are moore necessary to saluation we are to pray for them absolutely without any exception or condition but for things lesse necessary to saluation and for temporall blessings we must aske them at god hand with this condition if it be his will and pleasure and so farre forth as he in his wisdome shall iudge to be most expedient for vs herein we must follow the example of christ who in his agonie prayed to his father to take that cuppe from him yet with this condition not my will but thy will be done the reason is this looke how far sorth god commands vs to aske and promiseth that we shall receiue so far forth are we warranted to aske and may hope to receiue now god commands vs to aske and promiseth vs the first sort of spirituall things freely and simply without any condition or exception but the other sort of spirituall things that are lesse necessary and temporall blessings he promiseth vs with condition and therefore in like sort ought we to aske them the second rule is we must not in our prayer bind god to any circumstances of time place or measure of that grace or benefit which we aske v our praiers being thus framed as hath beene said are to be presented and offered to god alone and to none but him for first none els can heare all man in all places at all times and helpe all man in all places and at all times but onely he againe the spirit of god makes vs to pray and in prayer to call him abba father furthermore all praier must be grounded vpon the word wherein we haue not the least warrant either expressely setdowne or by consequent implyed to preferre our sutes and requests to any of the creatures vi praier is to be presented to god in the name merit and mediation of christ alone for we our selues are not worthie of any thing but shame and confusion therefore we cannot pray in our owne names but must pray onely in the name of christ our praiers are our sacrifices and christ alone is that altar whereon we must offer them to god the father for this altar must sanctific them before they can be a sacrifice of a sweete smeiling sauour vnto god hence it is that not onely our petitions but all other things as paul wisheth are to be done in the name of the lord iesus coloss and christ himselfe saith whatsoeuer you aske the father in my name he will giue it you ioh vii there must be in praier instancie and perseuerance the heart must be instant not onely in the act of praier but afterwards till the thing asked be granted this instancie is commended vnto vs in the parable of the widdow and the vnrighteous iudge luke hereunto the prophet exhorteth when he saith keepe not silence and giue the lord no rest ampc isaiah and s paul in like manner wisheth the romanes to striue with him by praiers to god for him rom viii euery true praier must haue in it some thanksgiuing vnto god for his benefits in all things let your requests be shewed vnto god in praier and supplication with giuing of thanks philipp christ himself gaue directio touching this in that forme of prayer which he taught his disciples for thine is the kingdome power and glorie the third sort of conditions are those which are required after prayer and they are specially two the first is a particular faith whereby he that praieth must be assured that his particular request shall be granted mark whatsoeuer ye desire when ye pray beleeve that ye shall haue it and it shall be done vnto you and that he may haue this particular faith he must first haue that whence it ariseth namly true iustifying faith standing in a perswasion of his reconciliation with god the second is that a man must doe and practise that which he praies for and he is not onely to pray for blessings but also to vse all lawful meanes that he can whereby the blessings he asketh may be obtained for example as thou praiest for the pardon of thy sinns so thou must leaue thy sinns and vse all good meanes whereby the same may be mortified and crucified and the like is to be done in all other things which we aske of god thus we haue the first question of conscience resolued touching praier that then the praier is acceptable to god when he that prayeth obserueth as much as in him lyeth all these conditions before in and after praier for answer to this we must marke and obserue sundry distinctions and differences first we must distinguish betweene the cause and the person that defends and maintaines the cause the euill cause which an evil man defendeth is to be condemned of vs amp wee may alwaies and that lawfully pray against it but we may not in like sort condemne and pray against his person secondly we must distinguish of the persons of our enemy some be priuate enemy some publicke priuate i call those which be enemy of some particular man and are against them in regard of this or that cause or matter and yet are not enemy of god or of his truth publike are those which are not only our enemy but the enemy of god of his kingdome of his trueth and relion now we may not pray against priuate enemy we may as before pray against their euill cause but not against their persons math blesse them that curse you doe good to them that hate you and pray for them which hurt you and persecute you and we are commanded to loue our enemy as our selues againe publicke enemy of god and his truth are also of two sorts either curable or incurable curable are such as offend of ignorance or some other humane frailty so as there is some hope of their conuersion and repentance we must not pray against the persons of these but onely against their dealings and badde causes and pray for their persons and for their conuersio thus christ praied for those that crucified him father forgiue them and stephe act for them that stoned him vncureable are those that sinne obstinately and of malice so as there is no hope of their amendment and conuersion and further for the better answering of this question we must marke another distinction there are two sorts of man that are to make praier vnto god some that haue extraordinary gifts as the prophets and apostles now he that is an extraordinarie man hath and must haue these two gifts namely first a spirit of discerning to discerne and iudge whether the person against whome he praies be incureable or no and secondly a pure zeale of god honour and glory the extraordinary man that is qualified with these two gifts may pray not onely against the cause of him that is an enemie to god but against his person thus dauid did especially in the psalm which psalme is full of terrible curses against his particular enemy and typically against iudas for he had the spirit of discerning by which he knewe that they were incurable enemy and a pure zeale of the glorie of god which made him breake out into such imprecations so paul praies gal that they might be cut off which troubled the church ampc tim he praies directly against the person of alexander the coppersmith that had don him much wrong the lord reward him according to his workes which must not seeme strange for paul had in that imprecation the spirit of prophecie and consequently both the spirit of discerning and of pure zeale and therefore he might pray against him as he did but for ordinarie man such as haue nothing but ordinarie gifts and want the spirit of discerning and haue also a zeale mingled with choler stomack anger and hatred they may vse no extraordinarie praier against the person of any man all that they may doe is to pray that god would restraine their malice hinder their badde practises and turne them to his glorie and the good of his church therefore act when there had beene a councell holden at ierusalem against the apostles peter and john in the first beginning of the great persecution of christians in the primitiue church it is said that they departed from the assembly and praied together with the rest of the church in this manner and now o lord behold their threatnings ampc wherein they praied not against the councell nor against the man that sate in counsell but against their proceedings courses deuises and threatnings and their practise may be a patterne for ordinary man to follow in luke the disciples asking our sauiour christ whether they should call for fire from heauen to destroy his enemy he sharply reprooueth them for their intemperate heate against the samaritans and tells them that they had not that extraordinarie spirit to effect such a thing because they were but ordinarie man ordinarie man therefore may not pray against the persons of god enemy the pope at this day is a professed enemie to christ and his gospel yet no man may pray against the person of the pope but onely against his state kingdome and regiment which is antichristian whereby he sets himselfe against god and his kingdome vpon the answer to this question there followeth an other sundrie psalmes of dauid are psalmes of imprecation wherin dauid curseth his enemy fearefully especially in the psalme now all these psalmes were penned for our vse it may therefore be demanded how we may vse these and such like when we read or sing them ans i we must not vse them as dauid did namely as praiers against the persons of our enemy but onely as prophecies against the enemy of god wherein the punishment of incurable man that were enemy to god and his truth is foretold for wee haue not as dauid had an extraordinarie spirit or a pure zeale therefore we cannot pray as he did ii i answer whereas these imprecations were directed against particular enemy we may vse them in some sort as praiers but how as generall praiers against all the incureable enemy of god not against any particulars among the iewes turkes or papists as therfore as we may vse these imprecations as praiers so we must vse them without any particular application to the persons of any particular man ans there are chiefly foure i the voice or speech ii the gesture iii the place where iv the time when concerning the voice this question may be mooued whether a voice or words are o be vsed in prayer or no ans prayer is either pub cke or priuate in publike prayer a forme of wordes must alwaies be vsed in a knowne plaine and distinct voice the reasons are these first the minister is the mouth of the whole congregation in prayer as he is the mouth of god to the people in preaching now as the minister is their mouth to god in prayer so the people must giue their assent and approbation to his prayer by the word amen but there can be no professed and publique assent without a voice secondly god is the creator not onely of the soule of man but also of his bodie and we blesse god not onely with the heart but also with the tongue therefore the whole man must pray in publicke now in priuate prayer made in priuate and secret places by priuate persons the voice is profitable but not simply necessarie it is profitable because it stirreth vp the affections of the heart it serueth also to keepe the wandering minde in compasse to expresse the affection and to procure attention of the heart to the prayer yet it is not simply necessarie for a man is not bound in co cience to vse a forme of wordes in all his prayers moses prayed he spake neuer a word and yet it was a prayer for the lord saies vnto him exod why criest thou anna praying in the temple her lippes did mooue onely her voice was not heard and yet shee is said to pray sam againe the spirit is said to pray in the elect with groanes that cannot be vttered and yet the holy ghost giues them the name of prayers rom paul biddes vs pray continually which is not to be vnderstood of a continuall vse of a forme of words but of the groanes and sighes of the heart which may be made at all times out of this question ariseth another whether it be lawful when we pray to read a set forme of prayer for some thinke that to doe so is a sinne ans it is no sinne but a man may lawfully and with good conscience doe it reasons first the psalmes of dauid were deliuered to the church to be vsed and read in a set forme of words and yet the most of them are praiers secondly to conceiue a forme of praier requires gifts of memorie knowledge vtterance and the gifts of grace now euery child and servant of god though he haue an honest heart yet hath he not all these gifts and therefore in the want of them may lawfully vse a set forme of prayer as a man that hath a weake backe or a lame legge may leane vpon a crutch it is alleadged that set formes of praier doe limit and binde the holy ghost ans if we had a perfect measure of grace it were somewhat but the graces of god are weake and small in vs this is no binding of the holy ghost but a helping of the spirit which is weake in vs by a crutch to leane vpon therefore a man may with good conscience vpon defect of memory and vtterance ampc vse a set forme of prayer the second circumstance is the gesture concerning which it is demanded what kind of gesture is to be vsed in praier whether kneeling standing sitting or the holding vp the hands or head to heauen or bowing the body to the earth answer god in his word hath not prescribed any particular gesture of the body and therfore our consciences are not bound to any in particular besides that religion stands not properly in bodily actions and gestures yet touching gesture the word of god giues certaine generall rules to be obserued in prayers both publicke and priuate in publicke praier these rules of gesture are prescribed first when publicke praier is made in the congregation our gesture must alwaies be comely modest amp decent secodly all gesture vsed publickely must serue to expresse as much as may be the inward humility of the hart without hypocrisie now these kinds are manifold some concern the whole body as the bowing thereof the casting of it downe vpon the ground some againe concerne the parts of the body as lifting vp of the head the eies the hands bowing the knees ampc touching these the scripture hath not bound vs to any particulars but in them all we must haue regard that they serue alway to expresse the humilitie of our hearts before god thus haue the holy man of god behaued themselues yes the holy angels standing before the arke doe couer their faces in token of reuerece of the maiestie of god esay thirdly we must in publicke praier content our selues to followe the laudable fashion and custome of that particular church where we are for to decline from customes of particular churches in such cases often causeth scisme and dissensions in priuate praier done in priuate and secret places there is more liberty for in it we may vse any gesture so it be comely and decent and serue to expresse the inward humility of our hearts an auncient writer is of opinion that it is an vnreuerent and unlawful thing to pray sitting but both the learned before in and after his time haue iudged his opinion superstitious specially considering that religion stands not in the outward gesture of the body and it skills not much what that is so the inward humility of a syncere heart be expressed therby the third circumstance is the place where question is made in what place we must pray answer in regard of conscience holines and religion all places are equal and alike in the new testament since the comming of christ the house or the field is as holy as the church and if we pray in either of them our prayer is as acceptable to god as that which is made in the church for now the daies are come that were foretold by the prophet wherein a cleane offer should be offered to god in euery place mal which paul expo ds tim of pure and holy praier offened to god in euery place to this purpose christ said to the woman of samaria ioh that the time should come when they not worship in ierusalem or in samaria but the true worshippers of god should worship him in spirit and in truth wheresoeuer it be yet neuerthelesse for order decency and quietnes sake publicke prayer must be made in publicke places as churches and chappels appointed for that vse and priuate praier in priuate houses and clozets mat now the opinion of the papist is otherwise for he thinkes that in the new testamet hallowed churches are more holy then other places are or can be and doe make the prayers offered to god in them more acceptable to him then in any other and herevpon they teach that priuate man must pray in churches and priuate prayers must be made in churches if they will haue them heard for proofe hereof they alleadge the practise of some particular persons in the scriptures of anna who praied priuately in the temple luke of dauid who in his exile desired greatly to haue recourse vnto the temple and of daniel who is saide to looke out at the window toward the temple and pray daniel answer these places are abused by the popish church for there is great difference betweene the temple at ierusalem in the old testament and our churches in the new that was built by particular commandemet from god so were not our churches that was a type of the very body and manhood of christ heb and of his misticall bodie column againe the arke in the temple was a pledge and signification of the couenant a signe of god presence a pledge of his mercie and that by his owne appointment for it was his will there to answere his people but the like cannot be shewed of our churches or chappells it will be saide that the sacrament is a signe of god presence for in it god is present after a sort ans it is true christ is present in the sacrament but when not alwaies but then onely when the sacrament is administred and the administration beeing once ended christ is no more present in the elements of bread and wine and in the very act of celebration he is not carnally but spiritually present the fourth circumstance is the time quest what are the times in which man are to make prayers vnto god for answer to this question it is first to be considered that there is a twofold manner of praying and consequently two kindes of prayer the first is the secret and sudden lifting vp of the heart to god vpon the present occasion the second is set or solemne prayer the first sort of praiers haue of auncient time beene called eiaculations or the darts of the heart and the time of this kind of prayer is not determined but is and may be vsed at any time without exception this point i make plaine by these reasons the first is the commandement of god thess pray without ceasing ephesians pray alwaies with all manner of prayer and supplication in the spirit and watch thereunto with all perseuerance for all saints in both these places by praier and supplications paul vnderstandeth the sudden lifting vp of the heart vnto god secondly whatsoeuer we speake thinke or doe we must doe all to the glorie of god now god is glorified when we doe in all things from our hearts acknowledge his power wisdome iustice mercie prouidence and goodnes and these we doe acknowledge when we daily and howerly lift vp our hearts to him in petition for some blessings and in thanksgiuing for his mercies thirdly we are subiect to innumerable infirmities frailties and wants so as we cannot of our selues so much as thinke one good thought therefore we are euery day and hower to lift vp our hearts to god partly in praier partly in giuing of thankes that he would make a daily supplie by his grace fourthly satan seekes by all meanes to ouerthrow our soules continually and in that regard it behooueth vs alwaies and vpon euery occasion to lift vp our hearts to god for his mercifull protection fiftly the gift of faith must grow and increase in vs day by day and the meanes whereby it groweth and thriueth in vs are the exercises of faith not seldome and rare but daily and continually vsed now of all the exercises of faith none is more exceilent then invocation and thanksgiuing the second kinde of prayer is set and solemne when a man sets himselfe apart to pray vnto god vsually and feruently or when man come reuerently and solemnely together into the congregation to call vpon the name of the lord the word of god appoints no set time for this kind but leaues it to the libertie wisdome and discretion of man and the ground of this libertie is this there is now no difference betweene time and time in regard of conscience for performing the worship of god and the duties of religion the saboth onely excepted but the principall and onely difference is in regard of outward order and conueniencie whereby one time may be thought fitter then an other and that must be discerned by the wisdome of man in the new testament the distinction of daies and houres is taken away paul was afraid of the galatians because they made difference of daies times moneths and yeares in respect of holines and religion gal by this doctrine we may see what to iudge of the romane religion touching set times of prayer they prescribe certaine houres which they tearme canonicall and they distinguish them in this manner the first they call the matutine before the sun rising the second the prime from the first houre of the day to the third the third from thence to the sixt hower the fourth from the sixt to the ninth the fift from the ninth to the twelfth which they call the none the fixt is in the euening about the sun setting the seuenth and last is after the sun setting which they call the completorie now in these seauen prescribed howers by the doctrine deliuered i note three notable abuses first in that the popish church binds man in conscience to obserue them vpon paine of mortall sinne whereas in regarde of conscience there is no difference of times secondly they bind the masse priest the deacon subdeacon and the beneficed man onely to canonicall houres whereas those houres differ not from others in regard of performance of god worship neither are these man more bound to pray in them then others thirdly that a man may say and read his canonicall houres this day for the morrow and in the morning or after dinner for the whole day wherein we may see their grosse superstition these accidents are principally three first when they should pray they cannot frame or conceiue a forme of praier as other man doe for remoouing of which trouble let them remember this one thing that the vnfeigned desire of the touched heart is a praier in acceptance before god though knowledge memorie and vtterance to frame and conceiue a forme of prayer in words be wating ps god heares the desire of the poore that is of humbled persons and them which are in distresse psalm god will fulfill the desire of them that feare hi he also will heare their cry and will saue them rom we know not how to pray as we ought but the spirit of god that is the spirit of adoption maketh requests for vs by grones amp sighes which cannot be vttered where we may obserue that the prayer of the holy ghost which must needes be an excellent prayer is made by grones which cannot be vttered in words the second accident is that they finde them selues full of heauines and deadnes of spirit and their minds full of by thoughts and wandting imaginations this trouble may be remooued vpon this ground that the defects of our prayer shall neuer condemne vs if we be heartily displeased with our selues for the same and by prayer and other good meanes doe struggle and striue against them rom there is no codemnation to them that be in christ in which place it is not saide they doe nothing worthy of codem ation but thus there is no condemnation to them being in christ though they deserue it neuer so much the third accidet is that though they pray they receiue not the fruit of their praiers for the remooueall of this distresse we may consider these foure things i the man that is thus troubled is to examine himselfe whether he hath made his praier to god aright or no for if he pray amisse he may pray long and neuer be heard our sauiour would not grant the request of the sonns of zebedeus because they asked they knew not what matthew iam ye aske amp receiue not because ye aske amisse that ye might consume it on your lusts paul prayed three times and had the repulse because he asked things inconuenient for him to receiue therefore answere was made my grace is sufficient for thee corinthian the man therefore that would make a praier aright must haue respect vnto the matter and forme thereof as also to the disposition of his owne heart if he faile in any of these then god will not heare or if he doth he heares in iustice ii though man make lawful praiers vnto god amp aske things that are to be asked and which god will grant yet god will sometime deserre the accomplishment of their praiers and not giue eare vnto them at the first dauid prayed night and day and yet was not heard psalm againe his eies failed his throat was drie while he waited for his god by prayer psalm the angel gabriel said to zachary luke thy prayer is heard now in all likelihood that prayer of zachary was made long before euen in his youth yet it was not granted him till he was olde the lord deferres the graunt of our requests vpon good reason for hereby he stirreth vp the dulnes of our hearts and quickeneth our faith and hope againe he makes vs when we enioy the blessings desired to haue them in higher estimation and to be more thankefull vnto him yes in the want thereof to striue the more earnestly with him by praier for them the woman of canaan was repulsed and called a dogge by our sauiour christ not for that he intended to reiect her prayer but to stirre vp her faith to make her more earnest in asking as also more thankefull for the benefit when shee had receiued it iii the lord vseth to graunt our petitions two manner of waies first by giuing the very thing we aske secondly by giuing something answerable therto when he grateth not the thing it selfe thus christ was heard in that which he feared heb he prayed to be deliuered from that cuppe which notwithstading he drank of how the was he heard though he had not that which he asked yet god granted him the thing which was proportionable to his request namely strength and power whereby he was inabled to ouercome the woefull pangs of that death iv we must thinke this sufficient that we can and doe pray vnto god though we neuer haue any request in this world graunted for by whose grace haue we alwaies continued in praier but by the gift and grace of god paul in the like case was answered by god my grace is sufficient for thee that is thine infirmitie shall not be remooued content thy selfe in this that thou article in my fauour and hast receiued my grace by which thou doest withstand this temptation to this purpose s john saith if we know that he heareth vs whatsoeuer we aske we know that we haue the petitions graunted which we desired of him ioh his meaning is if we can perceiue and discerne that god listneth to our praiers hereby we may assure our selues that he graunts our requests now by this we may perceiue that he doth listen and giue eare to vs because the grace whereby we pray is from him alone of the second head of god worship the hearing of the word preached thus much touching the first head of outward worship namely prayer nowe followes the next which is the hearing of the word preached the questions concerning this point are of two sorts some concerne the preachers of the word and some the hearers the first sort i omit and reserue them to a more proper place for the second sort concerning hearers one question may be mooued the necessitie of this question appeares by that speciall caueat giuen by our sauiour christ luke take heede how ye heare ans to the profitable hearing of god word three things are required preparation before we heare a right disposition in hearing and duties to be practised afterward i in preparation sundrie rules of direction are to be obserued first rule we must be swift to heare iam and this we shall doe by disburdening our selues of all impediments which may hinder the effectuall hearing of the word these impediments are especially three all which are named by the apostle iames together with their seuerall remedies the first is presumption when the hearer presumes of his wisdome knowledge and abilitie to teach if neede were his teachers the remedie hereof is to be slowe to speake that is not to presume of our owne gifts thinking our selues better able to teach others then to be taught by them for so the apostle afterwardes expoundes himselfe when he saith my brother be not many masters iam let not priuate persons take vpon them to become instructers of other man but as paul saith corinthian if any man among you seeme to be wise let him be a foole that he may be wise that is let him be willing to learne euen of his inferiours and in this regard let him follow the practise of naaman who submitted himselfe to the aduise and counsell of his maide the second impediment is troubled affections specially rash anger either against the teacher or others the remedie of this also is laid downe in the place before alleadged be slow to wrath v the third is superfluitie of malitiousnes that is the abundance of euill corruptions and sinnes which hearers shall by experience find in their owne hearts and liues this impediment hath many branches principally three hardnes of heart noted by the stonie ground in the parable of the lower matth the cares of the world signified by the thornie ground v the itching eare tim when a man will heare no other doctrine but that which is sutable to his corrupt nature not beeing willing to frame his heart to the word but to haue the word framed to his wicked heart the remedies of this impediment are these first euery hearer of the word must lay apart all supersluitie of malitiousnes that is cut off as much as in him lieth all corruptions both of heart and life hence it is that god speaketh thus to the wicked man psalm what hast thou to doe to take my word in thy mouth seeing thou hatest to be reformed and hast cast my words behinde thee to this purpose the prophet ieremie exhorteth the iewes to be circumcised to the lord and to take away the foreskinnes of their hearts ampc ier and moses by god commandement was to sanctifie the people three daies before they came to heare the law deliuered by himselfe in mount sinai exod again euery man will and ought to haue a care to prepare himselfe more or lesse to the receiuing of the lord supper which dutie is as well to be performed before the hearing of the word considering that in substance it differeth not from the sacraments they beeing the visible and preaching the audible voice of god secondly euery hearer must receiue the word with meekenes that is with quietnes subiect himselfe to the word of god in all things isaiah i dwell with him that is of an humble spirit to reuiue the spirit of the humble ampc the second rule of preparation wee must lift vp our hearts in praier to god that he would giue vs the hearing eare this hearing eare is a gift of god inabling the heart when it heareth to conceiue and vnderstand the doctrine taught and to yeeld obedience thereunto the third rule the hearer must in hearing set himselfe in the presence of god now therefore saith cornelius to peter act are we all here present before god to heare all things commanded thee of god the reason is because god is alwaies in the congregation where the word is preached ii the second thing required to profitable hearing is a right disposition wherein two rules are to be obserued first when the word of god is in deliuering euery hearer must heare with iudgment but some will say many preachers bewray faults and infirmities in their preaching to this paul answereth notwithstanding despise not prophecie thess yes but what if they deliuer vntruthes paul answeres againe in the next verse try all things and keep that which is good and saint john to the like purpose ioh beleeue not euery spirit but try the spirits whether they be of god her by the way we must remember one cau at there be three kinds of iudgement the one is a priuate wherby euery priuate person may iudge of the doctrine which is taught for he must not heare hand ouerhead but iudge of that which he heareth of this saint paul speaks to the corinths iudge ye what i say corinthian the second is the iudgement of the prophet or minister and this is a surer kind of iudgement then the former proceeding from a greater measure of god grace the third is the iudgement of the holy ghost in scripture and this is soueraigne and absolute for the holy ghost iudgeth all and is iudged of none these three kinds of iudgment are set in this order the first depends vpon the second the second vpon the third and the third is absolute and iudged of none vpon this caueat two things doe follow first that a priuate hearer though he may iudge of doctrine deliuered yet he may not censure the teacher or his ministrie ministers are to be iudged but their spirit is not subiect to euery priuate man but to the prophets for the spirit of the prophet that is the doctrine which the prophets bring beeing inspired by the holy ghost is subiect to the prophets corinthian secondly a priuate man is not to publish or broach any point of doctrine but that which is plainly propounded in the word and taught by the ministers thereof this is a necessarie rule and the want of obseruation thereof is the cause of many scismes and haeresies in the church the lord commands the people mal to require the law at the mouth of the priest in all maine points of faith and manners the second rule to be obserued in hearing euery hearer must haue care that the word of god be rooted and grounded in his heart like good feede in good ground which saint iames expresseth iam receiue with meekenes the ingrafted word here generally it is to be remembred that not onely ignorant people but euen the most learned ought to be hearers of the word preached for the preaching thereof serues not onely for the increasing of knowledge but also for the reformation of the affection which may be inordinate where knowledge doth abound now for the rooting of the word of god in our hearts sundry things are required first a true amp right vnderstanding therof secondly it must be mingled with faith heb for the word is as wine or water of life our faith is the sugar that sweetneth it and giues it a pleasant relish the word therfore must be tempered and mixed with our saith that it may become profitable vnto vs now in this mixture there is required a double faith the first generall whereby we beleeue the doctrine deliuered to be true so as we neuer call the same into question our gospell to you saith paul was in much assurance thess the second special whereby we apply the word preached vnto our selues for the humbling and comforting of our hearts thirdly we must labour to be affected with the word thus iosiah his heart is said to melt at the reading of the law chro and the people reioyced greatly because they vnderstood the word which the leuites had taught them neh the hearts of the two disciples that went to emmaus burned within them when christ opened vnto them the scriptures luke and the iewes at peters sermon were pricked in their hearts and said man and brother what shall we doe act fourthly the word of god must dwell plenteously in vs coll this is doth when it rules and beares the greatest sway in the heart and is not ouerruled by any corrupt affection iii the duties to be performed after hearing are these first the doctrine deliuered must be treasured vp in the heart and practised in life psalm i haue hid thy word in my heart that i might not sinne against thee secondly a man must meditate on the word which he hath heard with lifting vp of his heart vnto god the beast that were clouen footed and chewed the cudde were fittest both for meate vnto man and for sacrifice to god levit it was the olde and auncient opinion of the church that this chewing the cudde signified holy meditations and he that heares the word must doe as the beast doth fetch vp the meate out of his bellie againe and chewe it ouer a new the man that doth so is the fittest for the lord vse thirdly he must haue experience of the word of god in himselfe psalm tast and see how gracious the lord is fourthly he is to examine himselfe after he hath heard the word thus dauid saith of himselfe psalm i haue considered my wayes and turned my feete vnto thy testimonies fiftly he must be obedient vnto it and testifie his obediece though not at all times yet whensoeuer occasion is offered iam be ye doers of the word and not hearers onely deceiuing your owne selues for resolution of this question the causes of not profiting are distinctly to be considered and they are of two sorts the first sort of causes are the sinnes of the hearers and that sinnes are the causes of not profiting it will appeare by this signe if the memorie vnderstanding and other parts of the minde in common matters be strong and pregnant but dull and weake in apprehending and retaining the doctrine taught now these sinnes are principally two first hardnes of heart when a man is not inwardly mooued and affected with the word preached but remaines in the same state he was before this is set forth by the hard ground that is by the high way side and by the stonie ground math and such is the heart that is not mooued nor affected either with ioy sorrow feare or consolation the hardnes of heart ariseth from a custome in sinning and from that the deceitfulnesse of sinne heb secondly worldly cares that is a heart possessed with desire of profit pleasures honours preferments and such like which be as thornes that choake the seede of the word and suffer it not to grow and fructifie yes that fill the heart full of wandering imaginations which steale away the mind from attending to the word preached those that are thus hindred from profiting are rather to be reprooued then comforted for that the cause of their non proficiencie is in amp from themselues they are therefore to vse all good meanes for the remooueall of their sinnes that of hard hearted and carnall they may become good and profitable hearers of the word the meanes are these first they must labour to be touched in heart with sense and feeling of their spirituall pouertie and want of god fauour and mercie in the pardon of their sinnes the reason is giuen of dauid psalm the lord teacheth the humble his waies and by marie in her song luke he hath filled the hungrie with good things and the rich he hath sent emptie away the second meanes is to heare the word of god with an honest heart ioyned with a constant purpose of not sinning the third to be as carefull to bring good affections as a good vnderstanding for affections are the feete that carrie the heart and salomon biddes vs to take heede to our feete when we enter into the house of god eccl they are the very key of knowledge and memory and therefore dauid saies the secret of the lord is reuealed to those that feare him and his couenant is to giue them vnderstanding psalm and that which he saith of feare may be said also of other good affections the second sort of causes are ordinary and vsuall defects of naturall gifts as of capacity or conceipt of memory and vnderstanding for all man haue not the like gifts of nature and therfore all man cannot reape benefit by the word preached these wants may be discerned thus if the mind and memory be weake or wanting as well in common wordly matters as in diuine things that belong to god kingdome and to this kinde of man which are thus troubled for not profiting there belongeth comfort yet not simply but vpon these conditions first if they know the principall grounds of religion secondly if they haue care to profit and increase in knowledge thirdly if they liue according to the measure of their knowledge in obedience to god will these beeing obserued such parties are to comfort themselues in this that god in mercy will accept of their indeauour forgiue their ignorance and beare with their infirmities this is to be seene in the example of peter whose faith was highly commended by christ when he said the gates of hell should not preuaile against it matthew and yet at that very time peter was ignorant of many maine pointes of religion as of the death resurrection and ascension of christ and in his person the other discisples are commended also for their faith because they held christ to be the messias and sauiour of the world though they were ignorant of the manner of his redemption thinking he should haue beene an earthly king act againe the want of knowledge in such as haue naturall defects may be supplied by good affection if they be not wanting in an honest heart and carefull indeauour of godly life thus the church of the iewes in the old testament did farre exceede the church of the new in good affection though it came farre short of it in knowledge and apprehension of the sacraments in generall the reeeiuing and vse of them in the next place follow the questions of conscience touching the third part of god outward worship namely the sacraments and these concerne either the administration or the receiuing of them the administration i will here let passe and handle those questions onely that concerne the receiuing and vse thereof both in generall and in particular touching the receiuing of the sacraments in generall there is one onely question for answere hereunto we are to knowe there be three sorts of man that may administer the sacraments some are true amp lawful ministers lawfully called by god amp man to that function keeping the right forme of the sacrament according to the institution some againe are more priuate persons that haue no authoritie at all to administer whome we may oppose to the former sort as contrary to them in this action others againe be admitted to stand in the roome of lawful ministers by the acceptation amp consent of man or by custome though corrupt and these are in a meane betweene the two former sorts of the first there is no question but the sacramet administred by the second is in truth a meere nullitie because they haue no calling thereto neither can they doe it of faith forasmuch as they haue neither precept nor exaple out of the word of god now for the third sort though they be not indeede lawful pastors yet beeing in the place of such by the consent allowance and custome of man though corrupt their action is of force and the sacrament which is administred by them is in deede a true sacrament which i prooue by these reasons first the preaching of the word and administration of the sacraments are all one in substance for in the one the will of god is seene in the other heard now the word preached by heretikes is the true word of god and may haue his effect the scribes and pharises great doctors of the iewes were not all of the tribe of levi but descended fro other tribes againe euen the principall of them liued by extortion and bribery and were wicked man yes heretikes and apostataes deposed amp excommunicated persons and yet because they occupied the places of good teachers and sate in the chaire of moses that is read the doctrine of moses law christ bids his disciples to heare them matthew prouided only that they tooke heed of the leauen of their false doctrine and wicked life now if the word taught by their ministery was powerfull why may not the sacraments ministred by the heretiques standing in the roome of true ministers be true sacraments in the daies of paul phillip some preached christ through enuy and strife and some of good wil what was the apostles iudgement in this case himselfe answereth v what then yet christ is preached all manner of wayes whether it be vnder a pretence or sinceerely and i therein ioy yes and will ioy secondly this point is plaine by examples the leviticall priests vnder the lawe were heretickes and taught after a sort the breach of the morall law yes they held iustification by workes rom and yet circumcision by them administred was in force neither was the passeouer celebrated by them or the sacrifices which they offered any other then the true passeouer and true sacrifices iudas was a very hypocrite yes christ calls him a deuill ioh and yet he preached the word at christs commandement and baptized with the rest of his disciples ioh thirdly the sacrament if it be administred in the name and by the power of christ is the ordinance of god beeing receiued by faith yes a true sacrament of christ and the force and efficacie thereof doth not depend vpon the worthines of the minister but vpon christ the letters or epistle sent from one man to an other are authenticall and serue fully to expresse the minde of the author though the messenger or carier be a wicked or a naughtie man and in like manner the sinne of any man that stands in the roome of a lawful minister doth not nullifie the sacrament and therefore not heresie or vnsufficiencie s cyprian who liued yeares after christ was of this opinion that sacraments administred by heretikes were no sacraments but the churches of africa in those times concluded the contrarie against him according to the doctrine that hath beene deliuered the vse i by this doctrine they are iustly to be blamed who would haue their children rebaptized which were before baptized by popish priests because the sacrament though administred by a papist if he stand in the roome of a true pastour amp keep the forme thereof is a true sacrament ii others by this doctrine come to be reprooued that refuse to receiue the sacraments at the hands of vnpreaching ministers for though the minister be vnsufficiet amp preach not yet if he be called by the church he hath the place of a lawful pastour his administration is warrantable and the sacrament by him administred a true sacrament if it be said that then the true sacraments may be out of the true church as in the church of rome at this day because hereticks and such like ministers are not of the church i answer that there is in the church of rome the hidden church of god and the sacraments are there vsed not for the roman church but for the hidden church which is in the midst of papacie like as the lanterne beareth light not for it selfe but for the passengers yet hence it followeth not that we should communicate with idolaters hereticks and wicked persons and so much of the administration of the sacraments in generall i come now to the particular sacraments of baptisme the first sacrament in order is baptisme and the questions touching it i reduce to fiue heads for answer to this question we must rightly distinguish of necessitie a thing is said to be necessarie two manner of waies either absolutely and simply or in part absolutely necessarie is that which is in all respects necessarie and the contrarie whereof is vtterly vnnecessarie necessarie in part is that which in some respects or vpon certaine causes and considerations is necessarie this distinction premised i answer first that baptisme is necessarie the second way in part and respectiuely that is in diverse and sundrie regards i as the lawful vse thereof is a note whereby the true church of god is discerned and distinguished from the false church not that the church of god cannot be a church without this sacrament for it may want baptisme for a time and yet remaine a true church as well as the church of the iewes in auncient times wanted circumcision for the space of fourtie yeares iosh and yet ceased not to be a true church and loued of god ii as it serueth for necessarie vses and purposes to man of yeares that are to be baptized as first to testifie vnto the church and themselues that they are receiued into the bodie of christ which is the company and societie of the faithfull secondly to testifie their obedience to god commandement amp their subiection to his ordinance appointed by him for their good thirdly to be a necessarie proppe to vphold their weaknesse a seale to confirme their faith in the couenant of grace and an instrument to conuey christ vnto them with all his benefits iii it is necessarie to infants as it serueth to enter and admit them into the visible church and withall to signifie their interest in the couenant of grace and consequently their right and title to life euerlasting secondly i answere that baptisme is not absolutely or simply necessary so as the partie that dies without it remaines in the state of damnation and cannot be saued my reasons are these i baptisme is appointed by god to be no more but a seale annexed vnto and depending vpon the couenant therefore we must put a difference betweene it and the couenant the couenant of grace and our beeing in christ is absolutely necessarie for no man woman or childe can be saued vnlesse they haue god for their god but the signe thereof is not for looke as to the essence of a bargaine the consent and agreement of the parties alone is of meere necessitie required and this beeing yelded the bargaine is a bargen though it be neither sealed subscribed nor confirmed by witnesses so likewise a man may be saued if he be within the couenant of grace though he haue not receiued the seale and signe thereof the sacrament of baptisme ii the bare want or priuation of baptisme when it cannot be had is pardonable amp doth not condemne the partie vn baptized the thiefe vpon the crosse was saued though he was neuer baptized luke and sundrie martyrs in former times who were god deare children and died for the maintenance of his truth though they wanted the outward and visible baptisme yet by god mercy they were not destitute of the inward and consequently were not condemned but saued and so many children vnder the law died before the eight day vncircumcised yes when any among them were weake and could not indure to haue the foreskinne of their flesh cutte in probability their circumcision was deferred and some of them died in the meane time which neuerthelesse being borne of beleeuing parents were vndoubtedly saved according to the promise of god made to abraham i will be thy god and the god of thy seede for as christ saith of the sabaoth so may we say of circumcision it was made for man and not man for it and it were a iudgement both rash and vncharitable to thinke that all the males of the children of israel that died before circumcision were condemned yet on the other side the wilfull contempt and carelesse neglect of this ordinance when it may conueniently be administred and receiued is deadly and damnable and to them that are guilty of this sinne is the threat of god iustly denounced gen euen that person shall be cut off from his people iii the grace and mercy of god is free and not tied or bound to the outward elements ioh the wind bloweth where it listeth that is god giues grace and vouchsafeth fauour to whome where and when it pleaseth him and hence it is that they whome he would not haue perish but come to eternall life shall be saued though they be not partakers of this sacrament iv infants borne of beleeuing parents are holy before baptisme and baptisme is but a seale of that holinesse corinthian the children of beleeuing parents are holy rom if the first fruits be holy so is the whole tumpe and if the root be holy so are the branches yes to them belongs the kingdome of heauen as well as to others christ saith suffer litle children ampc for to them belongeth the kingdome of heauen mark it is alleaged that those which are sanctified haue faith which infants haue not ans god saith i will be thy god and the god of thy head by vertue of this promise the parent layes hold on the couenant for himselfe and for his child and the childe beleeues because the father beleeues it is obiected again that infants are born in originall sinne and therefore cannot be borne holy and sanctified answer euery beleeuing parent sustaines a double person first as he is a man descending of adam by corrupted seede and thus beeing himselfe corrupted and vncleane his children also are corrupt and impure secondly as he is a holy and beleeuing man ingraffed by faith into christ the second adam and thus by his faith comes his child to be in the couenant and partaker of the benefits and priuiledges thereof and by the same faith he beeing a beleeuer the guilt of originall corruption which is in the infant new borne is not imputed vnto him to condemnation and for these causes the sacrament of baptisme is not absolutely and precisely necessarie to saluation but so and in that sort as hath bin declared against this doctrine it is obiected that christ saith to nicodemus except a man be borne of water and the holy ghost he can not enter into the kingdome of god ioh to this obiection sundrie answers are giuen first if the place be vnderstood of baptisme then the wordes may carrie one of these two senses first that our sauiour directs this speech principally against nicodemus who was a timerous professour and remained ignorant and had long neglected his baptisme secondly that the kingdome of heauen is here put not for euerlasting happines but to signifie the visible estate of the church of the new testament and then the meaning is no man can be admitted into the church and made a visible member thereof but by the water of baptisme neither can any man be made a liuely member of christ iesus but by the spirit that is by regeneration which alone makes the partie that is entred into the church by baptisme to be a liuing meber of the bodie of christ secondly others answer that this place is to be vnderstood not of baptisme but simply of regeneration and that christ alludes to the sayings of the prophets which speake of cleane water and expounds the same in this sort thou nicodemus article by profession a pharisie and vsest many outward washings but know this withall that vnlesse thou be washed inwardly by cleane water that is be regenerated and renewed by the holy ghost thou canst not enter into god kingdome lastly it is answered that the necessitie of saluation lies not in both but onely in the new birth by the holy ghost as if christ should say except ye be regenerate amp borne a new of the spirit which as cleane water purgeth and clenseth you from your sinnes ye cannot be saued the vse by this doctrine touching the necessitie of baptisme are iustly challenged two sorts of man the first is the popish sort who build the absolute necessitie of baptisme vpon false and vnstable grounds for they teach in their writings that all man are borne in sinne and corruption and vnlesse they be clensed from it they can neuer be saued now baptisme they say is appointed by god as the onely remedie and sole meanes whereby they may be purged from sinne and come to saluation and this they snew by a comparison of baptisme with the brazen serpent which as it was the only remedie for the cure of those which were stinged by serpents so is this sacrament the onely meanes set apart by god to keepe them that are partakers thereof from the sting of death and eternall destruction but the answer is plaine out of the former doctrine that though all man be conceiued and borne in sinne and cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen except they be clensed yet baptisme is not of absolute necessitie for this purpose for it is not appointed by god as the onely remedie of this euill but onely to be a signe and signification of the purging and clensing of sinne by the blood of christ now those that are within the couenant may haue their sinnes remitted by the mercie of god and that according to the forme of the couenat though they receiue not the signe thereof so be it they doe not wilfully contemne or neglect the same when it may be had againe the serpent lifted vp by moses in it selfe and by it owne vertue was a bare signe and was no remedie to cure the diseased israelites but they were cured by their faith in the word of god promise annexed vnto the signe according to which dauid saith he sent his word and healed them psalm and to the same effect augustine saith that the cure and health of the israelites came not from the serpent but from god commandement obeyed and his promise beleeued and so is baptisme a remedie and no otherwise the second is the common ignorant sort of people who thinke that an infant dying without baptisme dies without christendom and that it cannot possibly be a christian vnlesse it be baptised this their opinion is very erronious for by it they make baptisme the seale of the couenant to be as necessarie as the couenant it selfe whereas on the contrarie baptisme is not simply and absolutely necessarie so as the partie dying without it can not be saued but onely in part as it serues to distinguish the true church from the false to be a necessarie signe of our admission and entrance into the church yes to confirme our faith in the promise of god neither is baptisme of force to make a christian but onely to signifie and declare a man to be a christian by beeing within the couenant of grace to this there are giuen two answers first that the vse of godfathers and godmothers is not simply necessarie to the sacrament of baptisme for first it seemes that of auncient times the parents of children which were heathen and newly conuerted to christian religion were either ignorant and could not or carelesse and would not bring vp their children agreeably to the word of god and the religion which they newly professed and hence it was thought meet that some persons of good knowledge and life should be called to witnes the baptisme amp promise their care for the childrens education but now parents amongst vs beeing better taught and qualified the other is not of such necessitie secodly christ hath instituted and ordained in his word all things fitte conuenient and necessary vnto lawful baptisme amongst all which he hath not any where expressely prescribed the vse of sureties thirdly the whole congregation assembled together at the administration of this sacrament doe present the childe to the lord and are witnesses that the childe is admitted into the church and is externally in the couenant and therefore i take it to be a fault when the congregation doth depart before the child be baptized fourthly that which is required of them to promise and performe may ye must and ought to be performed of the parents of the baptized who are by the word of god to bring vp their children in the feare of god the second answere is that though such persons are not necessarie to the essence of baptisme yet they are not simply to be reiected this alway presupposed that they be fitte man and well qualified their fittenes stands in foure things first that they be of yeares of discretion sufficient to vndertake such a charge and therfore it is a fault when children are called to be godfathers and godmothers which neither are come to yeares of discretion nor able to consider what they doe or ought to doe secondly that they haue at least some knowledge and vnderstanding not onely in generall of the principles and grounds of religion but also of the nature and end of the sacrament and of the substance of the promise wherewith they bind themselues in the behalfe of their god children it was in ancient times required of such persons as were to be witnesses that they should know and vnderstand the creed and the lord praier therefore those are iustly to be blamed that call such persons to be witnesses to their children which though they haue yeares sufficient yet they haue little or no knowledge of the grounds of the catechisme or of the bond wherby they oblige themselues for the good and godly education of the infants in time to come thirdly they be knowne to be of an honest and reformed life not iustly chargeable of impietie incivilitie or dishonesty that by their example the children may in time to come be drawne to holines of life amp conversation for how can he that is of a dissolute and wicked life be able to bring others committed to his charge to the embracing of true religion fourthly that they be carefull to perform theirpromise made in the face of the church for the good education and instruction of the child in the feare of god specially when the parents be negligent and careles in that behalfe nor the reasons why these sureties are not to be simply reiected if they be qualified as hath beene said are these i because this custome though it be not directly grounded vpon scripture yet it is not repugnant thereunto for beeing righty vsed and kept it tendeth to the furtherance of religion and godlines in particular families and consequently to the edification of the church ii it is no new thing but an ancient comendable practize continued in the church of god aboue the space of yeares iii because these parties doe supply the defect of naturall parents when they be wanting either by death or by negligence while they liue if they be answerable to their promise made in the behalfe of the children touching the things that belong to their saluation yet further touching these persons three questions are mooued i q what dutie are they to doe in the behalfe of the party baptized ans papists teach that the principall and proper act of the suretie is the taking of the infant baptized from the hands of the preist into his owne armes and custody but this though it be an action neither good nor euill yet considering it may as well be done by another as by him and the doing of it by another is no whit preiudiciall to the ende for which such persons were first appointed in the church namely the good education of infants baptized it cannot be the principall dutie of the suretie but the things required of them are especially these i to be speciall witnesses of the admission and entrance of the partie baptized into the church of god ii to binde themselues by solemne promise in the name of the child before the whole church assembled that they will be carefull so soone as he comes to yeares of discretion that he be brought vp in the feare and seruice of god and be instructed in the principles of faith and repentance and acquainted with the promise made by them in his behalfe that he may frame his life thereafter iii to haue speciall care of the performance of their promise that by all good meanes which god hath appointed both publicke as hearing the word and receiuing the sacraments and priuate as exhortations and admonitions in time to come he shalbe moved and incited to forsake the deuill ampc and to pay his vowes made at his baptisme ii q whether children baptized come to be of spirituall kindred with the whole church by reason of their godfathers and godmothers the papists answer yes and they explane their answer in this manner looke as by carnall propagation a man hath a naturall beeing so by the sacrament of baptisme he hath a spirituall being in the state of grace according to which he is born againe now as by carnall propagation ariseth a bond of kindred betweene one man and an other so by the receiuing of baptisme there ariseth a bond of kindred betweene the members of the church by meanes whereof the sureties become as fathers and mothers to the parties baptized we on the other side answer negatiuely that persons baptized doe not by their baptisme become spiritually a kinne to the church now that this is the truth amp the contrary doctrine of the papist erronious will appeare by these reasons i the sacrament it selfe doth not giue a spirituall beeing to any man that is partaker thereof neither is it of force to make a man a christian or a member of the inuisible church of god but that which doth this is the couenant of grace wherein is promised remission of sinnes and life eternall in and by christ and the sacrament is only a seale of that couenant and no more now if baptisme cannot make a christian much lesse can it giue vnto him a spirituall beeing in the body of christ and consequently any such spirituall alliance whereby one member may be allied vnto another ii there is not the same reason of baptisme that is of carnall propagation or birth for baptisme is not regeneration it selfe but the sacrament that is the signe and seale of regeneration and therefore though naturall kindred comes by carnall seed and birth yet spirituall kindred cannot come to any by baptisme iii the scripture mentions onely two sorts of kindred and no more the one which ariseth properly from societie and communion of blood which we call consanguinitie the other which comes by carnall coniunction of man and woman in the estate of marriage commonly termed assinitie and besides these the scripture acknowledgeth none if it be said that god is the father of all beleeuers and that they are his sonnes and daughters and christ their elder brother and therefore there must needes be a spirituall alliance betweene them all i answer it is true but that this kinred hath his originall from baptisme and beginneth with that relation that is betweene the sureties and their god children in that sacrament it is a popish inuention deuised by the wit of man without ground or warrant in the word of god iii q but be it that the papists opinion were true then a further question may be mooued whether spirituall kinred contracted by baptisme can be a iust impediment of marriage betweene the witnesses themselues or their children the papists in their writings answer that spirituall alliance beeing farre more excellent then carnall is of much more force both to hinder a man from marriage before he marrie and to breake off marriage when it is consummate but this doctrine as the former is not warrantable for first they themselues affirme that this impediment doth not depend vpon the law of nature but vpon the iudgement of the church but the estate of marriage stands by god ordinance who hath giuen libertie of entrance into it to all man that are out of the degrees forbidden in his law without exception and therefore the lawes and constitutions of man cannot preiudice or take away any mans libertie in that behalfe secondly all beleeuers are brother and sisters in christ and therefore are spiritually allied each to other now if this spirituall alliance be polluted by marriage or maketh marriage vndertaken a meere nullitie then no beleeuer shall marrie in the lord for christians by this meanes must neuer match with christians but with pagan and infidells thirdly this impediment is a superstitious inuention of popish canonists onely to increase the treasurie of their church by their multitude of dispensations and it seemes that they are either ashamed of it or wearie to beare the imputation thereof for some of their owne canons are against it which doe allowe godfathers children to marrie and a man to marrie his godfathers wife and the coucell of trent hath drawn this affinitie into a narrower compasse which before was so farre inlarged allowing the witnesses themselues to be man and wife not vrging all the three kinds of kinred but onely some degrees of compaternitie for better resoluing of this question the ground of the answer is first to be laide downe and then the answer directly to be made there are two texts of scripture commonly alleadged concerning the force and vse of excommunication the first is matth the second is corinthian the scope of them both is to shew that the man which is excommunicated is barred from the kingdome of heauen for he is not to be holden a true member of the church but as a heathen and a publican and therefore is put out of god kingdome and deliuered vp to satan of this waight is excommunication nowe in excommunication there are three iudgements to be considered the first of god the second of the church the third againe of god the first is when god doth hold any obstinate sinner guiltie of his offence and consequently guiltie of condemnation vnlesse he repent this is the first sentence the second is the iudgement of god church vpon the offender after that god hath holden him guilty for the iudgement of the church followeth the iudgement of god and doth indeede nothing but pronounce the partie guiltie and subiect to condemnation and the difference betweene them both is onely this that god holds the offender guiltie and the church declareth him so to be now the second iudgement is not to be giuen absolutely but with condition of repentance and so farre forth as man can iudge by the fault committed as also by the word which giues direction how to discerne of the impenitencie of the sinner the third and last iudgement is god whereby he ratifies and confirmes that in heauen which the church hath done on earth and this in order followes the second this ground beeing laide downe i come now to the answer first therefore the parties excommunicate are in some respects no members of christs bodie and in some respects they are they are not in two regards first in that they are cut off from the company of beleeuers by lawful excommunication and so haue no participation with them either in prayer hearing the word or receiuing the sacraments the reason is for that the action of the church stands in force god ratifiing that in heauen which the church doth vpon earth secondly because by their sinne they haue as much as in them lieth depriued themselues of the effectuall power of god spirit which might rule and gouerno them but in other respects they are members as will appeare if we consider the diverse sorts of members some are members not actually and in present but in the eternall counsell of god and are to be in time when they shall be called thus was paul before his conuersion and therfore he saies of himselfe that god had seperated him from his mothers wombe and called him by his grace gal also of himselfe and other beleuers he saies when we were enemy we were reconciled to god by the death of his son rom some againe are members only in shew and appearance of which sort are hypocrites which seeme by their outward profession to be that they are not indeed wherin they reseble the wooden legge that is cunningly fastened to the body but indeede is no legge nor part of the body wherto it is adioyned a third sort are liuely members which are vnited vnto christ by faith and haue fellowship with god in him beeing iustified sanctified gouerned and preserued by his spirit and withall doe feele and shew forth the power of the same spirit dwelling in them of these paul speaketh rom as many as are lead by the spirit of god they are the sonnes of god the fourth sort are decaied members which though they belong to god election and are plants truly ingrafted into the vine christ iesus yet for the present haue not a liuely sense of the power and vertue of the spirit of christ in them these may fitly be resembled to the legge of a man or some other part that hath the dead palsie which though it remaine for some time without feeling and vncapable of nourishment yet beeing ioyned to the bodie it may by vertue of some strong medicine be recouered and made whole as the other of this sort are excommunicate persons for in regard of their ingraffing they are true members and can not be quite cut off from the bodie of christ ioh though otherwise they are not holden so to be in a threefold respect one in regard of man because they are excluded from their holy communion with the faithfull by the churches censure the second in regard of god because that which the church rightly bindeth on earth is boud in heauen the third in regard of themselues because for a time they want the power and efficacie of the spirit vntill they be throughly touched with repentance and beginne as it were to liue againe now though in these respects they be not esteemed members of the church yet the truth is they are not wholly cut off from the societie of the faithfull for the seede of faith remaineth in them and that knits the bond of coniunction with christ though the sense thereof be lost vntill they repent in this case the partie excommunicate is as a free man in bonds who vntill he get out of prison hath no vse of his freedome and yet continues a free man still though he remaine in prison so also the childre of god may still be the children of god though excluded from the cogregation of the church for some offences from this that hath beene said ariseth the answer to the question propounded namely that the children of such persons as are excommunicated are notwithstading their excommunication to be baptised because they are indeede and in the iudgement of charitie true members of the bodie of christ though in some other regards they are not in present holden so to be yet further besides the former grounds consider these reasons first children of parents that are professed members of the church though cut off for a time vpon some offence committed haue right to baptisme because it is not in the power of man to cut them off from christ though they be excommunicated secondly the personall sinne of the parent may not keepe the blessing from the child and therefore not depriue him of participation of the ordinance of god thirdly we must alway put a difference betweene them which doe not make separation from the church and yet are grieuous offenders and open apostataes that ioyne themselues with the enemy of the church to the ruine and ouerthrow of the truth of the gospel fourthly we must put a difference betweene those that haue giuen vp their names to christ though fallen grieuously and turks and infidel that are forth of the couenant and neuer belonged to the church lastly if the mercie of god inlarge it selfe to thousands yes to infinite generations why should man be so hard hearted as to make question whether such infants belong to the couenant and consequently keepe them from the sacrament of baptisme out of this question ariseth a second whether children borne in fornication haue right to baptisme ans they are not to be kept from it for the wickednes of the parent ought not to preiudice the child in things that belong to his saluation yet in this case some cautions are carefully to be obscrued as first that the parent hold the true faith and religion secondly that he be by the minister exhorted to a true humiliation of himselfe and to earnest repentance for his sinne committed and that before the child be baptized thirdly that their be some appointed to answere for the infant besides the parents and to make solemne promise openly to the church that it shall be carefully brought vp and instructed in the faith and the same is to be obserued and practized before the baptizing of the children of parents excommunicate the not obseruing hereof is the cause of many sinnes and corruptions in the liues of man it is commonly holden a great fault in ciuill matters for a man not to keepe his couenants much more is it a hainous sinne before god not to keepe the promises and pay the vowes made vnto him for answere therefore to the question wee must first take this for a ground that baptisme both for signification force vse and fruit continues not for a moment of time but for the whole course of a mans life it doth not respect onely the time past or present but that which is to come yes that whole time that a man hath to spend from the very act of his baptisme to his death againe baptisme is the true sacrament of repentance for remission of sinnes which being once receiued remaineth a perpetuall testimonie and pledge of the everlasting couenant of god and of the continuall washing away of sinne in the blood of christ this ground premised i come to the vse of baptisme which is two fold the first is that it serues to be a token and pledge of god fauour towards vs and that principally three waies first in that it sealeth and confirmeth to vs the free pardon and forgiuenesse of our sinnes thus cornelius was baptized of peter after he had heard the gospell preached and receiued the holy ghost that it might be vnto him a pledge of the remission of his sinnes act and in like manner doth peter exhort the conuerted iewes to repent them of their sins amp to receiue the sacramet of baptisme as a seale and pledge of god mercie in the forgiuenes thereof by christ act in regard of this vse baptisme is of great force to releeue the hart in distresse for when any childe of god feeles himselfe loden with the burden of his sinnes the consideration and remembrance hereof that god hath pardoned them all and giuen him a speciall and certaine pledge of his pardon in baptisme will serue to stay and support his soule yes though his sinnes were of force to make a separation betweene god and him yet remembring that his name is written in the couenant of god and that he hath by god mercie receiued the seale of the couenant he shall not neede to be much dismaied when satan tempteth him to doubt of his owne estate in regard of his corruptions even then let him haue recourse to his baptisme and thinke of the earnest and pledge of god fauour which he hath receiued let him draw out his euidences signed with the seale of god couenant made vnto him in iesus christ and that shall be sufficient to stoppe the mouth of satan and to repell his temptations secondly baptisme is as a pledge of the vertue of christs death doe you not know saies paul that all we which haue beene baptized into iesus christ haue beene baptized into his death rom for they that beleeue are by baptisme conformed to christ their head because they are by it buried together with him into his death verse this point is of excellent vse in our liues for it teacheth a man when his owne corruption mooueth him to sinne and he is now euen in the combate the spirit lusting against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit even then to call to memorie his baptisme wherein it pleased god to seale vnto him the mortificatio of his sinne by the power of christs death and consequently to pray earnestly vnto him for the continuance of the same power in his his heart for the continuall crucifiing of the old man and the vtter destroying of the body of sinne rom thirdly baptisme is a pledge vnto vs of the life of christ amp of our fellowship with him therein for looke as he beeing dead in the graue raised himselfe to life by his owne power euen so and more then so being now in heauen glorified doth he by the power of his deitie raise vp vs his mebers fro death to life rom a certaine pledge whereof he hath giuen vs in this sacrament which also affordeth singular comfort and ioy vnto a man euen in his greatest extremity true it is that man by nature is dead in sinne yet god of his mercie sealeth vnto him in baptisme his rising from the death of sinne to newnesse of life true it is againe that all man must die yet this is our comfort that in baptisme god hath sealed to vs euen our rising from the graue to life euerlasting and all by the vertue and power of christs resurrection this is a comfort of all comforts able to vphold the soule of man euen in the houre of death the second vse of baptisme is that it serues to be a notable meanes of our death vnto sinne and that three waies first by putting vs in minde of mortifying the flesh and crucifying our owne corruptions for if we be baptized into the death of christ as paul saith rom then ought we not to continue in sinne but to labour by all meanes as by praier by fasting by the word preached and by auoiding all occasions of offence to kill and destroy the corruption of our nature and the wickednes of our hearts gal secondly it causeth vs to dedicate our selues wholly vnto god and christ remembring that we once offered our selues to be baptized in the presence of the whole congregation in token that we should euer afterward consecrate our soules and body vnto the lord and wholly renounce and forsake the flesh the world and the deuill thirdly it causeth vs to labour to keepe and maintaine peace and vnitie with all man but specially with god people for baptisme is a solemne testimonie of the bond of mutuall loue and fellowship both of christ with his members and of the members one with another to this ende paul saith that we are all by one spirit baptized into one bodie corinthian yes and baptisme is one of those things whereby the vnitie of the spirit is preserued in the bond of peace ephesians answer he may if he repent and the reasons are these first his indentures and euidences remain whol in respect of god amp his name is not put out of the couenant which is otherwise in the evideces of man for if they be once cancelled a man cannot haue his name put into them againe secondly baptisme is indeede as hath beene said the sacrament of repentance and as it were a plancke or board to swimme vpon when a man is in danger of the shippewracke of his soule therefore if a man repent and be hartily sorie for his sinnes committed he may haue recourse to his baptisme wherein was sealed vnto him the pardon of all his sinnes past present and to come he standing to the order of his baptisme beleeuing and repenting thirdly to them that fall euen after baptisme there is hope of repentance and consequently of the fauour of god if they be touched in hart with true remorse and sorrowe for their offences for hence it was that paul calls the galatians fallen after they had beene baptized to the remembrance of the fauour of god promised vnto them in the couenant and sealed in their baptisme gal in the same manner doth john call the churches of asia that had left their first loue to repentance amp conuersion apocrypha and the said john in ecclesiasticall historie is said to haue reclaymed a young man who had most grieuously fallen after his baptisme of the lord supper thus much concerning the sacrament of baptisme now we come to the sacrament of the lord supper concerning the vse wherof there are two principal questions mooued for the answering hereof i propound three rules the first euery man of yeares liuing in the church and beeing baptized is bound in conscience by god commandement to vse the lord supper in the institution of the supper the lord gaue a sacramentall word whereof there be two parts a commadement amp a promise the comandement is expressed in these termes take eate drinke doe ye this and it binds all man in the church that are baptized to the vse of the lord supper the second rule euery man of yeares baptized is to receiue it often corinthian as oft as ye shall drinke it in remebrance of me the reason is because we haue need continually to feede on christ and herein the lord supper differeth from baptisme because by baptisme a man is once onely graffed into christ but being in christ he hath neede often and continually to be fedde in him to life eternall and this often nourishment of the beleeuer is sealed vnto him by the often vse of this sacrament the third rule euery man is to receiue and vse the lord supper according to the laudable custome of that church whereof he is a member vnlesse there be a iust impediment a iust impediment is that which barres a man from the vse of the supper as suspension contagious and incurable sickenesse absence vpon a iust and weightie cause as when a man is in his iourney and such like the reason of the rule is first if any man refuse to receiue it when he may conueniently hauing no iust impediment so doing he neglects and contemnes the ordinance of god secondly for a man to abstaine when he is called to receiue it though happily he may be excused in regard of some reason inwardly knowne to himselfe yet his abstinence is a bad example and may giue offence to others thirdly the man that may receiue and yet will not doth in effect suspend and withhold himselfe from the benefite of this holy sacrament now these three rules as they serue directly to answer the question in hand so they doe plainly discouer some errours amp faults in the practise of sundrie persons in these daies some there be that thinke it sufficient to receiue the communion once by the yere namely at easter time whereas on the contrary it is to be vsed as oft as may be considering that it is nothing but the shewing forth of the lord death till he come which is not once or twise in the yeare but often yes continually to be remembred others ther are that take liberty to theselues to com to this table amp abstaine at ther pleasure as if it were a thing arbitrary to themselues which notwithstanding the lord hath enioyned by expresse commandement as hath beene said but some alledge for this their practise that they are at variance with such and such persons that haue done them wrong and whom they cannot forgiue and in this respect they were better abstaine then come vnprovided to whom it may be said that their vnfitnes in this and other respects ought to be a strong motiue to induce them at least to vse all holy indeauour to prepare themselues euery day rather then a meanes to keepe them backe for if a man should abstaine vpon euery occasion of variance discontentment and infirmitie he should neuer receiue and so consequently haue no benefit by this ordinance of god daily preparation therefore is the more necessarie that when they be called and haue opportunitie they may come as welcome guestes vnto that heauenly banquet ans three things are required therevnto a right preparation a right receiuing and a right vse of it afterward that preparation is needefull the commandement of the apostle plainely shewes which is directed to al communicants without exception corinthian let a man that is let euery man examine himselfe now that a man may be rightly prepared hee must bring with him foure severall things first knowledge of the foundation of religion specially of the vse of both the sacraments that this is necessarie to preparation it appeareth by that which paul requireth in a good communicant corinthian to wit the shewing forth of christs death which is done by confession and thanks giuing and these two cannot be performed without knowledge the second thing required is faith for all sacraments are seales of the righteousnes of faith rom now faith is hereby discerned when the heart of the beleeuer contents it selfe onely with christ in the matter of saluation and doth beleeue not onely that there is a remission of sinnes in generall but that his sinnes are forgiuen to him in particular the third is repentance standing in a hearty sorrow for sinnes committed in a hatred and detestation of the same and in a resolued purpose of amendment and obedience for time to come here we must remember that renewed repentance for sinnes committed is principally required before the sacrament for the apostle chargeth the beleeuing corinthes with vnworthie receiuing because they came in their sinnes without renouation of their repentance the fourth is charitie towards man for this sacrament is a communion whereby all the receiuers ioyntly vnited together in loue doe participate of one and the same christ and therefore as no man in the old law might offer his sacrifice without a forehand agreement with his brother so no communicant may partake with others at this table without reconciliation loue and charitie now further touching preparation there are three cases of conscience to be resolued i case what shall a man doe if after preparation he finds himselfe vnworthie ans there are two kinds of vnworthines of an euili conscience and of infirmitie vnworthines of an euill conscience is when a man liues in any sinne against his conscience this we must especially take heede of for it is proper to the reprobate and he that comes to the table of the lord vnworthily in this sense questionlesse he shall eate his owne iudgement if not condemnation the vnworthines of infirmitie is when a man truly repents and beleeues and makes conscience of euery good dutie but yet sees and feeles wants in them all and in regard hereof himselfe vnfit to the supper such vnworthines cannot iustly hinder a man from comming to this sacrament neither is it a sufficient cause to make him to abstaine the reason is because the lord requires not therein perfection of faith and repentance but the truth amp synceritie of them both though they be imperfect if it be demanded how the truth of faith and repentance may be knowne i answer by these notes i if our faith be directed vpon the right obiect christ alone ii if there be a hungring and thirsting after his bodie and blood iii if wee haue a constant and serious purpose not to sinne iv if there follow a change in the life thus we read that many of the iewes in the daies of hezekias came to ierusalem and did eate the passeouer which had not clensed themselues according to that which was written in the law and yet for those among them that had prepared their whole hearts to seek the lord the text saies that god heard the praier of hezekias and healed the people though they were not clensed according to the purification of the sanctuarie chronicle ii case whether it be requisite to preparation that a man should come fasting to this supper ans it is not necessarie for in the primitiue church christians did first feast and at the ende of their feast receiued the lord supper and if receiuers bring with them attentiue mindes reuerent and sober hearts it matters not whether they come fasting or not the kingdome of god stands not in meates and drinkes as paul saith rom iii case whether such persons as are at contention and goe to law one with an other may with good conscience come to the lord table the reason of the question is because man thinke when they goe to law that they doe not forgiue ans there be three kinds of forgiuenes of reuenge of the penaltie and of iudgement ofreuenge when man are content to lay aside all hatred and requitall of euill of penaltie when beeing wronged they are content to put the matter vp and not proceede to reuenge by inflicting punishment of iudgement when a man is willing to esteeme and iudge things badly done as well done and to iudge a bad man no euill person nor an enemie though he be an enemie of these three the first is alwaies necessarie a man is bound in conscience to forgiue the reuenge and leaue that to the lord to whome vengeance properly belongeth but to the forgiuenes of penaltie and iudgement we are not alway bound we must shunne and decline iniuries offered as much as possibly we can but when they be offered we may with good conscience seeke a remedie of them and vse any lawful meanes to defend our selues therefore i answer to the question thus that if a man going to law with an other forgiues him in regard of reuenge when he comes to the lord table he doth his dutie for doing that he is not bound to the other as hath beene said the second thing in the right vse of the lord supper is the right receiuing of it wherein there be two things required first the renewing of our knowledge or generall faith and then secondly the renewing of our speciall faith in christ let the reason of both be obserued this sacrament cotaines many particular signes as not onely the bread and wine but the actions about the same the signes may be thus distinguished some of them are representing signes some are signes applying representing signes are such as doe liuely set forth vnto vs christ with his benefits as the bread and the wine the breaking and the powring applying are those that doe appropriate the same as the giuing and receiuing of the bread and wine the first sort serues properly to renew our knowledge the second to confirme the saine by application now answerable to the scope of the sacrament must be our right receiuing which consisteth in renewing of our knowledge and faith in the mysterie thereof our knowledge is renewed principally by meditation in the vse of the supper after this manner first when we see two signes to be receiued we must call to minde that christ is our perfect sauiour that is both bread and water of life secondly when we behold the bread and wine set apart by the minister and consecrated by repeating the promise and praiers made for that ende we must remember that christ was ordained and appointed by god to be our mediatour and sauiour ioh act thirdly when we see the bread broken and wine powred out we are to meditate of christ that was crucified for vs and broken both by the first death and paines of the second whereby life and righteousnesse was procured vnto vs fourthly the giuing of the elements into the receiuers hands offers vnto our meditation thus much that god doth truly and really giue christ with his merits and efficacie to euery beleeuing receiuer on the otherside our faith is renewed by apprehension and application in this manner when the minister giues the bread and wine and the communicant receiues them at the same time are we to lift vp our hearts to heauen to apprehend christ by faith beleeuing him with all his benefits to be ours that he was made man for vs that he suffered and died for the remission of our sinnes for these outward symbolicall or sacramentall actions serue to no other end but to signifie vnto vs these inward actios of the mind and will whereby we apprehend and receiue christ to our saluation here by the way two cases are propounded i case what is to be done if a man after often receiuing still doubteth whether he hath faith or no ans he must striue against doubting and indeauour to beleeue being heartily sory for the weakenes and infirmitie of his faith and let him withall consider and remember that god hath not onely giuen his promise but set apart this sacrament to be a special signe and pledge of his mercie contained in the promise for the vpholding amp strengthening of mans faith but some man will say mine indeauour is nothing if doubting preuaile ans it is not so for if a man can be heartily sorie for his infirmitie if he striue to beleeue if in heart he hungreth and thirsteth after christ faith is begunne and he in some sort doth apprehend christ the poore begger by the high way side enioyeth the almes that is giuen him though he receiue it with a lame and leprous hand the stomacke that lothes physicke if it receiues into it at the first but one droppe of the potion prescribed and that in very weake and fainting manner it will be able at length to take benefit by a greater quantitie and in the meane time it receiues good the man that is in close prison if he sees but one little beame of the sun by a small crevisse by that very beame he hath vse of the sun though he seeth not the whole body of the sun in like manner though our faith the hand of our soule be mingled with weakenes and corruption though we feele neuer so little measure of god grace in vs yes though our knowledge be neuer so small yet it is an argument that the spirit of god beginnes to worke in our harts and that we haue by god mercie begunne to lay hold on christ it will be said further if i feele not christ giuen vnto me by god i doe not nay i cannot beleeue answer in nature it is true that experience beginnes first and then followes assurance but in spirituall and diuine things there is a contrary course to be taken for here we must beginne with faith and in the first place simply beleeue god promises and afterward we come by the goodnes of god to feele and haue experience of his mercie this point was notably practised by iehosaphat who beeing in a great extremity and seeing no way to escape practised his faith in the first place and said lord we know not what to doe but our eyes are towards thee chro and the like he taught the people at the same time ver put your trust in the lord and ye shall be assured thus abraham is said aboue hope to beleeue vnder hope the promise of god euen against sense reason and experience rom ii case if in the very instant of receiuing a man feele his heart so hard that he cannot lift it vp vnto god what is then to be done ans first hardnes of heart is two fold sensible and insensible the insensible hardnes of heart is a great and dangerous iudgement but the sensible and felt hardnes which is in god children and which they feele and bewaile in themselues is rather a blessing then a curse of this the people of god complained esay and it must not discourage any communicant but rather comfort him because it is a signe of grace for if ther were no grace in the heart corruption amp hardnes could not be felt secondly i answer that the benefit of the sacrament is not tied to the very instant of receiuing but if before and after a man lift vp his heart to god he shall find comfort though for the present he hath not so liuely sense and feeling thereof as he desireth this alway provided that the same partie be displeased with himselfe that he cannot doe that which he would and ought nor in that measure that is required and such a one must consider this to his cofort that though he doe not apprehend christ yet christ apprehendeth and accepteth him in the third place after the receiuing of the sacraments two things are required first that thankes be giuen vnto god not onely in word but in euery action of our life for christ and all his benefits secondly that not onely for the present but euer afterward still we renue our faith repentance and obedience but what is a man to doe if after receiuing he finde no cofort ans first he must examine whether he hath truly beleeued and repented yes or no if he hath not then the fault is in himselfe and not in god ordinance if he hath let him not be dismaied for the ioy of the spirit is sowne in his heart and though it lie hidde for a time yet at length it will shewe it selfe psalm of adoration the fourth head of the outward worshippe of god is adoration wherein we consider two things first what it is secondly what be the questions propounded concerning it for the former adoration in generall is an outward worship signifying and testifying the inward worship of the heart more specially by it we must conceiue the bowing of the head and knee the bending and prostrating of the bodie the lifting vp of the hands eyes and such like adoration is two fold religious or civill religious adoration is that worship of god in which religion and godlines is exercised expressed and signified in it there be two things alwaies ioyned together and yet distinctly to be considered the first and principall beeing the foundation of all the rest is the intention of the minde whereby god is conceiued as an absolute and omnipotent lord knowing all things yes the heart of man hearing the praiers of all man in al places at all times the author preseruer and giuer of all good things the second depending vpon the former is the outward prostrating of the bodie as the bowing of the knee and such like for this ende to testifie our subiection vnto god as our absolute lord ampc this is it which makes adoration a true religious worship the other kinde of adoration is civill pertaining to the second table tearmed by some sociall because it is the adoration or worship that fellow creatures giue one to another and this as the former hath in it two things the one is the intention of him that performeth it which must be this that the creature worshipped is induced with excellent gifts of god or that he hath a power of gouernment ouer vs for one of these two is euer the ground of ciuill adoration the other is the action or outward gesture of the bodie in token that the creature worshipped is indued with excellent gifts and graced with authoritie before named here we must remember that the bowing of the bodie ampc and in generall all bodily gesture performed is one and the same both in religious and ciuill worship and the distinction standeth onely in the intent of the minde now the questions about adoration are two ans we must distinguish the things that are and they be of three sorts or rankes in the first ranke comes god the creator in the second the creatures in the third the work of the creatures for the first adoration that is due to god the creator must not be sociall for we are not god mates and companions but onely religious yes all religious worshippe is due to god and to him alone which i prooue thus the devill when he tempted our sauiour desired no more of him but the prostrating of his body yet vpon this ground that he was the giuer and disposer of all the kingdomes of the earth but christ denies it and answers thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onely shalt thou serue math again the very scope of religious adoration is to acknowledge the godhead and the properties thereof and herevpon it must be giuen to god alone and consequently not to the creature vnlesse we will acknowledge a godhead in the creature here we are to remember two caueats touching religious adoration first if adoration be giuen to the true god with a false and erronious intention it makes him an idol for example if the body be bowed with this intent to worship god out of the trinitie as the turke doth or if he be worshipped out of the son with the iew thus doing wee worship not the true god but an idoll the reason is because god is so to be conceiued of vs as he hath manifested himselfe in his owne word and no otherwise if otherwise god is not conceiued but an idoll or fiction of the braine and the adoration is not done to god but to the idoll secondly to worship god in at or before an image is idolatry amp superstion and god so worshipped is made an idoll for he that thus worshipps him bindeth his presence operation and grace to those places to which god never bound himselfe or his presence ampc god hath not appointed images to be pledges of these things either by promise or commandement hence it followeth that the man which worships god otherwise then he would be worshipped or lookes to be heard when god will not be heard is an idolater againe god expressely forbids the the worshippe of his maiestie in at or before any creature in heauen or in earth deut but the idolater in excuse of his sinne is wont to pretend many things first that whe he worshippeth he intends not to worshippe the image but god in the image to this we answer that it matters not what his meaning is for let him intend what he wil if god detesteth that manner of worshippe it is not to be tendred vnto him in any sort the israelites worshipped not the calfe it selfe but god in the calse exod yet then moses saith that they worshipped an idoll secondly he alleadgeth that in the old testament god was worshipped before the arke and that there he promised to heare the praiers of his people ans the reason is not alike for they had an expresse commandement giuen them by god touching adoration before the arke and a promise that they should be accepted and heard but the idolater hath no such commandement or promise thirdly he obiecteth that subiects doe kneele downe before the chaire of estate in the absence of the king or queene in token of subiection due vnto them and therefore much more may they to the images of god and saintes in heauen glorified answer this reason is also insufficient for the kneeling before the chaire of estate is a meere civill testimonie of ciuill worshippe and beeing referred to this end to shew loyaltie and subiection to lawful princes it stands in force by the commandement of god but there is no such warrant from god word for bowing to images neither is it his will that they should be tokens and pledges of his presence the second sort of things that be are the creatures which must be distinguished into foure kindes i wicked spirits ii good angels iii liuing man iiii man departed touching wicked spirits or devil the question is what is the adoration that is due vnto them ans they are the enemy of god and accursed of him therefore no honour or seruice belongs vnto them by his will and appointment and for that very cause we are to haue no dealing with them at all nay we are vtterly to renounce and abandon whatsoeuer things come from the deuill or his instruments as namely all spells charmes inchantments ampc which serue to the working of wonders and yet haue no such vertue giuen them from god for that end either by creation nature word or institution now concerning the good angells if they did now appeare vnto vs and we had certaine knowledge thereof we might adore them but how onely with ciuill and sociall worshippe for so we read gen that lot seeing twoo angels comming towards sodome rose vp to meete them and bowed himselfe with his face to the ground by which example it appeareth that though angels may be adored yet not with religious or that which is mixed with religious worship but with worship purely amp meerely ciuill wherevpon it was that the angell refused the worship done vnto him by john saying see thou doe it not i am thy fellow servant and one of thy brother ampc reverand i adde moreouer that since at this day the angels appeare not vnto vs we may not worshippe them at all either in ciuill or religious manner albeit we must euer haue a reuerent estimation of them as for liuing man adoration meerely civill is onely due vnto them and that in respect of the gifts of god which we see to be in them as also of their authoritie and place which they haue amongst man this is expressely inioyned in the fist commandement honour thy father ampc and confirmed also by the example of abraham who stood vp and bowed himselfe before the people of the land of the hittites gen prouided alwaies that this adoration be according to the laudable custome of the countrey where they liue but for worship either simply religious or mixt it is in no sort to be yeelded them thus peter when cornelius met him and fell downe at his feete refused to accept of the honour done vnto him which notwithstanding was not a diuine but a mixed kinde of worship performed vnto peter in a reuerent opinion of his person as beeing more then an ordinarie man act in like manner mordecai the iewe denied to worship haman because the honour which the king appointed to be giuen vnto him was an excessiue honour hauing some diuine worship in it such as was done to himselfe of the same sort is the kissing of the popes feete which indeede is ciuill worship but mixed with religious for it is tendered vnto him as to the vicar of christ and one that cannot erre the like to which is not done to any emperour or potentate on earth lastly touching dead man or saints departed as peter paul and the rest all the worship we owe vnto them is no more but a reuerent estimation of their persons and imitation of their es religious or ciuill adoration due vnto them we acknowledge none because neither we haue to deale with them nor they with vs therefore roman adoration of them we renounce as flat idolatry considering it giues vnto them a diuinitie making them present in all places to know our hearts and heare our praiers at all times which is the prerogatiue of god alone now for vnreasonable creatures no adoration at all appertaineth to them but onely a reuerent and holy vse of them for adoration is a signe of subiection of the inferiour to the superiour but man is their superiour and therefore he is to doe them no worship or seruice and hereupon we iustly condemne the adoration of the reliques of saints of the bread and wine in the sacrament ampc the third sort of things is the worke of the creature to wit images where if it be demanded what adoration is due to them i answer none at all reasons we haue an expresse inhibition to the contrarie in the third commandement thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor worship them ampc the superiour must performe no adoration to the inferiour now though it should be granted that they were the images of god yet man is a more excellent image then they and they are inferiour not onely to him but euen to the baser sort of creatures the wo e is one of the basest creatures vpon the earth yet it is a worke of god the image is a worke not of god but of man man therefore may as well in all reason and better worship the worme then the image of outward confession the fift head of god outward worship is confession i meane not the ordinarie or ecclesiasticall confession but that which is made before the aduersarie concerning which there be many questions commonly made ans that confession is necessarie it appeares by manifest testimonies of scripture pet be readie to giue an answer alwaies to euery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you here is a flat commandement for confession againe rom if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth and beleeue with thy heart thou shalt be saued for with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteousnes and with the mouth man confesseth to saluation and mark whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me in this adulterous generation of him shall the son of man be ashamed also when he commeth in the glorie of his father with his holy angels this is graunted of all diuines saue onely of some pestilent heretikes the second part of the question is when confession is to be made for answering whereof this must be remembred for a ground that there is a distinction to be made betweene commandements affirmatiue and negatiue the negatiue bindeth at all times and to all times for it is not lawful at any time for a man to doe euill the affirmatiue binds at and in all times but not to all times for it commands a dutie to be done which neuerthelesse is not at all times to be done for example to giue almes is prescribed by an affirmatiue commandement and yet almes are to be giuen onely at fit times and occasions hereupon it pleased the lord to propound part of the morall law in negatiue tearmes because negatiues are of greater force now confession beeing commaunded not by a negatiue but by an affirmatiue commandement we are not bound thereunto at and to all times but when iust occasion is offered what then may some say are the especiall times in which confession is to be made before the aduersarie ans there are two principally to which all the other may be reduced the first is when we are examined touching our religion by them that are in authoritie as by magistrates princes iudges ampc for at such time we are lawfully called to make confession of our faith and may doe it with boldnes thus much the place before named importeth where we are inioyned to be readie to giue an account ampc pet that is not to euery examiner but to those alone who haue power and authoritie giuen them by god for that purpose and the same is implied in christs speech to his apostles math and ye shall be brought before gouerners and kings for my sake in witnes to them and to the gentiles and in this case not to make profession of our faith is in effect to denie christ to scandalize the church and greatly to preiudice the truth the second time of confession is when in the want thereof god glorie is directly impeached the saluation of man hindered and our neighbour offended and then we are necessarily to confesse though no examination be made if it be here asked how we may be able to discerne of this time the answer is by christian wisdome which teacheth vs that when by our silence wicked man are emboldened to speake euill of god word and weake ones occasioned to fall from the faith then is the fittest time to stand in the defence and maintenance of the truth out of these two times and cases christians haue libertie not to confesse but may lawfully conceale their faith nay which is more their persons by changing their habit and attire vppon this ground because the affirmatiue commandement doth not alwaies binde here it is obiected first that we are saued onely by faith and therefore confession is not necessarie ans we must consider faith two waies first as an instrument created in the heart whereby we apprehend and apply christ with his benefites to our selues for our iustification and saluation secondly faith must be considered more largely as it is a way to bring vs to life euerlasting nowe in the first acceptio it may truly be said that we are saued by faith alone for there is no grace of god where by we take hold of christ but faith but if we take it in the second sense as a way to life then we may truly say that it alone saueth not but hope loue repetance good works and all diuine vertues in this sense paul saith we are saued by hope rom because by it we wait for our saluation and hope is the way in which all must walke that looke to be saued againe he saith momentany afflictions doe work vnto vs an eternall waight of glory corinthian but how not as causes but as waies signes and markes that giue vs direction to our iourneies ende and thus the woman is said to be saued by bearing of children tim which bearing and bringing vp of children is no cause but onely a way wherein she must constantly walke to glory and though in mans iudgement that may seeme a way of misery and death yet indeede it is otherwise if the children continue in faith loue and holinesse with modestie againe the apostle iames saith that abrahams faith wrought together with his workes iam which are likewise not to be vnderstood as working causes but as testmonies and euidences declaring and manifesting that he was iust in the sight of god secondly it is obiected that confession of our faith to god is sufficiet for so saint paul seemes to say rom hast thou faith haue it with thy selfe before god therefore confession before man is not needefull ans the apostle speakes not of that faith wherby we are iustified and saued but of that which standeth in a perswasion of the vse or not vse of things indifferent and this a man may keepe to himselfe that is he may so vse it as he shall not thereby offend his brother that commandement was giuen by paul for those times when man were not fully perswaded of the vse of god creatures as meates drinkes ampc but to these times it is not ans it is not and i proue it by the scope of the eigth and tenth chapters of the first epistle to the corinthians where the apostle disputes the question whether the corinthians might goe into the temples of idols and eate of meat offered vnto them in the meane time not partaking with idolaters in the worship of the idols this he auoucheth to be vtterly unlawful amp for that purpose tells the corinthians that they cannot drinke of the cuppe of the lord and of the cuppe of deuills now as this was unlawful for them so it is unlawful for any protestant to goe to any popish assembly to heare masse again god is the creator of the body and soule therefore he is to be worshipped in both amp cosequently we robbe him of his due when we reserue our hearts to him and giue our body to idolls to this purpose paul exhorteth the romanes to giue vp their body a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable vnto god rom which place vtterly condemneth the errour of some who thinke that god wil be content with the soule and that they may bestowe there bodie in the seruice of the devill but against this doctrine sundrie things are alledged the first is the example of naaman kings who said to the prophet when i bowe my selfe in the house of rimmon the lord be mercifull to me in this thing to whom elisha answered goe in peace here say some the prophet giues leaue to naaman to worshippe in an idols temple to this there be sundrie answers giuen some affirme that naaman speakes only of ciuill and politic worship and not of religious for his office was to kneele down in the temple that the king might leane vpon his shoulder when he worshipped the idoll and naaman makes open protestation v that he will worshippe no god but the god of israel others answere and that more truly that naaman doth acknowledge it a sinne to goe to the house of rimmon and therefore he craues pardon for it at the hands of god twice togither ver and withall makes a vowe that he will thenceforth offer neither burnt offer nor sacrifice to any other god saue onely to the lord and hereunto elisha answereth goe in peace yet further it is answered that naaman requesteth the prophet to pray for him that he might be constant in the seruice of the true god and in case he were drawne against his purpose by humane frailtie to bow againe before rimmon with his king that the lord in mercie would pardon his offence and to this the prophet yeeldeth saying goe in peace as if he should say goe to i will pray for thee to this ende and purpose this text therefore giues no warrant for bodily presence in idolatrous assemblies the second obiection iehu openly professed the worship of baal and yet he dissembled meaning nothing lesse king and the lord commends him for his diligent execution of that which was right in his eies verse ans iehu is commended not for his dissembling but for his diligence in destroying achabs house his religion amp the priests with all that belonged vnto them though in other matters belonging to the seruice of god he departed not from the sinnes of ieroboam the third obiection daniel nebuchad nezzar made a decree that whosoeuer would not fall downe and worshippe the golden image should the same houre be cast into the middest of an hotte fierie furnace now we doe not read that any moe refused to obey but three and therefore it seemes that daniel did worship the image as well as others ans daniel was not accused as the three children were and for that cause there is no mention made of his refusall againe put the case he had beene accused yet the king tooke no knowledge of his accusation because he was in fauour both with him and the people the fourth obiection paul togither with foure man that had made a vow yeelded to purifie himselfe according to the lawe of moses because he would not offend the weake iewes act and yet that law concerning purification as also the whole bodie of ceremonies was abrogated in the death of christ now if he might doe that which was unlawful for the auoiding of offence why may not a man goe to masse and so preuent the scandall which may be taken on the behalfe of the papists ans it is true that there was an end put vnto the ceremoniall lawe by christs death yet it was not at the first wholly to be abolished but by little and little againe the vse of ceremonies remained as a thing indifferene in it selfe till the temple of ierusalem was destroied by titus and the church of the new testament throughly planted and till both these were accomplished the vse of the ceremonial lawe was no sinne provided that it were not holden or vrged as a thing necessarie to saluation now whereas it is saide that we may be present at the masse for the auoiding of offence it may further be answered first that we are to doe our duties though man be neuer so much offended for it was the rule of christ in like case let them alone they be the blind leaders of the blind matth secondly we ought not to doe euill that good may come thereof the fift obiection the masse is god ordinance appointed by christ though now it be corrupted by man ans it is a most damnable idol yes worse then any idol of the gentiles and the adoration performed therein is most abominable and hath more affinitie with grosse gentilisme then with the institution of our sauiour christ this question consisteth of two parts touching the first sundrie man are of opinion that it is vtterly unlawful to flie in persecution as tertullian who hath written a whole booke of this argument and besides him certaine heretikes named circumcelliones in that part of afrike which we now call barbarit and some also of the sect of the anabaptists but the truth is that sometimes it is lawful to flie though not alwaies for proofe whereof consider these reasons first christs commandement matth when they persecute you in one citie flie into an other if it be saide that this commandement was limited to the times wherein the aposties preached in iewry and therfore is temporarie i answere no for there cannot any text of scripture be brought to shew that it was euer yet repealed and the apostles who had receiued this commandement euen after christs ascension and the giuing of the holy ghost being persecuted did flie from one place to another as we may read act corinthian if it be alleadged that if this be a commandement to flie then all must ie i answere againe that though the commandement be generall to all persons and therefore euery christian may lawfully shunne apparent danger yet the same is particular in regard of circumstances of time and place for though all may flie yet there be some places and times wherin man may not vse that libertie as shall appeare afterward the second reason is taken from the example of many worthy man recorded in scripture iacob the patriarch fled from the presence of his brother esau into haran to laban gen and againe from thence to the land of his fathers gen moses after he had slaine the aegiptian fledde out of egypt into madian where he liued yeares exod and this was no rash flight but a worke of faith heb obadiah the gouernour of ahabs house hid a hundreth man of the lord prophets by fiftie in a caue and fed them with bread and water when iezabel would haue destroyed them king eliah being in feare of his life fled from iezabel into mount horeb king againe in the n testament our sauiour christ being in danger withdrew himselfe john and that sundry times till the hower of his passion was come paul when the iewes tooke counsell together to kill him was let downe by the brother in a basket through a wall in damascus act and when the grecians went about to slay him hee was brought by the brother to cesarea and sent to tarsus ver againe being in danger he vsed christian pollicie to saue himselfe for by saying he was a pharisee he made a diuision betweene his accusers the pharisies and sadduces and so escaped act and if that were lawful for him to doe then is it also lawful for a man by flight to saue himselfe in case of danger whether he be a priuate man or a pastor yet for the better clearing of the answer some allegations to the contrarie are to be examined obiection i persecution is a good thing and that which is good may not be eschewed ans good things are of two sorts some are simply good in and by themselues as vertues and all morall duties and these are not to be eschewed some againe are good onely in some respects of this sort are things indifferent which he neither comanded nor forbidden but are good or euill in respect of circumstances and these may be eschewed vnlesse we know that they be good for vs now persecution beeing of this kind that is to say not simply good but onely by accident may be auoided because no man can say that it is good or bad for him obiect ii persecution is sent of god for the triall and good of his church ans first euill things sent of god may be auoided if he shewe a meane or way how they may be auoided for example god sendeth sicknes famine the plague and sword he sends also meanes and remedies for the preuenting and remoouing of them as physicke and foode ampc and these we may lawfully vse for the said purposes and in like manner may persecution be auoided if god offer meanes of escape secondly there is a twofold will of god his reuealed and his secret will by his reuealed will he hath appointed that in case of present daunger when meanes of escape be offered they may be vsed now because they that flie lawfully are assured of god reuealed will therefore in obedience thereunto they vse the meanes to saue themselues from danger as for his secret will because it is vnknowne and therefore vncertaine vnto vs we may not rashly presume thereof and against his expresse will refuse the meanes offered but vse them rather till god reueale the contrarie obiect iii to flie in persecution is a kinde of deniall of christ and against confession he therefore that flies seemes to make no confession but rather to denie christ ans christian confession is double open or implicit open confession is when a man boldly confesseth his faith before the aduersarie euen to the death this is the greatest and highest degree of confession and in it the holy martyrs in former times continued euen to the losse of their liues vndergoing the punishment of death inflicted vpon them by the aduersaries of christ iesus for the maintenance of the truth implicit is when a man to keepe his religion is content to forsake his countrey friends and goods this is a second degree inferiour to the former and yet it is a true confession acceptable to god and vnder this kind comes flight in persecution whence it appeareth that lawful flight in times of danger is no deniall of christ nor yet against confession for sometimes it pleaseth god to call man to professe his name and truth openly by suffering sometimes againe not openly by suffering but by flying amp this latter way though it be not so high a degree as is the former yet it is indeede and in truth in the measure a true profession of christ and pleasing vnto god obiect iv our sauiour christ commands vs feare not them that can kill the bodie matth now if a man must not feare them then he must not flie ans the text speaketh not of all feare but of such feare as tendeth to apostasie and causeth man to renounce faith and good conscience againe it speakes of that feare whereby man feareth man more then god thirdly it speakes of such feare as by which a man is vrged to tempt god by doing some thing that is repugnant to his will and that out of his calling now when the question is of flight in persecution we vnderstand not such a flight as tendeth to apostasie or argueth the feare of man more then of god or that is repugnant to god will but that alone whereby we vse the meanes offered according to his appointment least we should seeme to tempt him and bring vpon our selues vnnecessarie danger and thus the first part of the question is answered the second is concerning the time when a man may flie minister or other and for better resolution thereof we are to remember that there be eight conditions required in christian flight especially that which pertaines to the minister the first is if there be no hope of doing good by his abode in that place where the persecution is but while he conceiues any hope of doing good by teaching preaching or otherwise he may not flie this the minister shall easily discerne in christian wisedome to this purpose paul act hauing a while preached at corinthian and finding that the iewes detested him and his ministerie intended a present departure thence but the lord appearing vnto him by night in a vision warned him to stay for saith he i haue much people in this citie that is many that are to be conuerted and brought vnto the faith euery minister in his place must haue a speciall care of furthering god kingdome whether it be by flying or not flying the second condition consideration must be had whether the persecution be personall or publique personall is that which is directed against this or that mans person publique which is raised against the whole church if it be directed against the person of the pastor he may vse his libertie for it may be that his flight will bring peace to the ch but what if the people will not suffer him to flie ans they should be so farre from hindering of him in this case that they ought rather to succour and releeue him thus when demetrius had raised a tumult against paul vnder pretence of diana amp he would haue presented himselfe vnto the people in the common place the disciples suffered him not act and what care they had of his preseruation the same ought the people to haue of their pastor in case of like perill but if the persecution be common to the whole church then he is not to flie for it is necessarie at such times especially that those which are strong should support and confirme the weake the third condition if there be in the pastor a moderation of minde for he must take heede of these two extremities that he be neither ouercome with excessiue feare nor through ouermuch confidence runne headlong into apparent danger and that he may auoide these extremities he must first pray vnto god for wisdome courage and constancie and secondly vse the consent and aduise of the church for his direction in this behalfe that all things may be done in wisdome the fourth condition of lawful flight is that the minister withdraw himselfe onely for a time amp not vtterly forsake his charge and calling yes if he be principally aymed at in the persecution he may lawfully goe apart and it is the dutie of the church also to see him conuaied away in safetie till the persecution be ouer and thus doing he neither forsakes the church nor his calling but onely vseth the meanes of his preseruation for the keeping of faith and a good conscience this warrant our sauiour giues to his apostles matth when they persecute you in one citie flie into another the ende of that commandement was that the apostles might preserue themselues in safetie till they had preached the gospel to all the cities of israel as the next wordes doe declare the fift condition if after due triall and examination he finde not himselfe sufficiently armed with strength to resist or beare the extremitie for then he may retire himselfe into some place of safetie where he may liue to the glorie of god keeping faith and a good conscience the sixt condition is if he be expelled or banished by the magistrate though the cause be vniuft for subiection is simply to be yeelded to the punishments and corrections of magistrates though we doe not alwaies tender obedience to their commandements the seauenth is if god offer a lawful meanes and way of escape and doth as it were open a doore and giue iust opportunitie to flie in this case not to flie especially if he haue not strength sufficient to stand out is a tempting of god the eight condition if the danger be not only suspected surmised and seene a farre off but certaine and present otherwise the pastor falles into the sinne of ionah who fore casted dangers in his calling and therefore preuented them by flying to tarsus these conditions being obserued it may be lawful both for pastor and people to flie in times of persecution in the next place it may be demaunded when a pastor or other may not flie for answer herevnto the signes of unlawful flight are to be considered and they are principally foure the first is when god puts into a mans heart the spirit of courage and fortitude whereby he is resolued to abide and stand out against the force of all enemy thus paul act went bound in the spirit to ierusalem where though he knew that bonds and afflictions did abide him yet he would not be disswaded but vttered these words of resolution i passe not at all neither is my life deare vnto my selfe so that i may fulfil my course with ioy and the ministration which i haue receiued of the lord iesus to testifie the gospell of the grace of god this motion of the spirit is not ordinarie yet in the time of hot persecution it hath beene found in many worthy instruments of god glory as may be seene in the history of sundry martyrs in the daies of queene mary but one especially of whom i was credibly informed that hauing this motion not to stand out and yet flying for that very act felt such a sting in his conscience that he could neuer haue peace till his death the second signe is when a man is apprehended and vnder the custodie of the magistrate for then hee is not to flie because he must in all his sufferings obey the magistrate here a question is mooued whether a man that is imprisoned may breake prison to this popish schoolemen answer that he may if the cause of his imprisonment be vniust and sutable to this assertion is the common practise of papists we on the contrary say and that truly that no man being in durance may vse any unlawful or violent meanes to escape for we may not at any hand resist the magistrate in our sufferings servant are commanded to subiect themselues with patience vnto the vniust corrections of their maisters pet and this reason is giuen for it is thankeworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure greife suffering wrongfully the apostles being in prison vsed no meanes to deliuer themselues but when the angell of the lord had opened the prison dores then they came forth and not before act and that which peter and the other apostles did must pastors and other man also doe in the like case for religion sake the third signe when a man is bound by his calling and ministerie so as in it he may glorifie god and doe good to the church by preaching the he must not fly for the duties of a mans calling must be preferred before any worldly thing whatsoeuer whether body goods friends or life ampc the fourth signe when god in his providence cuts off all lawful meanes and waies of flying he doth then as it were bidde that man stay and abide i say lawful meanes because we may not vse those that are unlawful but rather rest contented and resigne our selues wholly to god will and pleasure wee must not doe any euill that good may come thereof and of two evills not onely not the lesse but neither of both is to be chosen so much of confession of an oathe the sixt head of god worship is an oath concerning which three questions are to be handled an oathe is a religious and necessarie confirmation of things doubtfull by calling on god to be a witnesse of truth and a revenger of falshood first i call it a confirmation for so the holy ghost speaketh an oath for confirmation is among man an ende of all strife heb secondly i terme it a religious confirmation because an oath is a part of god religion and worshippe yes it is sometimes put for the whole worshippe of god esay in that day shall they swear by the lord of hosts that is they shall worship the true god thirdly i adde a necessarie confirmation because an oathe is neuer to be vsed in way of confirmation but onely in case of meere necessitie for when all other humane proofes do faile then it is lawful to fetch testimonie from heauen and to make god himselfe our witnes in this case alone and neuer els it is lawful to vse an oathe fourthly i say in which god is called vpon as a witnes of the trueth and a reuenger of falsehoode this is added in the last place because herein alone stands the forme and life of an o the that in things doubtfull we call god as a witnes of truth and a iust revenger of the contrary there be sundry kindes of confirmatio as the affirmation the asseueration and the obtestation and by this clause an oath is distinguished from them all because in it we call vpon god to giue witnesse to the thing avouched but in the other three we doe not now touching this last point of the forme and life of an oathe three questions are to be answered for the better clearing of the whole doctrine i question whether an oathe taken by creatures be a true oath and to be kept ans an oathe by creatures is an oath though unlawful for though there be not in it a direct invocation of god for witnesse yet when we call the creature to giue testimony we doe then indirectly cal vpon god because he is seene in them and looke how many creatures there be in the world so many signes are they of god presence this answer christ himselfe maketh matth he that sweareth by heauen sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon that is by god himselfe ii question whether an oath by false god be a true oath or no for example the oath of the turke by muhammad the oath of laban by the god of nachor that is by his idols when as in them there is no inuocation of the true god of heauen and earth i answer as before though it be not a lawful oath yet it is in value amp effect an oath for though that thing be a false god indeed by which it is taken yet it is the true god in the opinion of him that sweareth thus muhammad is to the turke in stead of the true god and is honoured of him as god and therefore his oath by muhammad is a true oath thus when iacob in the couenant that he made with laban sweares by the feare of his father isaac and laban by the idols of nachor iacob accepted the oath which was tendered to him in the name of a false god which he would not haue done if it had not beene an oath at all and hence the case is plaine that swearing by a false god is an oath and therefore bindeth the swearer in conscience thought it be vnlawfully taken iii question if in euery oath god ought to be cited as a witnes how then can god sweare by himselfe seeing none can witnes vnto him ans this description of an oath whereby the creature sweareth includes not that oathe whereby god sweareth for the ende why god sweareth is to binde himselfe as it were with a bond vnto man whereby he would haue man to repute him a lier and no god if he failes and keepes not his promise thus the lord sweares in his wrath hebr if they shall enter into my rest the words of the oath are to be vnderstoode with this clause if ampc then let me be holden as no god or as a false god and in this manner is god said to sweare when he manifesteth to man that he is content to be counted no god if that which he auoucheth by oath be not performed furthermore in every oath there be foure distinct things first an asseueration of the truth which should be avouched though there were no oath taken secondly a confession or the omnipotent presence wisedome iustice and truth of god whereby we acknowledge that he is the searcher and knower of the heart yes that he is both witnesse iudge and reuenger of falshood and lying thirdly prayer and inuocation whereby god is called vpon to giue testimonie to the conscience of him that sweareth that he speakes nothing but the truth these two actions of confession and invocation doe make an othe to be no lesse a true and proper part of god worshippe then praier it selfe fourthly imprecation in which a man acknowledging god the the iust reuenger of a lie bindes himselfe to punishment if he shall sweare falsely or speake an vntrueth wittingly or willingly now though these be the distinct parts of an oath yet all of them are not expressed in the forme of euery oath but sometimes one sometimes two of the principall and the other concealed but yet alwaies vnderstood for example the prophet ieremie teacheth the people of israel a forme of swearing thou shalt sweare the lord liueth ierem in which there is expressed onely the second part confession and in that the rest are to be vnderstood againe the words of ruth to naomi the lord doe so to me and more also if ought but death depart thee and me are onely an imprecation in which the other parts are infolded so the othe which god maketh heb if they shall enter into my rest is expressed onlie by imprecation and the other parts vnderstood though they be not mentioned in common speach betweene man and man it is vsually avouched though most wickedly if it be not thus or thus let me be banged i would i were dead i would i might neuer mooue hence ampc now this auouchment howsoeuer it may be taken is indeed a form of swearing in value and force all one with the oath of god when he saith if they enter into my rest let me be no god but a deceiuer sometimes two parts of the foure are expressed and the rest vnderstood corinthian now i call god to record vnto my soule here invocation with imprecation is vttered in speach and the other two conceiued in the minde by these particulars we see it vsuall in scripture to propound formes of swearing by expressing some one or two particular parts in stead of the rest yet so as the parts concealed be all vnderstood for otherwise the othe is not formalland entire for the answering hereof two rules are to be remembred the first rule he that will take an oathe by the name of god must sweare in truth in iudgement in righteousnesse ierem here three vertues are required in a lawful oathe first that it be made in truth and wee must know that there is a double truth the one of the thing spoken the other of the minde wherein it is conceiued truth of the thing is when a mans speech is framed according to the thing as it is indeede or as neare as possibly may be and that because god is truth it selfe this is called by schoolemen logical veritie sometimes by reason of mens frailtie this truth is wanting because we know not things as they are the truth of the minde is when a man speakes or sweares as he thinketh or is in conscience perswaded of the thing and this the schoolemen tearme morall veritie now though the first of these two be wanting yet the latter must necessarily be in an oath least we fall into periurie the second vertue is iudgement that is prudence or wisdome this iudgement requires discretion and consideration principally of fiue things first of the thing in question which is to be confirmed secondly of the nature of the oath that is taken thirdly of the minde and true meaning of him that sweareth fourthly of the particular circustaces of time place amp persons when where and before whome he sweareth fiftly of the euent or issue of the oath all these are duly to be regarded that we sweare not rashly or vnaduisedly the third is iustice wherein also care must be had of two things first that the point to be confirmed be lawefull and it is then lawful when it may stand with pietie and charitie secondly that the occasions of taking the oath be also iust and they be chiefly foure i when it may further god glorie and worship or serue to prooue some doctrine of saluation in whole or in part ii when it may tende to the furtherance of brotherly loue or to the preseruation of our neighbours life goods or good name or further to the confirmation of some league couenant or contract made betweene parties vpon good ground and for good and necessarie purposes iii when it serueth to releeue a mans owne priuate necessitie as when one sweares to maintaine his owne good name goods or life to confirme his owne faith and truth in contracts an example hereof we haue in paul who to confirme the romanes in the perswasion of his loue and care of their saluation saith god is my witnesse whome i serue in my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you rom and againe to keepe his owne credit and good name among the iewes i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience bearing me witnesse in the holy ghost rom iv when the magistrate doth exact it by order of iustice this though it be a iust occasion and warrant of an oath yet three caueats are in it to be obserued first that the oath be administred lawfully not against pietie or charitie secondly he which takes an oath tendered by the magistrate must sweare according to the minde and meaning of the magistrate who exacts the oath and not according to his owne priuate intent thirdly he must not sweare ambiguously but in a simple sense so as the words of his mouth may be agreeable with that which he conceiueth in his heart psalm and whatsoeuer oath is taken without obseruation of these caueats the same is not taken in truth but in fraud and deceit popish teachers affirme that in some cases they may sweare in a doubtfull meaning and this they practise in time of daunger when beeing conuented before the magistrate and examined they answer yes in word and conceiue a negation or no in their mindes a practise most impious and flat against this excellent rule of the prophet that a man should sweare in truth iudgement amp iustice the second rule is that the forme in which the oath is propounded must be a plaine simple and direct forme wherein god is directly called to witnesse for his worship is directly to be giuen to him and therefore the oath also beeing an inuocation of his name and a part of his worship is directly to be made that the meaning of this rule may the better appeare one question is to be answered whether in the forme of an oath a man may not sweare directly by creatures and indirectly by god most of the popish sort and some protestant hold that he may but the truth is otherwise i say vnto you saies our sauiour sweare not at all neither by heauennor by the earthnor by thy head ampc matth in which words he forbids all indirect oathes whereby man sweare directly by creatures and indirectly by god for so did the pharisies againe if a man might sweare by creatures and conceale the name of god it would diminish his maiestie and authoritie and much deceit might be vsed for the swearer might say that he sware not but only vsed an obtestation against this it is obiected i that ioseph sware by the life of pharaoh gen therefore it may seeme that oathes by creatures are not unlawful ans first it may be said that ioseph sinned in so swearing for therein he imitated the egyptians who sware by the life of their king secondly it may be answered that ioseph doth onely make an asseueration and not an oath obiect ii the church in the canticles takes an oath by the creatures cant i charge you daughters of ierusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field ampc ans it is no oath but an obtestation wherby the church calls the creatures to witnesse her earnest affection to christ the like is made by moses de when he saith i call heauen and earth to record against you this day and by paul in his charge to timothie tim i charge thee before the elect angels in which and the like speeches there is no swearing but a kind of citation or summoning of the creatures as witnesses and there is great difference betweene an oath and an obtestation in the obtestation there is no more but a calling of the creature to giue testimonie the matter beeing already apparent and manifest but in an oath where the matter is not so manifest god is made not onely a witnesse but also a iudge and reuenger obiect iii saint paul sweares by his reioycing in christ corinthian which reioycing was a created passion or a creature ans that was also an obtestation or a word of auouchment and asseueration and not an oath for it is all one as if he had said thus my sorrowes and afflictions which i indure for christ would testifie if they could speak that as certenly as i reioyce in christ so certenly i die daily obiect iv abigail sware to dauid by the creature as the lord liueth and as thy soule liueth sam ans the former part of her speech may be called an oath but the latter is onely an obtestation or earnest auouchment ioyned with an oath now although it be in no sort lawful to sweare by creatures yet when a man sweareth directly by god he may name the creatures in way and forme of an oath specially if he make them as his pawnes and pledges set before god that he may in iustice be reuenged vpon him in them if he lieth and sweareth not a truth the answere to this question is large and therefore for orders sake i distinguish it into two parts and first i will shew when an oath bindes secondly when it bindeth not for the first an oathe taken of things certaine lawful and possible is to be kept yes and bindes alwaies though it bee tendred even to our enemy to this purpose god hath giue special commandement in sundry places numbers whosoeuer sweareth an oath to bind his soule by a bond he shall not break his word but shall doe according to all that proceeds out of his mouth mat thou shalt not forswear thy selfe but shalt performe thine oathes vnto the lord exod thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vaine that is lightly and rashly but god name is taken in vain when an oathe made of things lawful and possible is not kept dauid at the humble request of shimei who had before cursed him pardons his fault for the time amp sweares to him that he should not die sam dauid made conscience of this oathe knowing himselfe to be bound thereby and therefore till his death he kept it onely hee charged solomon not to count him innocent king now for the better clearing of the answer we are to consider four particular cases touching this point i case what if a man take an oath by false god whether is he bound to keepe it yes or no ans he is and the reasons are these first from the like there was a question among the scribes and pharises matthew whether a man swearing by the creature were a debter or no the pharisees taught that if a man sware by creatures the oathe did not binde but christ verse affirmeth that he that sweares by the temple or by the altar or by heauen sweares by god indirectly amp so takes an oathe though not a lawful oath and thereupon remaines bound and is a debter now by propotion he that sweares by false god sweares by god indirectly because the false god is in the opinion of him that sweares a true god and so his oath bindeth and is to be kept secondly abraham accepts the oathe that abimelech tendreth vnto him in the name of a false god gen so doth iacob accept of the oathe made vnto him by laban gen which they would not haue done if their oathes had not beene sufficient bondes to binde them to obseruation and performance it will be said he that admits of an oathe by an idoll doth communicate in the sinne of him that sweareth ans in case of necessitie a man may admitte of such an oath without sinne a poore man beeing in extreame want borroweth of an vsurer vpon interest it is sinne to the vsurer to take it but it is not so in the poore man who is compelled by the vsurer to giue interest thus the poore man doth vse well the iniquitio of the vsurer so it is in an oath a godly man may well vse and take benefite by the wicked oathes of idolaters so farre forth as they shall serue for the ratifying and confirming of lawful couenants ii case if a man take an oathe and afterward endure hurt or dammage by it whether is he then bound to keepe his oath or no ans if the losse he but temporary and priuate the oath beeing made of a thing lawful it must be indured for dauid reckoneth it among the properties of a good man that he sweareth and changeth not though it be to his hurt psalm and here a difference is to be made betweene a promissorie oath and a single promise a single promise may be reversed by the will and consent of him to whom it is made but a promise made by an oath is to be kept though losses and hinderances ensue therevpon for the reuerence we beare to the name of god vsed in the oathe ought to be of greater force with vs then any priuate hinderance or inconueniece which may befall vs vpon the performance of the same iii case whether doth an oath binde conscience whereunto a man is drawne by fraud and subtiltie ans if the oath be of things lawful and possible it bindeth and is to be kept though we were induced to it by deceit ioshua deceiued by the gibeonites was brought to make couenant of peace with them and to bind it by an oath now perceiuing after three daies that they had wrought it by craft he would not touch them in reuerence of the oath that he had taken iosh and about years after whe saul had slaine certaine of the gibeonites the israelites for that fact were punished with three yeares famine which could not be staied till seauen persons of sauls house were hanged vp in gibeah sam iv case what if a man take an oath by feare and compulsion is he to keepe it yes or no for example a man falling into the hands of theeues for the safetie of his life is vrged to take a solemne oath that he will fetch and deliuer them some portion of money and withall neuer disclose the parties the oath beeing thus taken the question is whether he be bound to keepe it ans some diuines are of opinion that the oath is to be kept and some say no but generally it is answered that it must be kept because this feare did not abolish the consent of his will but if it be alleadged that in so doing he shall hurt the common wealth answer is made that if he doe not sweare secrecie he may in probabilitie bring greater damage to the weale publike in depriuing it of a member by the losse of his owne life but it will be saide by this meanes he maintaines a theefe ans be it so yet he remaines excusable because that was not his intent but onely to preserue his owne life to the good of the common wealth thus the most and best diuines doe hold but for my part i leaue it in suspense though it seemes in likelihood that the partie which sweares silence doth after a sort maintaine theft and communicate with the sinne of the robber and further giues occasion that others may fall into the like hazard and ieopardie of their liues and so much of the first part of the answer the second part of the answer to this third maine question followes namely to shew when an oath bindes not an oath doth not binde in sixe cases i when it is against the word of god and tends to the maintenance of sinne the reason is because when god will not haue an oath to bind it must not bind for an oath must not be a bond of iniquitie hereupon dauid hauing sworne a rash oath to destroy nabal and his house and beeing staied from it by the lord in the meanes of abigail he praiseth god in this manner blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meete me and blessed be thy counsell and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood sam ii if it be made against the wholesome lawes of the commonwealth because euery soule must be subiect to the higher powers rom iii if it be taken of such persons as want reason as of children mad man or fooles because they know not what they sweare and there can be no binding of conscience when he that sweareth wanteth reason to discerne what he doth iv if it be made by those who are vnder the tuition of their superiours and haue no power to binde themselues as by children which are vnder the gouernment of their parents for these are part of their parents goods and therefore not fit to vndertake an oath without their consent neither are they to choose a calling or make any contract of themselues but onely by the direction and aduise of their parents though some of the popish sort do erroniously teach that a child may binde himselfe by oath to become a monke of this or that order without consent of parents v if it be made of things impossible for then it is a vaine oath vi if at the first it were lawful and afterward become impossible and unlawful for such oathes god himselfe may be said to reuerse thus if a man bind himselfe by oath to liue in single life without marriage and after findes that god hath not giuen him the gift of continencie in this case his oath becomes impossible to be kept and therefore beeing reversed by god and becoming vnlawful it may be broken without impiety to these sixe the papists adde two other the first when the oathe is made vpon custome and they put this example if two man going out of a dore or ouer a bridge the one sweares by god that he will not goe first likewise sweares the other yet at the last after contention one of them goes first in this case saies the papist the othe bindes not ans custome cannot make that which is sinne to be no sinne or periurie to be no periurie but rather doubles the sinn amp makes it aboue measure morevile amp abhominable and they that giue themselues to this vsuall and customable swearing cannot but oftentimes become guiltie of flat periurie the second case is when the superiour power that is the pope or other inferiour bishops giue order to the contrarie by relaxation or dispensation ans it is falfe for in euery lawful oath there is a double bond one of man to man the other of ma to god now if in the oath taken man were onely obliged to man the oath might be dispenseable by man but seeing man when he sweareth to man sweareth also to god and therby is immediately bound to god himselfe hence it followeth that an oath taken cannot haue release from any creature therefore our sauiour christs commandement is thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe but shalt performe thy oathes to whome to the lord math and the oath that passed betweene dauid and ionathan is called the lord oath sam and sam god will haue the oath to binde as long as seemeth good vnto him yes and cease binding when it pleaseth him and that which himselfe bindeth or will haue to be bound no creature can loose the things which god hath coupled let no man separate math and herein the pope shewes himselfe to be antichrist in that he challengeth power to dispense with a lawful oath made without error or deceit of things honest and possible out of this answer another question may be resolued namely when doth a man commit periurie ans when a man sweares that which he knowes to be false when he sweares that which he meanes not to doe when he swearing to doe a thing which he also meanes to doe yet afterwards doth it not in these three the not performing of an oath made it flat periurie that we may yet be informed concerning the sinne of periurie one question of moment is to be skanned in societies amp corporations there be lawes and orders to the keeping whereof euery one admitted to an office takes a corporall oath afterward it falls out vpon occasion that he breakes some of the saide statutes the question is whether he be not in this case periured ans statues are of two sorts some are principall or fundamentall which serue to maintaine the state of that bodie or corporation others lesse principall or mixt that serue for order or decencie in the statutes principall the lawmaker intends obedience simply and therefore they are necessarie to be kept but in the lesse principall he exacts not obedience simply but either obedience or the penaltie because the penaltie is as much beneficiall to the state of that body as the other the breach of the former makes a man guilty of periurie but it is otherwise in the latter so be it the delinquent party be content to beare the mulct if it be imposed thus students and others belonging to such societies may in some sort excuse themselues from the sinne of periurie though not from all fault in breaking some of the less locall statutes els few could liue in any societie without periurie yet one more question is propounded touching periurie whether a man may exact an oath of him whome he feares or knowes will forsweare himselfe ans a priuate man must not but a magistrate may if the partie offer to take his oath not beeing vrged therto and be first admonished of the greivousnesse of the said sinne of periurie in the execution of ciuil iustice magistrates must not stay vpon mens sinnes moses expected not the israelites repentance for their idolatry but presently proceeded vnto punishment neither must the publicke good of the common wealth bee hindred vpon the likelyhood or suspition of a mans periurie of vowes the seuenth head of the outward worship of god is concerning a vowe all the questions whereof may be reduced to these foure ans a vowe is a promise made to god of things lawful and possible i call it a promise to distinguish a vowe from a single purpose for a purpose may be chaunged but a vowe lawfully made cannot againe there is great difference betweene these two for in a vowe there is first a purpose to doe a thing secondly a binding of our selues to doe that we pupose for this cause i tearme it a promise because it is a purpose with a bond without which there can be no vowe made in the next place i adde a promise made to god not to saint angel or man the reasons are these first a vowe is properly the worke of the heart consisting in a purpose now god alone knowes the heart and he alone is able to discerne of the purpose and intent of the same which no angel saint or other creature can possible doe secondly when the vow is made none can punish and take revenge of the breach therof but god thirdly in the old testament the iewes neuer vowed but to god because the vowe was a part of god worshippe deut when thou shalt vowe a vowe vnto the lord thy god thou shalt not bestack to pay it for the lord thy god will surely require it of thee and so it should be sinne vnto thee where by the way we may take notice of the superstition of the popish church that maketh vowes to saints and angels which is in effect to make the god amp to worship the as the iewes worshipped god in the old testament the answere is threefold first if a vowe be taken for a promise of morall obedience the answer is that a vowe is indeed the worship of god and so shal be to the ende of the world for as god for his part promiseth mercie in the couenant of grace so wee in baptisme doe make a vowe and promise of obedience to him in all his commandements and therefore peter calleth baptisme a stipulation that is the promise of good conscience to god this promise once made in baptisme is renewed so oft as we come to the lord supper and further continued in the daily spirituall exercises of invocation and repentance but it may be said we are already bound to the obedience of the law by order of diuine iustice therefore we cannot further binde our selues ans he that is bound by god may also bind himself dauid though he was boud by god in conscience to keepe the law yet he binds himselfe freely by oath to helpe his own weaknes amp to keepe himselfe from falling when he saith i haue sworne and will performe it that i will keepe thy righteous iudgements psalm and the same bond is no lesse necessary and behooffefull for vs if we consider how prone and readie we are to fall from the worshippe of god the second answere if a vowe be taken for a promise of some ceremoniall dutie as of sacrifices and oblations or of giuing house lands and goods to the temple then we must put a difference betweene the olde testament and the new in the old testament the vow of such duties was part of god worshippe but in the newe it is not and that for these reasons first the iewish ceremonies were to the iewes a part of god worshippe but to vs gentiles they are not cosidering they are all in christ abolished and none of them doe now stand in force by god law to vs thus the passeover was a ceremonie or seruice appointed by god to be obserued of the israelites and their posteritie exod and therefore stood as a part of god worshippe to them for a perpetuall ordinance but to vs in the new testament both it and other legall ceremonies are abrogated and we haue onely two sacraments to be administred and receiued as seales of the promises of god and parts of his worshippe baptisme and the supper of the lord secondly that which is not commended vnto vs by god in the name of worshippe is no worshippe to vs now the ceremonies of the iewes are no where commended vnto vs in that name and therefore it is a vaine thing for any man to vowe the obseruation thereof thirdly vowes of ceremoniall duties did in a peculiar manner and vpon speciall respects pertaine to the iewes hereupon when they vowed house lands goods ampc to the vse of the temple this they did as beeing the lord tenants of whome alone they helde their possessions and hereby they acknowledged and also testified their homages and seruices due vnto him and this particular respect concerneth not the church and people of the new testament whence it followeth that they are not tyed by the same bond to performe worship vnto god by the vowes of ceremonies gifts oblations and sacrifices the third and last part of the answer if a vowe be taken for a promise of some bodily and outward worke or exercise as fasting giuing of almes abstaining from certaine meates and drinkes ampc then it is not any part of god worship but onely an helpe stay and furtherance of the same for first we haue libertie of conscience in christ to vse or not to vse all indifferent things now god worship is not a thing of that nature but absolutely necessarie secondly paul tim affirmeth that bodily exercise profiteth little but godlines is profitable for all things in which words he opposeth godlines to bodily exercise and therefore godlines or the worship of god consisteth not in them but the words of dauid are alleadged to the contrarie psalm vowe and performe vnto the lord your god where we haue a double command one to make vowes another to pay them to which i answer first if dauid speaketh of the vowe of all moral duties then the commandement concerneth euery man because the thing commanded is a part of god worship for it is as much as if he had said vow thankefull obedience vnto god and performe it againe if the place be meant of the vow of ceremoniall duties then it is a commandement peculiar to the old testament and so bindes the iewes onely howbeit not all of them but onely such as had iust cause to make a vow for otherwise they had libertie to abstaine from vowing deut when thou abstainest from vowing it shall be no sinne vnto thee of one of these two kinds must the place alleadged necessarily be vnderstoode and not of the third which is of bodily exercise for then it should reuerse christian libertie in the vse of things indifferent which no commandement can doe by light of this answer we may discerne the errour of the popish church which maketh vowes a part of religion and the worship of god nay further it teacheth that some vowes as namely those of pouertie continencie regular obedience to this or that order are workes of merit and supererogation tending to a state of perfection euen in this life and deseruing a further degree of glorie in heauen then the worke of the morall law before i giue answer to the question i will lay downe this ground in making of a lawful vow foure conditions are to be obserued the first concerneth the person of him that voweth that he be a fit person his fitnesse may be discerned by two things first if he be at his owne libertie as touching the things whereof he makes his vow and not vnder the gouernment of a superiour thus in the old testament if a daughter had made a vow without the consent or allowance of her father it might not stand in effect numb secondly if the partie keepe himselfe within the compasse of his calling generall and particular hence it followes that vowes of going a pilgrimage to worship this or that idol in this or that place for example s iames of compostella and the ladie of loretto ampc are vtterly unlawful because such persons by this practise doe leaue their calling and condition of life and take vpon them a calling not warranted by the lord the second condition is concerning the matter of a vow it must be lawful possible and acceptable to god hereupon it followes that there be foure things which cannot be the matter of a vow the first is sinne thus the iewes bound themselues with a vow that they would neither eate nor drinke till they had killed paul act this their vow was nothing els but a threatning of god himselfe and therefore vtterly unlawful secondly trifles and light matters as when a man voweth not to take vp a straw or such like and this is a plaine mocking of god thirdly things impossible as to flie or to go on foote to ierusalem fourthly things meerely necessarie as to die which cannot be auoided the third is touching the forme of a vowe it must be voluntarie and free and that it may be so three things are necessarily required first that it be made in iudgement that is with reason and deliberation next that it be done with consent of will and thirdly with libertie of conscience hence it appeares that the vowes of children mad man and fooles or such as are taken vpon rashnes or constraint also the vow of perpetuall abstinence from things simply indifferent are all vtterly unlawful for the first sort are not done vpon iudgement the next without due consideration and the last are greatly preiudiciall to christian libertie the fourth concernes the ende which is not to be a part of god worship but onely a stay and proppe to further and helpe vs in the same nowe there be three particular ends of a vow first to shew our selues thakfull to god for blessings receiued secondly to preuent sinne to come by keeping so brietie and moderation thirdly to preserue and increase our faith prayer repentance and obedience this ground beeing laide the answer to the question propounded is this when in vowing we obserue the conditions prae required the vow is lawful and consequently binds the partie vowing so as if he keepe it not he dishonoureth god but when the saide conditions doe not concurre in the action of vowing it becomes unlawful and the partie remaineth free and not bound to performance here by the way a question of some moment is made whether iephte vpon his vow did offer his daughter in sacrifice or no considering that it is plaine euen by the light of nature as also by the doctrine before taught that a man is bound by the vow which he maketh this question admitteth sundrie answers according to the diverse opinions and iudgements of man vpon the place written iudg and my purpose is not to examine that which others haue brought in way of resolution but briefly to deliuer that which i take to be the truth i answer therefore that iephte did not offer his daughter in sacrifice vpon his vowe but onely dedicated her vnto god after the manner of the nazarites to the ende of her daies to lead her life apart in a single estate the truth of this answer will appeare by these reasons first in the verse of the chapter the daughter of iephte craues leaue of her father to goe apart into the mountaines for two moneths space to bewaile her virginitie where it may be obserued that she went not to deplore the losse of her life but her future estate and condition because shee was vpo her fathers vow to liue a perpetuall single life and why surely because as the text saith verse she had not knowne a man amp it was accounted a curse in iudea for a woman alwaies to liue vnmarried secondly in the last verse it is said in our common english translation that the daughters of israel went yeare by yeare to lament the daughter of iephte but i take it it may be as well or better translated out of the hebrue they went to le thannoth so it is expounded by the hebrewe doctors quintil in iud talke or conferre with her and so to comfort her and that this interpretation may not seeme strange the very same word is obserued in this sense iudg there shall they talke or conferre of the righteousnesse of the lord now if they went yeare by yeare to comfort her then shee was not put to death thirdly iephte is commended by the holy ghost for the excellencie of his faith heb and that out of the same historie now the commendation of his faith and the vnnaturall murther of his daughter cannot stand together but it will be said that iephte vowed that whatsoeuer came out of his dores to meete him should be the lord amp he would offer it for a burnt offring v ans the words may more truly be read thus or i will offer it in sacrifice and the meaning of the vowe was this that thing which first meeteth me if it be a thing to be sacrificed i will sacrifice it if not i will dedicate it to the lord for it seems to consist of two parts wherof the latter is coupled to the former by a discretiue coniunctio as the gramarians speake in this manner the word is els where taken so as it may either way be expounded in the fourth commandement exod in our common translation it is read thou and thy son and thy daughter but out of the ebrwe it may be translated either and or or it will be said againe that iephte rent his cloathes because his daughter mette him when he returned from the victorie ans that was in regard of her vowed virginitie which was a curse among the iewes and besides he had but one daughter and by this meanes of sacrif ing her all hope of posteritie after him was cut off but it seemes that monasticall vowes of virginitie by this example are lawful ans indeed the custome of vowing virginitie beganne in those dayes but they thought it not a state of perfection but rather an estate of miserie as may appeare in that he rent his cloaths when she mette him and the daughters of israel went to comfort her as being now in a woefull and miserable estate vpon these reasons i conclude that iephte did not offer vp his daughter in sacrifice but onely set her apart to liue a single life to the honour and seruice of god and iephte might knowe euen by the light of nature that it was a finne to vow h daughters death and a double sinne to kill her to this the papists answer affirmatiuely placing the greatest part of their religion in practise and observance of these vowes that we may know them the better they are in number three the first is the vowe of continency whereby a man renounceth mariage for euer and voweth vnto god perpetuall virginitie the second of voluntarie povertie which is when a man giueth ouer all propertie of his goods and bindes himselfe to liue by begging the third is of regular obedience when a man resignes himselfe in conscience to be ruled by another and to keepe some deuised order in all actions and duties pertaining to religion now the question beeing whether these vowes binde or no i answer in a word they doe not and that for these reasons i first they are flat against the law of god which i make manifest in the particulars the vowe of perpetuall chastitie is expressely against god commandement corinthian if they cannot abstaine let them marry for it is better to marrie then to burne to this text the papists answer three waies first they say that this place of scripture is onely a diuine permission and not a commandement we reply againe directly that it is a plaine commandement for the intent of the holy ghost in that text and in the whole chapter is to ordaine a necessarie remedie for incontinencie which paul calls burning and for the auoiding of fornication which brings destructio to the soule and for that purpose he speaks not in permitting maner but in imperatiue tearmes let the marry secondly they answer that the words concerne onely incontinent persons that commit fornication we on the other side affirme that they are not only giuen to them that liue incontinently but to all persons which are subiect to burning which burning may be without incontinencie for the better vnderstanding whereof let it be considered that there be three distinct degrees of lust in man the first is when the temptatio is first receiued into the mind the secod when the same temptation preuaileth though with some resistace amp trouble of the minde amp conscience which also though no outward offence as yet follow is a degree of burning the third is whe the temptation so far preuaileth that the heart amp will are overcome and the duties of religion for the time vtterly hindred this is the highest and worst kind of burning and if we consider these degrees well it will easily appeare that there may be burning without incontinent liuing thirdly they answere that this text speaketh not of persons that are free but of those alone who are bound from mariage by solemne vow we contrariwise affirme and hold that the words are generall and plainly directed to all persons bound by vowe or otherwise and that appeares by verse where he saies i speake not this to tangle you in a snare these words doe shewe that pauls mind was touching the vow of perpetuall virginitie for he leaues euery man according to god ordinance to his owne libertie willing none by vowe to binde himselfe from the vse thereof now for the vow of regular obedience that also is against the word of god corinthian ye are bought with a price be not the servant of man where the apostle forbiddes vs to subiect our hearts and consciences to the lawes and ordinances of man in matters of religion and consequently ouerthroweth the vowe of regular obedience for in that a man bindes himselfe to be ruled in all things belonging to god worship according to the will and pleasure of his superior yes to eate drinke sleepe to be cloathed ampc according to a certaine rule giuen and prescribed by him whereas in regard of conscience we are bound onely vnto god lastly the vowe of voluntarie pouertie is also a plaine abuse of god owne ordinance and appointment deut that there should be no begger in israel but it may seeme that this law is not perpetuall for in the new testament we read that there were beggers as namely one that was laide at the gate of the temple daily to aske almes act ans this law neither was then nor is now abrogated by god but the obseruation of it at that time and since was much neglected and the neglect of prouision for the poore is the cause of begging and the vowe of perpetuall pouertie still remaines as a manifest breach of god holy ordinance notwithstanding any thing that may be pretended to the contrarie ii the second reason followes monkish vowes as they are against god commandement so are they also against the libertie of conscience which we haue by christ touching the vse of the creatures and ordinances of god as riches mariages meates drinkes and apparell stand fast saith the apostle in the libertie wherewith christ hath made you free gal againe let no man iudge you in meat or in drinke or inrespect of an holy day coloss in these places there is granted vnto man a free vse of all things indifferent so it be not in case of offence now in monkish vowes those things which god hath made indifferent and put in our libertie are made necessarie whereas no ordinance of man can make things simply necessarie and parts of god worship which he himselfe hath made indifferent and left free to the will of man and hence it was that the forbidding of meates and mariage were tearmed by the apostle the doctrine of deuills tim but will some say doth not the ciuill magistrate in our common wealth forbid the vse of some meates ans he doth but by his commandement he takes not away the libertie that we haue in the vse of things indifferent but doth onely moderate it for the common good which he may doe lawfully iii the third reason some of them are out of the power and abilitie of him that voweth as the vowe of perpetuall chastitie in single life for our sauiour saith all man cannot receiue this word but they to whome it is giuen matth that is continencie is a gift of god whereof all man are not capable but those onely to whome he giueth it when and as long as it pleaseth him neither is it denied vnto some because they wil not but because they are not able against this the papist obiecteth that we may receiue any good gift of god if we pray for it for christ hath saide aske and ye shall receiue matth ans it is false god gifts are of two sorts some are common to all that beleeue and necessarie to saluation as faith repentance obedience the feare of god some againe are speciall gifts not giuen to all nor needs full to saluation but peculiar onely to some as health wealth continencie single life ampc now the promise of our sauiour aske and ye shall receiue is meant of things necessarie to saluation and not of particular and speciall gifts for some may pray for them and yet neuer receiue them thus paul praied thrise that the pricke in his flesh the messenger of satan might be remooued from him yet he was not heard nor his petition graunted and why because that which he prayed for was not a common gift necessarie to saluation but a speciall grace for the time of the temptation wherewith he was presently assaulted whereupon answer was giuen my grace is sufficient for thee and hence we learne in what manner to aske things at the hands of god when wee pray such as are necessarie to saluation we may aske absolutely and simply but things that are lesse necessarie with this condition if it may stand with the good will and pleasure of god againe the papist alleadgeth an example of two married persons the one whereof beeing smitten by the hand of god with the dead palsie the other must needes pray for the gift of continencie ans in this case a married partie may aske it and by god mercy obtaine it because now there remains vnto him or her no other remedie but it is not so with single persons considering that they haue an other remedie which is mariage and therefore they may not looke or hope to obtaine such a gift thirdly they say god hath giuen to all man sufficient aide and strength that if they will vse the meanes they may haue the gift of chastitie for sufficient grace is giuen to all though not effectuall ans it is false there is neither sufficient nor effectuall grace giuen to all to liue a single life but it is a rare and speciall gift giuen onely to some paul to timothie willeth younger woman not to indeauour to forbeare when they haue not the gift but in want thereof to marrie tim where he takes it for graunted that they had no such power giuen them of god to liue in perpetuall chastitie though they would iv the fourth reason popish vowes doe abolish that order which god hath set in the societie of mankinde to wit that man should not onely serue him in the duties of the first table out in the duties of the second by seruing of man gal by loue serue one another againe rom loue is called the fulfilling of the law because the law of god is practised not apart by it selfe but in and with the loue of our neighbour from this order it followeth that euery man beside the generall calling of a christian must haue some particular kinde of life in the which he must walke and therein doe seruice to man which if he refuse to doe he must not eate according to the apostles rule thess now these vowes make a separation betweene these two for they bring man into a generall calling but they vtterly frustrate and make void the particular and the duties of it so as a man keeping them cannot be seruiceable to man either in church or commonwealth besides by the vow of pouertie the apostles rule is disanulled tim which is that if a man be able to maintaine himselfe or haue any kinred able to doe it he should not be chargeable to the church and so there might be sufficient almes to them that are truly poore v the fift reason they bring in againe iudaisme for iewish religion by god appointment stood in bodily rites and outward ceremonies actions and gestures yes in outward things as garments meats drink and their rule was touch not tast not from all which we are wholly freed by christ vi sixtly these vowes are idolatrous and superstitious for they are made and obserued with an opinion of god worship of merit and of the state of perfection whereas nothing can be made god worship but that which himselfe commandeth and bodily exercises are vnprofitable as paul saith and therefore they can not be meritorious and further to dreame of a state of perfection beyond the law of god is to make the law it selfe imperfect whereas contrariwise the law of the lord is perfect righteous and pure psalm vii lastly these vowes are against the preseruation of nature for by them specially that of perpetuall chastitie man are brought to destroy euen their owne body and liues which they are bound to preserue and maintaine ephesian no man euer yet hated his owne flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it the apostle euen in his daies noted it as a fault in the voluntarie religion that was then taken vp by some that for the maintenance thereof they spared not their owne body coloss and like vnto that is the practise of popish votaries which tendeth to the ruine and ouerthrow of nature and life it selfe these be the reasons in the next place we are to consider the allegations that are commonly made in the fauour and defence of popish vowes and first it is obiected in the old testament vowes were a part of god worship therfore they are so to be holde in the new ans there is great difference betweene them for first they had their warrant out of god word these haue not so nay there be expresse testimonies of scripture against these vowes secondly in their vowes there was alwaies right reserued to superiours to reuerse them if they liked them not but in monasticall vowes all right is taken from superiours for children are permitted to vow and their promises must stand against parents consent and wiues according to popish doctrine may vow against the expresse consent of their husbands thirdly they were not perpetuall but ceased with the ceremoniall law but these are supposed to haue a perpetuall equitie that must continue till the ende of the world secondly they alleadge that which is written matth some haue made themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen ans the meaning of the text is not that some haue vowed single life but that there are some who beeing assured that they haue the gift of continencie vpon that gift doe endeauour to maintaine their present estate that so they may the better serue god and aduance his kingdome both in themselues and others thirdly they obiect tim where paul speakes of certaine young woman which haue damnation because they haue broken their first faith that is as they interpret it their vow of single life ans the words are not to be vnderstood of the faith of the vowe but either of that faith and promise which was made to god in their baptisme or the faith and promise of seruice and releefe to be performed to the poore and for the breach of either of these they may be said to incurre damnation fourthly they say christ himselfe was a begger and therefore why may not we also be beggers ans though christ was poore yet was he no begger for he kept a familie and had a treasure iudas was the steward of his familie and bare the bagge ioh againe there is mention made of pence ioh which in likelihood was in the bagg that iudas kept yes of the money which he had the disciples are saide to buie meate ioh and though it were graunted that christ was a begger yet it followes not that we should be so for his pouertie was expiatorie and part of his sufferings so saith the apostle he beeing rich for our sakes became poore that we through his pouertie might be made rich corinthian fiftly they alledge that the disciples forsooke all and liued in pouertie and their example is propounded for our imitation ans they forsooke all indeede yet how not for euer but for a time and that not by vowe but onely in affection and disposition of their hearts for after they had forsaken all we read that they came to their nets and boates againe ioh againe the apostle paul speakes of himselfe and the rest when he saith haue we not power to lead about a wife beeing a sister corinthian by which it is plaine that they put not away their wiues sixtly mat if thou wilt be perfite saith christ to the young man goe sell all that thou hast and giue to the poore and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen and come and followe me here saith the papist our sauiour prescribes perpetuall pouertie by expresse counsell ans the words are no counsell but a speciall commandement of triall directed to this youg man and the ende of it was to discouer vnto him his secret pride and hypocrisie in that he boasted that he had kept all the commandements when as indeed he knew not what they meant lastly they obiect the example of the recabites who according to the commandement of their father ion adab would drinke no wine nor dwell in houses nor build nor plant nor sowe ierem and the lord approoueth their practise ans they did obey their fathers command in these things as beeing things indifferent but not as parts of god worshippe in the doing where of they placed religion and they obeyed it carefully for this ende that they might inure themselues vnto hardshippe secondly this their obedience touching these things stood not by any vowe much lesse was it perpetuall for then they should haue obserued all the things which they vowed equally which they did not for they dispensed with their fathers voluntarie iniunction for dwelling in tents and as we read verse they came vp for feare of the chaldeans that were in the land and dwelt at ierusalem and so much touching popish vowes whereof to conclude this may be said that they are all but a meere will worship standing vpon no ground or warrant of god word and therefore of no force to bind the consciences of man but are to be holden as they are in truth wicked and abhominable of fasting the eight head of the outward worship of god is fasting by fasting i vnderstand the religious fast which is ioyned with the duties of religion and namely the exercises of praier and humiliation touching it there are three principall questions to be handled in their order ans it is a voluntary and extraordinary abstinence taken vp for a religious end what this end is we shall see afterward first i call it voluntarie because the time and particular manner of fasting is not imposed or determined but left free to our owne liberty againe i tearme it extraordinary to distinguish it from ordinary fasting which stands in the practise of temperance and sobrietie whereby the appetite is restrained in the vse of meates and drinkes that it doe not exceede moderation now this kinde of fast is to be vsed of all christians at all times whereas the extraordinarie is not dayly and ordinarily to be practised but vpon speciall occasions and at speciall times in as much as it is a more strait and severe abstinence then the other ans for the obseruation of it three things are required fasting is then to be vsed when a iust and weightie cause or occasion therof is offered there be two iust causes of a fast the first is when some iudgement of god hangs over our heads whether it be publicke as famine pestilence the sword destruction ampc or priuate the prophet ioel in the name of the lord calls the iewes to a strait and solemne fast and that vpon this iust occasion because the lord had sent a great dearth vpon the land ioel ampc hester and her company fasted when shee had heard newes of the intended destruction of the iewes ester the people of nineueh which were not iewes but forreiners in regard of the couenant when the prophet came and denounced destruction vnto them for their sinnes they gaue themselues generally to fasting and praier ion the second cause of fasting is when we are to sue amp seeke by prayer to god for some speciall blessing or for the supply of some great want thus when daniel desired to obtaine the deliuerance of the children of israel out of captiuitie in babylon he gaue himselfe to fasting daniel thus christ fasted and spent the whole night in prayer vnto god before he chose his twelue apostles luke and in like manner paul and silas when they were to found and plant churches vsed praier and fasting act because in these matters of so great importance they looked for special direction from god himselfe lastly anna that shee might be more feruent in praier fasted night and day in the temple luke the second point is the right manner of fasting which stands in three things the frist is abstinence from meate and drinke for therein consisteth the very nature of a fast and if that be wanting it is no fast at all thus ester commanding the iewes to fast for her biddes them neither eate nor drinke for three daies ester the second is an abstinence from all delights which may any way cheare and refresh nature in this sort daniel fasted three whole weekes of daies abstaining from all pleasant bread flesh wine and ointments daniel so when dauid fasted it is saide that he lay all the night vpon the earth that he neither washed nor annointed himselfe nor changed his apparell sam in the solemne fast of the iewes the bridegrome and bride must come out of their chambers ioe by these places it is manifest that in a true fast there is required not onely abstinence from meate and drinke but from all delights recreations amp other things that might refresh the nature of man by this the popish fasting is iustly reprooued wherein though man are inioyned to abstaine from flesh yet there is giuen libertie to vse other delicates the third thing in the manner of a fast is so farre forth to abstaine from meate and other delights as the bodie may be thereby afflicted ezra proclaimes a fast and he giues a reason thereof that himselfe and the people might afflict themselues ezra this afflicting of a mans selfe is expouded by paul corinthian where he saith i beate downe my bodie and bring it in subiection now though we must humble and afflict our body by fasting yet we ought not to weaken abolish or destroy nature or doe that whereby the strength of nature may be taken away for such afflicting is forbidden coloss and contrariwise we are commanded by christ to pray for daily bread that is such food as is fitte to sustaine our substances and therefore we may by such exercises ouerthrow the same yet for the better vnderstanding of the manner of fasting three questions are to be answered i question how long the fast must continue ans the beginning and ende of a fast is left vnto our libertie but it is so long to be kept as the principall actions of the fast that is humiliation and prayer doe continue and though the beginning and ende thereof be free to vs yet it is most meete amp conuenient that solemne fasts should beginne in the morning and last till the euening this was the vsuall custome of the church in the old testament ii question whether in the day of a solemne fast a man may eate any thing or no and if he may what and how often ans we may eate and that if neede require once or twise yet here we must take with vs two caueats first concerning the quantitie of our meate it must be lesse then ordinarie and onely that which is necessarie to proserue nature and no more for if it be otherwise we abolish our fast secondly concerning the qualitie of that we eate it must not be daintie and pleasant but the meanest food and such as hath least delightsomnes and delicacie in it thus daniel fasted for three weekes of daies from morning to euening in which time he ate but a small quantitie of meate and that which was none of the daintiest daniel these caueats obserued a man may lawfully take some sustenance euen in the time of a solemne fast for there is no kinde of meate but may then be eaten quantitie and qualitie beeing obserued in the old testament no cleane beast was forbidden to be eaten in the day of a fast and in the new to the pure saith paul tit all things are pure and the kingdome of god stands not in meates and drinkes but in righteousnesse peace and ioy in the holy ghost rom iii quest whether all persons are bound to keepe the forme prescribed in the day of the solemne fast ans all that are able and can abstaine are bound yet because god worshippe stands not in eating or not eating some persons are here exempted first all those that are weake as children aged persons and those that are sickely secondly they that by reason of the constitution of their body doe find themselues vnfit to pray and heare the word cheerefully when their stomacks are emptie these persons may eate in the day of a solemne fast so that they obserue the caueats before remembred it is not with vs in these country as it was with the jew they could fast one two or three daies together without any inconvenience we cannot doe the like and the reason is plaine man that liue in those hotte country haue colde stomackes and so may fast the longer but in colder climates such as ours is in respect of theirs man beeing of hotter stomackes are not able to continue fasting so long as they the third point is concerning the right endes of a religious fast and they are foure the first is to subdue the flesh that is to bring the body and so the bodily lusts into subiection to the will and word of god by eating and drink the body is made heauie the heart oppressed the senses dull and the whole man vnfit for the duties of humiliation praier and hearing of the word luke that therfore this vnfitnesse may be taken away not onely the body it selfe but the vnruely lusts of the flesh are to be mortified and subdued by this exercise of fasting the second end is to stirre vp our deuotion and to confirme the attention of our mindes in hearing and in praier to this purpose in the scripture fasting and prayer are for the most part if not alwaies ioyned togither because when the stomacke is full the body and minde are lesse able to doe any good dutie and contrariwise when abstinence is vsed the heart is lighter the affections in better order the whole man more quicke and liuely in the seruice of god for this very cause anna is saide to worshippe god night and day with fasting and praier luke and the intent of the holy ghost there is to commend her for the feruencie of her praier which shee testified in that by such exercises shee stirred vp and increased the attention of her minde the third ende is to testifie the humilitie and contrition of our hearts that is to say our inward sorrow and griefe for sinne and our repentance and effectuall turning vnto god without this ende the fast is but a vaine ceremonie and therefore the prophet ioel calls vpon the people to turne vnto the lord with all their hearts with fasting weeping and mourning to rent their hearts and not their garments ampc ioel the prophet esay in like manner reprooveth the iewes because when they fasted they would afflict their soules for a day and how downe their heads as a bu rush and lie downe in sackcloath and ashes but made no conscience to turne from their euill waies esay therefore their outward humiliation was but hypocrisie the fourth end of a fast is to admonish vs of our guiltines before the lord and to put vs in mind of the acknowledgement of our sinnes wherby we become vnworthy of any blessing gift or mercie yes vnworthy to goe vpon the ground to breath in the aire to eate drinke sleepe or inioy any other benefit in a word that we haue deserued by our sinnes all the plagues and punishments threatued in the law against sinners the malefactor in the day of assises cannot giue greater testimonie of the true confession of his guiltines then by comming before the iudge with the rope about his neck neither can we bring a more notable signe of our true humiliation before god then by comming before him in the day of the solemne fast with open confession and proclamation of our guiltinesse both of sinne and punishment hence it was that in the fast of nineueh not onely man but euen the beast were forbidden to feede or drinke water for this very end that the niuevites might acknowledge their sinnes to be so great and heinous in the sight of god that in regard therof not onely the reasonable creatures themselues but also the beast of the field for their sakes were vnworthy of life and nourishment ans they are wicked and therefore neither approoued of god nor to be obserued by man and that for three speciall causes first the patrons amp maintainers of them doe appoint set times of fasting which are necessarily to be kept vpon paine of mortall sinne and abstinence from flesh with them is made a matter of conscience now to prescribe set times necessarily to be obserued is contrarie to that libertie which the church of god and the gouernours thereof haue for this purpose onely vpon speciall occasion when the question was mooued to our saviour by iohns disciples why they and the pharises fasted often whereas his fasted not answer was giuen in this manner can the children of the marriage chamber mourne as long as the bridegrome is with them but the daies will come when the bridegrome shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast mat from whence we may gather that times of fasting must be according to the times of mourning for christ giues them to vnderstand that they were to fast as occasions of mourning were offered as therefore there can be appointed no set time for mourning no more can there be enioyned a set time for fasting but must be left to the libertie of the church to be prescribed as god shall giue occasion againe the apostle reprooueth the church of galatia for obseruing set daies and moneths amp times and yeares in way of religion gal montanus the hereticke is thought in ecclesiasticall stories to haue beene the first that made lawes for set fasting and the churches of god in ancienter times fasted of their own accords freely not inforced by law or commandement but as time and occasion serued it is alleadged that this doctrine seemes to chalenge the church of england of heresie for it appointeth and obserueth set times of fast ans nothing lesse for our church inioyneth and approoueth these times not vpo necessity or for religions sake but for ciuill and politicke respects whereas the roman church holds it a mortal sinne to put off a set fast appointed so much as till the next day following the second reason they of the church of rome make a distinction of meates for they wholly forbid flesh to be eaten vpon daies of fast and allow whit meates onely then to be vsed and that of necessitie now this difference of meates is partly impious partly absurd and foolish impious it is because they make it for religions sake for since the coming of christ there is a libertie giuen to all man whatsoeuer to eate of all kindes of meates without any distinction commanding abstinence fro nothing which god hath created to be receiued with thanksgiuing it is true indeede we hold a difference betweene meate and meate but how not in way of religion but in regard of temperance amp health for ciuill and politike vses and respects as for the other we rest vpon the word of god amp hold it with paul a doctrine of deuills to command forbearance of meates in regard of conscience tim but to this place of paul they giue answer and say that it is spoken of heretikes such as the manichees amp novatias ampc were that held meats in their own nature vnclean we on the other side reply and say that this text condemnes those that make meates any way vncleane and that the papists doe put this difference in way of religion and conscience as appeareth by their strait prohibitions of flesh as vncleane and that for conscience sake and this text they shall neuer be able to shift off for it plainely condemneth any such distinction seeing to the pure all things are pure and euery creature of god is good and nothing to be refused so it be receiued with thanksgiuing tim furthermore this difference of meates is also foolish for first the light of nature and common sense teacheth that in such meates as they permit there is as much delicacie pleasure and contentment yes as much if not more strength for example in some fish fruits and wines as is in flesh by them forbidden yes s paul ascribes flesh vnto fish corinthian there is one flesh of man an other of beast an other of fish ampc secondly i call it foolish because in their set fasts they forbid flesh but permit diverse wines and the daintiest iuncates that the apothecaries shoppe can affoarde whereas in a solemne fast all meates drink and all other delights of what kinde and nature soeuer are to be forborne for this was the practise of the church in former times to forbeare not onely ordinarie foode but soft apparell sweete oyntments and whatsoeuer it was that serued to refresh and cheare the heart as hath beene shewed the third reason the church of rome giueth to their fastings false and erroneous endes as namely to merit something at the hands of god thereby to satisfie his iustice for sinne and to be true and proper parts of his worship and that these are false and erronious i prooue by these reasons first they do wholly frustrate the death of christ which is the onely thing in the world appointed by god to be meritorious and satisfactorie secondly fasting of it selfe is a thing indifferent neither good nor euill for though it be referred to a religious end which is the humbling of the soule yet it is not good in it selfe but onely in regard of the end neither is it any part of god worshippe beeing so referred but only a proppe and furtherance seruing in the right vse thereof to make a man more fit for the duties of god seruice thirdly these ends if they be well considered cannot be the true ends of fasting as will appeare by this example a begger at our doores entreats an almes we giue it and he receiues it but will any man say that by begging he doth merit or deserue his almes in like manner we are all beggers that haue nothing of our owne neither food nor raiment nor any other blessing we doe inioy but all we haue commeth vnto vs onely from god well vpon iust occasion we giue our selues to fasting we pray earnestly vnto him for mercie in the pardon of our sinnes in this case is it not great madnesse to thinke that we by begging mercie can merit mercie at the hands of god but praier saith the papist as it is praier merits nothing but as it is a good worke ans praier as it is a good worke is no other then begging and then it is vnpossible that it should be meritorious vnlesse it be granted that begging is meritorious which cannot be these reasons considered i conclude that popish fasts which stand in force among them at this day are wicked and damnable and consequently to be abolished if it were no more but for the blasphemous ends which they make of them and thus much touching this point of fasting as also concerning the other heades of god outward worship of the sabboth day the fourth maine question touching man as he stands in relation to god is concerning the time of god worship wherein certaine particular questions are to be resolued touching the sabboth day the first and most principall of all the rest is this in answering to this question i will not resolutely determine but onely propound that which i thinke is most probable first therfore i answer negatiuely that it is not in the churches libertie to alter the sabboth from the seuenth day the reasons are these i reason the substance of the fourth commandement is vnalterable now the sanctifying of a rest vpon the seventh day is the substance of the fourth comandement therfore the sanctifying of the rest of the seuenth day is vnalterable in regard of any creature that the truth of this reason may appeare two things are to be considered first what is changeable and temporarie in the sabboth and then what is morall and perpetuall the things which are temporarie and ceremoniall in the sabboth day are these i that rigorous and precise rest prescribed to the iewes which stoode in the strait obseruation of three things first the iewe might not on the saboth goe forth or take a iourney any whether for any matter or busines of his owne for of this there was a speciall commandement giuen exod tarry euery man in his place let no man goe out of his place the seuenth day namely to doe any worke or busines of his owne whatsoeuer secondly the iewe might not kindle a fire vpon the sabboth day for so saith the lord by moses ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations ampc exod it will be then said how did they for meate and fire in winter ans they prepared and dressed their meat the day before as they were commanded exod and for fires in winter if they had any vpon the sabboth it was necessarie as i suppose that as they drest their meate the day before so they should then beginne their fire also which beeing then begunne might be preserued on the sabboth thirdly the iewe might not carrie a burden this the lord did expressely forbidde them by the prophet ieremie thus saith the lord carrie no burdens vpon the sabboth day neither bring them in by the gates of ierusalem ampc ier and nehemiah charged the man of iudah with the prophanation of the sabboth in that kinde neh in these three particulars stood the strict obseruation of the iewish rest which is altogether temporarie and doth not concerne the times of the new testament because it was onely typicall the sabboth beeing in regard of that manner of rest a figure of the most strict spirituall rest from all sinne in thought word and deede required of cuery true beleeuer ii againe in the sabboth this was ceremoniall and temporarie that it was a speciall signe betweene god and his people of the blessings that were propounded amp promised in the couenant exod and these were principally two first it was a signe of their sanctification to teach them that as the lord had set apart a day of rest so he did and would sanctifie the obseruers thereof vnto himselfe by forgiuing their sinnes and receiuing them into his fauour in and by the messias to come secondly it was ordained by god to figure and signifie the euerlasting rest of god children in the kingdome of heauen of this the prophet esay speakes when he saith that from moneth to moneth and from sabboth to sabboth all flesh shall come to worship before god isaiah and the author to the hebrewes there remaineth therefore a sabbatisme or rest to the people of god heb iii furthermore this was temporarie in the sabboth that it was to be obserued vpon a set day namely the seauenth from the creation and that with set rites and ceremonies so saith moses the seauenth day is the sabboth deut againe on the sabboth day ye shall offer two lambes of a yeare old without spot and two tenth deales of fine flower for a meate offer mingled with oyle and the drinke offer thereof and the burnt offer of euery sabboth beside the continuall burnt offer and the drinke offer thereof numb iv this also was ceremoniall that it was to be obserued in remembrance of their deliuerance out of egypt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and the lord thy god brought thee out thence by a mightie hand and stretched out arme therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to obserue the sabboth day deut now as there were some things temporarie and ceremoniall in the sabboth so there are some things in it perpetuall amp morall and those i take it are three especially first that there should be a day of rest in which man and beast might be refreshed after labour secondly that this day should be sanctified that is set apart to the worship of god these two first are therefore morall because they are expressely mentioned in the commandement touching the sabboth thirdly that a seauenth day should be sanctified to an holy rest and that this holy rest should be obserued in a seauenth day i say not in this or that seauenth day but in one of the seauen now that this also is morall it appeares by these reasons first the sabboth of the seauenth day was instituted and appointed by god in paradise before the fall of man and the reuealing of christ yes euen then when there was one condition of all man this is plainly set downe in gen as also in the fourth commandement and vpon this ground it is manifest that a sabboth of a seauenth day cannot be a ceremonie simply considering the ordination thereof was in time long before all ceremonies if it be obiected that it was made a ceremonie afterward i answer that the reason is naught for matrimonie was ordained in paradise and afterward made ceremoniall to signifie the spirituall vnion betweene christ and his church and yet matrimonie is perpetuall and so is a sabboth of a seauenth day if it be againe alleadged that god did then keepe a seuenth day in his owne person and afterward inioyned it to man by his commandement i answer that the institution of the sabboth in paradise consisted of two parts blessing and sanctification and the meaning of the holy ghost is that god did both blesse it in regard of himselfe because he kept it in his owne person and hallowed it also in regard of man by commanding it to be sanctified and kept in performance of holy duties secondly the reasons of the fourth commandement are generall and the equitie of them is perpetuall and they haue this ende to vrge the rest of a seauenth day let them be considered in particular the first in these wordes sixe daies shalt thou labour which some take to be a permission as if god should haue said thus if i permit thee sixe thou shalt allow me a seauenth but they may be also taken for a commandement inioyning labour in the sixe daies first because they are propounded in comanding termes secondly because they are an exposition of the curse laid vpon adam thou shalt eate thy bread in the sweat of thy face namely in the sixe daies and thirdly because idlenes the spoile of mankind is there forbidden this beeing so there must needes be a seauenth day not onely of rest to ease them that labour in the sixe daies but also of an holy rest that god might be worshipped in it the second reason is taken from god example for in sixe daies the lord made heauen and earth ampc that which the lord himselfe hath done in person the same must man doe by his commandement but the lord himselfe in sixe daies laboured and rested the seauenth therefore man must doe the same this reason made by god to the creature must stand in force till he reuerse it which yet he hath not done nor doth if then these reasons doe not onely inforce a rest and an holy rest but a rest on the seauenth day then this lest on the seauenth day is a part of the fourth commandement and consequently the church can not alter it from the sabboth day because they can not alter the substance of that commandement which is eternall ii reason the sabboth day in the new testament in all likelihood is tied to that which we call the lord day and that as i take it by christ himselfe the reasons thereof are these i the sabboth day of the new testament is called the lord daie apocrypha now i suppose for in these points still wee must goe by likelyhoods its called the lord day as the last supper of christ is called the lord supper for two causes first as god rested the seauenth day after the creation so christ hauing ended the worke of the new creation rested on this day from his worke of redemption secondly as christ did substitute the last supper in roome of the passeouer so he substituted the first day of the weeke in roome of the iewes sabboth to be a day set apart to his owne worship ii the church of corinthian everie first day of the weeke made a collection for the poore as we may read corinthian and this collection for the poore in the primitiue church followed the preaching of the word praier and the sacraments as a fruite therof act for these be sabboth exercises that went alwaies together in the apostolicall church but it will be saide that collecting for the saints is a matter of indifferencie and may be done vpon any day as well as vpon the sabboth to this i answer that paul comands the corinths to doe it as he had ordained it in the church of galatia whereby he makes it to be an apostolicall and therefore a diuine ordinance yes that very text doth in some part manifest thus much that it is an ordinance and institution of christ that the first day of the weeke should be the lord daie for paul commaundeth nothing but what he had from christ iii christ and his apostles kept the first day of the weeke as the sabboth for christ rose againe the first day of the weeke and appeared to his disciples ioh and eight daies after he appeared againe to thomas ver which was the next first day of the weeke and this hath beene the opinion of sundrie ancient diuines cyrill lib in iohan cap cyrill vpon john saies that this eight day was without doubt the lordes daie and so ought to be kept because it is likely christ himselfe kept it holy and the same is affirmed and taught by ad casulanum epistle ad ianuarium epistle c augustine and sermon de res rect chrysostom again the apostles also kept it for when the holy ghost descended vpon them they were againe assembled vpon this day act v which i prooue thus the day of pentecost was the first day of the weeke for the iewes were commanded to bring a sheafe of their first fruits the morrow after the sabboth in the passeouer levit ampc and between that and pentecost they were to reckon fiftie daies hence it followeth that the day of christs resurrection falling the morrow after the iewes sabboth which is the first daie of the weeke pentecost must needes fall on that day and therefore the apostles met that same day and not they onely but also the whole church gathered themselues together and celebrated this day with preaching of the word and administration of the sacraments act and according to this institution of christ and the examples of his apostles hath beene the constant practise of the church from their times vntill now iv that which was prefigured in that it was prefigured was prescribed but the lord day was prefigured in the eight day wherein the children of the iewes were circumcised therefore it was prescribed to be kept the eight day thus the ancient fathers by name cyprian and augustine haue reasoned and taught againe the day of christs resurrection was prefigured by that day wherein the stone which the builders refused was made the head of the corner psalm v and in that it was prefigured it was appointed by god for then it appeared to be true which peter saith of christ that god had made him both lord and christ act and the same may be said of the sabboth of the new testament that it was in the figure preordained and therefore limited and determined by our sauiour christ vnto the lord day other reasons might be added but they are onely coniectures these be the principall iii reason god is lord of times and seasons and therefore in all equitie the altering and disposing therof is in his hands and belongs to him alone act times amp seasons the father hath kept in his owne hand againe christ is called the lord of the sabboth and autiochus epiphanes is condemned by the holy ghost because he tooke vpon him to alter times daniel besides that daniel saith that it is god alone that changeth times and seasons daniel now if it be proper vnto god as to create so to determine and dispose of times then he hath not left the same to the power of any creature and therfore as the knowledge thereof so the appointment and alteration of the same either in generall or particular belongs not to the church but is reserued to him the church then neither may nor can alter the sabboth day and this is the first part of the answer the second is this if the church had libertie to alter the sabboth then this alteration must be made within the compasse of the weeke to the sixt or fift or fourth or second or third or first daie and not to the eight or ninth or tenth daies without the compasse of the weeke the reason is plaine the church of the new testament hath more knowledge and more grace then the people of the old testament had and in that regard ought to haue more zeale and greater alacritie in the worship of god then they had that it may exceede the iewes according to the measure of grace receiued and thus the first and principall question touching the sabboth is answered and resolued now before i come to the next let vs in the meane while see and examine the reasons that are brought against the answer presently made first therefore it is alleadged that in the new testament there is no difference of daies for if we haue or make difference of daies we are in truth no better then iewes that there is no distinction of daies they prooue out of two places the first is column where the apostle saies let no man condemne you in respect of an holy day or of the new moone or of the sabboth day the second gal where the same apostle reprooues the galatians for obseruing daies and moneths and times and yeares to this i answere that both the places speake of the feasts of the iewes and of difference of daies that stands in force by the iewish ceremoniall law paul to the colossians warnes them to giue no occasision to others whereby they might iustly condemne them for obseruing of daies in superstitious manner vpon opinion of holines and necessitie as if mens consciences were bound to such obseruation and he reprooues the galatians for obseruing daies as it is likely they did not onely in the iewish but also in the heathenish manner to which purpose paul saith v he is afraid of them his meaning was because they placing their saluation in part in their iewish obseruation of daies after they had beene informed touching their libertie in christ did thereby mixe the gospel with the law and therefore he feared least by that meanes christ should become vnto them vnprofitable and so his preaching to small or no purpose againe they alleadge rom where paul saith one man esteemes one day better then an other and an other man counteth euery day alike in which words the apostle blameth not them which thinke all daies as one ans in the new testament all daies be as one in regard of the aptnes thereof to the worship of god and yet there may be a difference of daies in regard of order and this paul no where condemneth that we may the better conceiue this distinction we must consider a difference betweene the iewes sabboth and ours which is this that the iewes sabboth was both the time of the worship of god and also a part of his worship but the sabboth of the new testament though it be a necessarie time of god worship yet it is not a part thereof if it be said that it is commanded therfore must needs be a part of god worship i answer it is commanded not as god worship for substance but in respect of the duties of the worship that are to be kept and performed in it and hence it is manifest that in regard of god worship there is no difference of daies in the new testament but in regard of order thirdly they obiect that paul kept the iewes sabboth as well as the lord day for he and barnabas came to antioch and went into the synagogue on the sabboth day act and againe he and timothie conuerted lydia vpon the same day act ans the apostle did this vpon very good ground not because he held the obseruation of it as necessarie as the other but in regard of the weaknes of the gentiles and iewes newly called for the church that consisted of such persons in those daies was not yet fully perswaded and resolued of the abrogation of th e wish sabboth and therfore for the time he yeelded to their weaknes and obserued it as well as the other but afterward when they were confirmed in that point he forbare that libertie amp taught the full abolishment both of it and other ceremonies fourthly act paul is said to come to corinthian to aquila and priscilla and to worke with them in their trade of tent making and further it is said that he disputed in the synagogue euery sabboth day that is on the iewes sabboths and exherted the iewes and grecians hence it is gathered by some that paul did onely keepe the sabboth of the iewes and that both on the lord day and on the weeke daies he wrought with aquila and priscilla ans first we must remember this rule that charitie and necessitie doe dispense with the sabboth and with ceremonies if a towne should be on fire or if a citie or countrey should be presently assaulted by the enemie in the time of the word preached on the sabboth day the preaching of the word in these cases must cease for a time till by conuenient helpe the fire be quenched and the enemie be taken or driuen backe now whereas paul in the ordinarie daies of the weeke made tents and on the seauenth too not obseruing it but the iewes sabboth we must know that he did it vpon necessitie for the saluation of the iewes for priscilla and aquila were iewes vnconuerted and christ was not yet reuealed vnto them and if paul had but once named christ he could haue done no good among them yet afterward when he saw better opportunitie at the comming of silas and timotheus from macedonia then he could no longer containe himselfe but burned in the spirit and testified to the iewes that iesus was the christ verse now if there was cause why he did not speake of christ for the time then was there cause also why he did not make profession of a sabboth secondly i answer though paul did not then openly sanctifie the sabboth yet it is to be supposed that he kept it priuately by himselfe reseruing some speciall time for that purpose and the contrarie cannot be shewed the second question touching the sabboth ans in obseruing a sabboth of the new testament there are two things required a rest and a sanctification of the same rest to an holy vse this answer is made out of the very substance of the fourth commandement which is morall and hath nothing ceremoniall in it and the fourth commandement for substance consists in a ceasing fro labour and a holy dedication of our rest to holy vse that is to the worship and seruice of god now touching the first point the rest of the sabboth there are three seuerall opinions whereof two are contrarie and the third is a meane betweene both the first opinion is that we are bound as strictly to keepe the outward rest of the lord day as the iewes were to keepe the sabboth and sundrie man are of this minde but i take it this opinion is not warrantable for as we said before the iewish manner of keeping the sabboth in straitnes is a ceremonie and if we be bound to keepe it as straitly as the iewes did then iudaisme must still remaine and the ceremoniall law at least in some part must still be in force but in fauour of this opinion it is alleadged first that the fourth commandement is a law giuen as well to christias as to iewes and therefore it binds both alike ans the fourth commandement bindeth christians to keepe a seauenth day for the sabboth both in respect of rest as also in regard of sanctification thereof but that it bindeth them to the same strait manner of keeping the rest as it did the iewes we vtterly denie secondly that the reasons vsed to inforc the commandement doe equally binde all therefore the commandement it selfe ans it is true for the dutie commanded but not for the manner of performance againe the reason alleadged doth not follow for sometimes the holy ghost vseth a reason that is perpetuall to inforce a ceremonie that levi should haue no part nor inheritance amog his brother was a ceremonie commanded by god and yet the lord inforceth it with a reason that was perpetuall namely because himselfe was the part and inheritance of levi among the children of israel numb thirdly that the sabboth is a signe to beleeuers in the new testament that god is their god and they his people and the same it was to the iewes therefore the bond is as strict to the one as to the other ans beleeuers vnder the gospel haue two onely signes of the couenant baptisme and the lord supper and no more the scripture restraineth the sabboth as a signe onely to the iewes it is a signe betweene me and you in your generations exod againe v the children of israel shall keepe the sabbothfor an euerlasting couenant the sabboth was not a signe in the first institution in paradise for the couenant of grace was made after the fall of man and the signe thereof must needes be appointed after it considering that before the fall ceremonies signifying sanctification had no place and this is the first opinion the second opinion touching the rest of the sabboth is flat contrarie to the former namely that on the sabboth day after the publike worship of god is ended and the congregation dissolued man haue libertie either to giue themselues to labour or to honest pleasures and recreations this opinion doth quite abolish one of the commandements of the decalogue for it presupposeth all daies to be alike this onely prouided that the publike worship of god be solemnly kept now this may be done in any day of the weeke and there will be no neede of appointing a set time for god seruice if all daies be equall without any difference or distinctio but the fourth comandement for substance is eternall and requireth vpon paine of the curse both rest from labour and a setting apart of the same rest to the duties of holines amp religion and if it command abstinence from ordinarie abour then much more from pleasures and recreations the third and last opinion holdes the meane betweene the two former extremities and that i take to be the best and safest the substance hereof consists of these two conclusions that vpon the sabboth day of the new testament man are to rest from the ordinarie labours of their callings thus much is commanded in the fourth commandemet for the rest it selfe was not a ceremonie as i said before but the straight amp precise manner of resting againe it is most necessarie that religion and the power thereof should be maintained amongst god people which cannot possibly be vnlesse man at sometimes set themselues apart vnto it the student that desires learning doth not attaine vnto knowledge vnlesse he doe daily consecrate and devote himselfe to the studie therof in like maner religion cannot be preserved and maintained in the church except man doe whollie and continually employ themselues in the practise of the same furthermore it is the libertie that god lawe giues to servant yes and to beast that they shall not be oppressed with labour by working on the lord day amp this liberty is grouded vpon the law of nature amp comon equity here the common sort are wont to reply and say if we must rest from the labour of our callings the whole day we shall not be able to maintaine our selues and our families to which it may be answered that they which gathered manna onely in the sixe daies had as much as they that gathered it on the seuenth day amp that which they gathered the seuenth day did not remaine sweete but stanke and perished they therefore which rest on the sabboth daie must not be distracted with needelesse cares but liue by by faith and depend vpon god providence for meate drinke and clothing and the labour of the calling then vsed when it is expressely forbidden by god bringeth rather a curse with it then a blessing againe such persons must remember that godlinesse hath the promises of this life and the life to come tim and if they will first seeke the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse all things necessarie shall be cast vnto them in way of aduantage mat therefore if they keepe his commandement and rest vpon the seuenth day god will in mercy giue a blessing and they shall no lesse receiue from him their daily bread in that day then in any other ii conclusion in this rest sundry kindes of workes may be done and that with good conscience principally two the first are workes both holy and of present necessitie and they are such as cannot be done before or after the sabboth these are likewise of two sorts the first are those that doe necessarily pertaine to god worshippe so as without them god cannot be worshipped of this kind is the sabboth daies iourney act allowed among the iewes to the people to goe and heare the word preached thus we read that the shunamite went ordinarily vpon the sabboth and new moone to the prophet to heare him for when shee demanded leaue of her husband to goe to the prophet he askes her why wilt thou goe seeing it is neither newe moone nor sabboth day king of the same sort were the killing and dressing of sacrificed beastes in the time of the law wherof our sauiour saith haue ye not read in the law how that on the sabboth daies the priests in the temple break the sabboth and are blamelesse mat the next sort of workes of present necessitie are those that belong immediately to the preseruation of the temporall life of man and beast or that serue to the good estate of them both such are workes of mercie as the watering of cattell mark the drawing of a beast out of a pitte luke and such like the second kind of workes that may be done vpon the sabboth are workes of christian libertie out of the case of necessitie these were such as the iewes might not doe and yet we in the new testament may doe them for example prouision and dressing of meate making fires and carrying of burdens yet vpon this libertie man ought not to gather that they may doe what they will because they must cease from the ordinarie execution of the works of their callings for the word of god giueth no such warrant man are in this case to submit themselues to his will expressely reuealed and to vse their libertie according to the same here two cases are propounded i case whether we may not lawfully vse recreations on the sabboth day as shooting bowling hunting hawking wrastling ampc ans i take it we are not denied to reioice and solace our selues vpon this day for to some man at some times recreation may be more necessarie then meat in case of weakenes for present preseruation of health and though not in that regard yet beeing well sed it may be a furtherance to man in the performance of the duties of godlines as well as in the duties of their calling but this reioycing must be such as was the reioycing of the iewes nehem which was onely spirituall and in the lord for they reioyced onely for this that they vnderstood the law of god that was taught them but as for the recreations and pastimes aforenamed as bowling and such like they are not at this time to be vsed my reason is this that which is the more principall and necessarie namely labour in the execution of a mans calling is forbidden recreation therefore which is for labour must cease on that day when labour ceaseth againe if the duties of the ordinary vocation otherwise lawful and commendable be therefore forbidden because they destroy the rest commanded and take vp the mind that it cannot be freely emploied in the affaires of god then much more are workes of pleasures forbidden because they doe the same things much more though otherwise in themselues they be not unlawful obiect servant must haue recreation otherwise how shall they be able to worke in the weeke day ans true but their recreation must be granted them in the daies of labour for recreation pertaineth not to rest but to labour and is therefore vsed that a man by it may be made more fitte to labour ii case whether man vpon any occasion may not doe a worke of their callings in the morning or euening of the sabboth day as tradesemen for example i answer that they may so be it they obserue foure caveats i that the worke done be no scandall to any person ii that it withdraw not the mind of the worker or any other from sanctifying the sabboth either publickely or priuately iii that it be not a worke of gaine but a worke of mercie or tend to a worke of mercie iv that it serue for the immediate preseruation of life health or goods of life thus elijah continued his flight from iezabel many sabboths together king and the reason is good the sabboth was made for man saith christ that is not for the hurt but for the good of man of health and thus our sauiour christ visited the sicke ioh and cured the blind man vpon the sabboth ioh by whose example the phisitian amp the chirurgion may lawfully goe not onely to giue necessarie counsell but to minister necessarie phisicke and doe cures lastly of goods which are in present danger of loosing thus christ would haue the oxe presently pulled out of the pit luke and the shippe on the shore full fraught with wares requires present helpe if it be in apparent danger of sinking thus much concerning the first thing required in the observation of the sabboth the second thing required in the halowing of the sabboth of the new testament is the sanctification of rest which is nothing els but the dedicating of it to a religious vse that is to the practise of diuine worshippe this sanctification is either publicke or priuate the publike is the solemne performance of spirituall workes commanded in the second and third commandements and tending to publike worship and this may be reduced to foure principall heads i the reading or preaching of the word when the minister publikely in the congregation assembled doth faithfully deliuer vnto the people pure and sound doctrine and applies the same as necessitie requireth and occasion serueth to the edification and saluation of all and euery hearer in publicke audience and the people on the otherside do reuerently and attentiuely heare the same word read and preached ii the administration of the sacraments according to god institutio by the ministers of the church lawfully called iii publike praier wherein the minister calleth vpon the name of the lord amp the whole congregation in feruent affection lift vp their hearts vnto him and in mind giue assent to the praiers made in the name and behalfe of them iv collection and giuing of almes for the reliefe of the poore whether they be captiues and strangers or those that dwell among vs the sicke the needie orphanes and widowes and such like vpon these foure heads doth stand the whole publike worship of god for proofe and declaration hereof read these places neh act act act act corinthian ampc priuate sanctification which serueth to answer the second opinion stands in these things i that euery man in the beginning of the sabboth in the morning do priuatly prepare himselfe to the publicke seruice that followeth by priuate prayer by examination and humbling of himselfe before god in respect of his particular sinnes this the wiseman exhorteth vnto when he saith take heede to thy foote when thou entrest into the house of god ecclesiastes and his meaning is that before a man betakes himselfe to the publicke congregation there to perform seruice and worship vnto god he should looke into his heart and examine his affections and thoughts that he come not vnprepared which duty though it be alwaies to be done yet principally on the sabbothday the childre of israel rose vp early in the morning on the sabbothday to offer vp burnt offrings amp peace offerings to an idol exo much more ought wee ampc and it is said of our sauiour christ that he arose very early in the morning before day and went into a solitary place to pray and the day following was the sabboth when he preached in the synagogues mark ii that when the congregation is dissolued we spend the rest of the sabboth in meditation and conference of the word before preached and of the creatures thus it is said of some that heard paul preach that they receiued the word with all readines and searched the scripture whether those things were so act and the whole psalme was penned that it might be a song of the sabboth and it containes nothing but a meditation of the workes of god iii that man priuately exercise themselues in the workes of charitie and mercie as in visiting the sicke in making peace betweene those that are at discord in releeuing the poore in teaching and instructing the ignorant in coforting those that are distressed and comfortlesse neh then all the people went to eate and to drinke and to send par abroad to the poore and to make great ioy the tthird question touching the sabboth to this some doe answer in the euening and some in the morning my answer is this that the sabboth of the new testament amongst vs is to beginne in the morning and so to continue t l the next morrow amp not in the euening till the euening the reasons be these the sabboth is to beginne when other ordinarie daies begin according to the order and account of the church wherein wee liue it was the practise of christ and the apostles for christ as it hath beene thought of auncient times consecrated the sabboth in that he rose from the dead early in the morning when the first day of the weeke beganne to dawne matth and therfore it is fitte that the sabboth day should then beginne when he rose for as much as it is kept in remembrance of his resurrection the same was the practise of the apostles for act the first day of the weeke the iewes came togither at troas in the morning amp there paul preached from that time till midnight beeing the next morning to depart hauing staid there as is plaine out of the v seuen daies in that text i no e two things first that the night there mentioned was a part of the seuenth day of pauls abode at troas for if it were not so then he had staied at least a night longer and so more then seuen daies because he should haue staied part of another day secondly that this night was a part of the sabboth which they then kept for the apostle keepes it in manner of a sabboth in the exercises of pietie and diuine worshippe and namely in preaching yes further he continues there till the rest was fully ended he communed with them till the dawning of the day and so departed verse besides this text dauid saith in his psalme of the sabboth that he will declare god louing kindnes in the morning and his truth in the night psalm making the night following a part of the sabboth against this doctrine it is alleadged first that the sabboth is to begin in the euening because in the first of gen it is saide fixe seuerall times the euening and the morning made the first day and so the second and third ampc ans first in that text when it is said the euening and the morning made such amp such daies by the euening is vnderstood the night and by the morning the day and the euening was the end of the day and the morning the end of the night this exposition is auncient and yet in scripture we find not one place where the euening is put for the night secondly i answer that the collection from that place is of no force for thus the reason must needs be framed that which god did in appointing of daies the same must we doe in vsing of them but god in appointing of daies began the day at the euening ergo ampc the consequent is false for the case is otherwise in the constitution of time then it is in the vse of time constituted and there is not the same reason of things in doing as there is of the same things in beeing and vse thirdly this did not bind the iewes for they in all likelyhood began their sabboths in the morning indeede their solemne feasts as the passeover and such like beganne and were kept from euening to morning as we may read levit but their ordinarie sabboth was kept from morning to morning whence it is that saint matthew calls the dawning of the first day of the weeke the ende of the sabboth of the iewes matth and there is nothing i take it that can be brought to the contrarie it is obiected that moses saith leuit from euen to euen shall ye celebrate your sabboth ans the words must be vnderstood of the feast of reconciliation beeing the tenth day of the seuenth moneth which was solemnized and kept from euen to euen and it is called a sabboth because it was by speciall commandement appointed to be kept as the sabboth day and that in two respects first because it was to be kept holy by the iewes in humbling themselues and offer sacrifices verse secondly because vpon that day it was not lawful to doe any seruile worke vpon paine of death verse againe it is alleadged that ioseph of arimathea could not embaulme christ by reason that the sabboth was at hand and this was the euening i answer that the iewes sabboth there ment concurred with the day of their passeouer and hence it was that their sabboth beganne in the euening by this that hath beene said the answer to the third question is plaine to wit that in the new testament the sabboth is to begin at the morning and so to continue to the next morning and not as some suppose to begin at the euen and continue till the next euen and thus much touching the speciall questions of god worshippe as also generally concerning those that belong to man as he stands in relation to god of the nature and differences of vertue and the order of the questions thvs farre we are proceeded in the handling of two sorts of questions whereof some doe concerne man as he is considered apart by himselfe without respect vnto another some againe concerne man as he stands in the first relation namely to god now we come by order to speake of the third and last head of cases propounded by the conscience of man as he stands in the second relation to man and vnder this head are comprehended all those questions of conscience that are incident to the liues of man and which doe belong vnto man as he is a member of some societie whether it be the familie the church or the commonwealth for the better and more orderly proceeding in this discourse some conuenient subiect or matter is to be propounded whereunto all the questions that followe may fitly be reduced now of all other the most conuenient subiect in this kind is vertue and therefore according the differences of vertue we will distinguish the questions into three seuerall sorts but before we proceede to particulars it shall not be amisse to speake somewhat generally of vertue so farre forth as the knowledge thereof may giue light to the things that follow touching vertue two things are briefly to be remembred first what it is and then what be the distinct kindes thereof vertue is a gift of the spirit of god and a part of regeneration whereby a man is made apt to liue well i call it first a gift of the spirit of god because in whomesoeuer it is whether in christians or in heathen man it hath the nature of a gift that floweth immediately from the spirit of god and this i put in the first place to confute the receiued errour of the wisest heathen philosophers which call vertue an habite of the minde obtained and confirmed by custome vse and practise secondly i call it such a gift as is also a part of regeneration and this is added for two causes first that we may put a differece between christian and heathen vertues for howbeit the same vertues in kind and name are and may be found both in them that professe christ and those also that are ignorant of the true god yet they are in them after a diverse manner for in heathen man they are the gifts of god but not parts of regeneration and new birth but in those that be true christians they are indeede not onely the gifts of god spirit but also essentiall parts of regeneration that we may the better yet conceiue this difference we must vnderstand that the grace of god in man is two fold restraining and renewing restraining is that which bridleth and restraineth the corruption of mens hearts from breaking forth into outward actions for the common good that societies may be preserued and one man may liue orderly with another renewing grace is that which doth not onely restraine the corruption but also mortifieth sinne and renewes the heart daily more amp more the former of these is incidet to heathen man amp the vertues which they haue serue onely to represse the act of sinne in their outward actions but in christians they are graces of god not onely bridling and restraining the affections but renewing the heart and mortifyin all corruption and though those vertues of the heathen be graces of god yet they are but generall and common to all whereas the vertues of christians are speciall graces of the spirit sanctifying and renewing the minde will and affections for example chastitie in ioseph was a grace of god spirit renewing his heart but chastitie in xeuoerates was a common grace seruing onely to curbe and restraine the corruption of his heart and the like may be saide of the iustice of abraham a christian and of aristides a heathen secondly i adde this clause to meete with an errour of some learned philosophers who taught that the very nature of vertue stands in a meane or mediocritie of affections this that they say is true in part but not wholly for the mediocritie of which they speake without renouation of affections is nothing and therefore all vertues that are not ioyned with a renouation and change of the affections are no better then sinnes this point the philosophers neuer knew and hence it was that they stood onely vpon a mediocritie defining a man to be truly vertuous that did wisely obserue a meane betweene two extreames lastly i say that this gift of god makes a man fit to liue well in which clause standeth the proper effect of vertue which is to make those in whome it is to lead their liues well and by this we are aduertised to take heede of the opinion of philosophers concerning some particular vertues for in their morall discourses they giue both the name and the nature of vertue to those things which are either false amp counterfeit vertues or indeede none at all for example aristotle makes vrbanitie a vertue which is indeede a sinne beeing nothing els but a dexteritie in mocking and descanting vpon reens persons and names amp so it is reckoned by paul amongst grieuous sinnes and vices which are to be auoided ephesians againe the philosopher calls magna imitie whereby a man thinkes himselfe worthie of great honours amp thereupon enterpriseth great things a vertue which notwithstanding is to be holden a flat vice for by the law of god euery man is to range himselfe within the limits of his calling and not to dare once to goe out of it whereas on the contrarie the scope and end of this vertue as they tearme it is to make man to attempt high and great matters aboue their reach and so to goe beyond their callings besides it is directly opposite to the vertue of humilitie which teacheth that a man ought alwaies to be base vile amp lowly in his owne eyes the prophet dauid cleares himselfe of this sinne psalm when he saith lord i am not high minded mine eyes are not hautie i haue not walked in things that be great and aboue my reach furthermore no vertue must make vs to forsake good life but euery one serueth for this ende to make vs fit to liue a godly life the next point to be considered is what be the kindes of vertue vertue is either in the minde of man or in the will the vertue of the minde is prudence the vertue of the will is that that orders mans will and it is two fold for it respecteth either our selues or others that which respecteth our selues is conuersant about two maine things in the heart of man the reuenging and the lusting power that which respecteth the reuenging power is clemencie which standeth in the ordering and reforming of the raging power of anger the next which respecteth the lusting power is temperance vertues that doe respect others are either concerning curtesie as liberalitie or concerning equitie and these consist partly in doing of equitie as iustice partly in defending and maintaining it as fortitude now according to this distinction of vertues the questions of conscience are to be distinguished in this sort some of them concerne prudence some concerne clemencie some temperance some liberalitie some also concerne iustice and some fortitude of all which in order of questions concerning prudence there are two maine questions of conscience which cocerne prudence this i acknowledge is a high point in the life of man and such as cannot be resolued as it ought without great deliberation notwithstanding i will doe mine indeauour to answer something concerning prudence there are sundrie things to be considered first what is the beginning of the practise of this vertue and that in a word is the feare of god this feare standeth principally in two things the first is a reuerent awe of the maiestie of god in all places amp at all times whereby we are resolued that wheresoeuer we are we are in his presence and whatsoeuer we thinke speake or doe it is wholly and perfectly knowne vnto him the second is a resolued care to walk as in the presence of god that is to keepe his commandements and to yeeld obedience vnto his maiestie in all things now that this feare is the beginning of wisedome it appeares by sundry places of scripture psalm the beginning of wisedome is the feare of iehouah pro the beginning of knowledge is the feare of the lord fooles despise wisedome and vnderstanding moses telleth the children of israel that herein stood their wisedome and vnderstanding before the eies of all people that they obserue and practise all the ordinances and iudgements of god which he had commanded them deut and dauid professeth of himselfe that by his daily meditation in the law of god and keeping his commandements he became wiser then his enemy psalm yes of more vndestanding then all g teachers ver yes further more prudent then the ancient ver secondly we must consider the rule of prudence and that is spiritual vnderstanding whereby we are inabled to know and conceiue spiritually truth and falshood good amp badde this saint paul wished vnto the church of coloss when he saith we cease not to pray for you and desire that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge of his wil in al wisedome amp spirituall vnderstanding column and the same apostle exhorting the romanes to giue vp their body a liuing sacrifice holy amp acceptable vnto god and not to fashion themselues like vnto this world he makes the ground of his exhortation and consequently the rule of their obedience thereunto the renouation of their mindes or vnderstandings to this ende that they might prooue what is the good will of god acceptable and perfect and answerably doe and performe the same rom and his reason is good because though prudence be the rule of all vertues as the auncient philosophers among the heathen haue affirmed yet it selfe must be ruled by a higher rule which they knew not namely by spirituall vnderstanding and knowledge according to the word of god thirdly we are to consider what is the practise of prudence and wherein it consisteth in the practise thereof two actions are required the one is delil ration whereby according to spirituall vnderstanding we aduise what is good and bad what truth and falshood what is to be imbraced and done and what not the other is determination whereby we resolue vpon former deliberation to imbrace to doe to follow and pursue the best things in euery kind and therein stands the very nature and forme of true christian prudence when a man vpon due consideration of things and actions together with their properties and circumstances proceedes to a holy and godly resolution according to the rule aforesaid now the practize of prudence in these two actions is very large and consisteth of sundry branches i will onely touch the principall and propound them in these rules following the first rule is this a man must in the first place and aboue all things in the world carefully prouide for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes and the saluation of his soule this our sauiour christ commandeth as a speciall dutie matth verse seeke ye first the the kingdome of god and his righteousnes and sinners and vnrepentant persons are sundrie times in scripture termed fooles as in many other respects so principally in this because they faile in this first point of wisedome going on in their sinne without repentance the fiue virgin in the gospell are for this very cause pronounced foolish or fooles because they provided not for the oile of faith but did onely content themselues with shining lampes that is a naked profession of religion and vertue and for want of wisedome and prudence in this point they were iustly depriued of accesse into the bedde chamber thus the rich man that had great reuenewes and abundance of wordly wealth is notwithstanding termed by god himselfe a foole because he gathered riches to himselfe and was not rich in god that is he minded earthly things and placed his cheife felicitie in vaine and transitorie riches not once forecasting how to come into the fauour of god that he might be saued to this rule i adde that which paul by way of caueat commendeth to the ephesians ephesians take heede that ye walke circumspectly not as vnwise but as wise redeeming the time as if he should say play the part of wise man take time while time serues lay hold of the meanes of saluation vse no delaies in heauenly matters deferre not your repentance from day to day for the daies are euill and you may be surprized in your sinnes before you be aware ii rule we must vse continuall watchfulnes against our enemy but specially against our spirituall enemy this watchfulnes our sauiour commandeth often in the gospel but specially in mark take heede watch and pray watch therefore for ye know not ampc those things that i say vnto you i say vnto all man watch and s peter exhorteth in like manner be sober and watch for your aduersarie the deuill as a roaring lyon walketh about seeking whome he may deuoure pet v now this dutie stands principally in two things first that we diligently obserue the danger wherein we are by reason of temptations secondly that we daily labour to search and finde out the secret counsells practises and enterprise of our enemy and withall seeke to preuent them to this purpose we must watch against the corruptions of our hearts the temptations of the deuill and the day and houre of our death that we be not found vnprepared for our owne sinnes are many satan is strong and subtill in his suggestions and temptations amp death though of all other things it be most certaine and cannot be auoided yet it is most vncertaine in regard of the time when the place where and the manner and kind of what and how a man shall ende his daies iii rule euery man must measure himselfe by his owne strength and doe nothing beyond his abilitie this rule is set downe though expressed in other tearmes rom no man must presume to vnderstand aboue that which is meete to vnderstand but ought to be wise according to sobrietie as god hath dealt to euery man the measure of faith an example of the transgression of this rule we haue in dauids three worthies who brake into the host of the philistims to fetch dauid the king water from the well of bethlem sam which act of theirs was a rash enterprise and such a one as dauid himselfe condemneth in that chapter because they went beyond their strength to encounter with a whole garrison of man they beeing themselues but fewe namely three in number iv rule we must distinguish betweene the necessarie workes of our callings that pertaine to vs and other workes that are out of our callings and pertaine not vnto vs and we must doe the other though we leaue these vndone this rule is propounded in the medle with your owne businesse that is do the necessarie workes of your callings that belong to you though you leaue the other for the time vndone the contrary to it is to liue or to behaue himselfe inordinately thess and we haue an example of the transgression hereof in peter ioh whome when christ had commanded to follow him he would needes aske him what john should doe christs giues him this answer what is that to thee in which wordes he teacheth that not onely peter but also euery man must attend vpon the necessarie and proper workes of his owne vocation and not deale with other mens businesse which because peter did he is by that answer secretly repooued and iustly condemned of curiositie in that behalfe v rule we must put a difference betweene things honest and of good report and things vnhonest and of bad report and these we are to let passe and onely to doe the other philipp whatsoeuer things are true whatsoeuer things are honest whatsoeuer things are iust whatsoeuer things are pure whatsoeuer things pertaine to loue whatsoeuer things are of good report if ther be any vertue if there be any praise thinke on these things to this may be added one caveat that of two euils which are both sins we must not onely not chuse the les but we are to chuse neither for their damnation is iust who affirme that man may doe euill that good may come of it as the apostle saith rom vi rule things of profit and pleasure must giue place to things that belong to vertue and honestie this conclusion the light of nature teacheth worldly man say who will shew vs any good but dauids praier is lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs psalm godlines is the great gaine therefore all gaine must giue place to godlines tim vii rule we may not trust man vpon faire pretences that they make vnto vs without further triall this point was practised by our sauiour christ who though many beleeued in his name when they saw the miracles which he had done yet he did not commit himselfe vnto them because he knew them all ioh and it is also verified by the common proverbe first trie and then trust viii rule we must giue place to the sway of the times wherein we liue so farre forth as may stand with keeping faith and a good conscience we may not be temporizers and change our religion with the times but yet we may and must giue place to times as we giue place to the streame so that it be done with keeping of true religion and good conscience this rule was practised by paul act who liuing among the heathen was constramed to speake as they and therefore he saies that he departed in a shippe to rome whose badge was castor and pollux act againe he was three yeares in ephesus an idolatrous place where the great goddesse diana was worshipped yet in all that time he contained himselfe and spake nothing in particular against diana but onely in generall against false god saying that they be no god that are made with hands v nay alexander could not charge him with this that he had in all that while blasphemed their goddesse diana paul therefore was faine to yeeld to the sway of those times that so he might doe some good in ephesus by his ministerie whereas if he had spoken against diana directly it had not bin possible for him to haue done that good by preaching which otherwise he did againe in the primitiue church the apostles for the weaknes of the iewes did yeelde to the vse of circumcision and permitted abstinence from blood and that which was strangled ampc so farre forth as it stood with pure religion and good conscience and if they had not so done they should not haue wonne the iewes to the faith as they did ix rule if we cannot doe the good things that we desire in that exquisite manner that we would we must content our selues with the meane and in things which are good and to be done it is the safest course to satisfie our selues in doing the lesse least in ventring to doe the more which cannot be we grow to the extremitie and so faile or offend in our action it is a good and wise counsell of the preacher to this purpose eccl be not iust ouermuch and his meaning may be this be not too strict or curious in effecting that which thou intendest exactly when thou canst not but rest contented in this that thou hast done thine endeauour and take to the lesse when the greater cannot be effected in some country popish images erected in churches doe stand vndefaced the good desire of the people is that they may be pulled downe but this cannot be brought to passe what then are they to doe in this case they must not grow to extremitie and pull them down themselues but they must intreat the lawful magistrate for their remooueall and pray to god that he may be mooued so to doe and in the meane time rest content with that they haue done and waite the magistrates pleasure in the iudiciall law by reason of the hardnes of the iewes hearts sundrie sinnes could not vtterly be taken away as diuorcements polygamie vsurie hereupon the lord makes a law of toleration without approbation and did not remooue them quite away for that was not possible in regard of man for the time but restrained the euill that could not be quite off and abolished otherwise and herein appeared the great wisdome of god in making a law not to allow of nor yet vtterly to take away but to moderate the practise of these sinnes in the iewes for the hardnes of their hearts in like manner in this our land there is the practise of vsurie a sinne that cannot nor euer shall be rooted out vtterly for this cause the states of this kingdome haue out of their wisdome prouided a law for the toleration thereof after a sort and that vpon speciall cause for if the magistrate should haue enacted a law vtterly to abolish it it would before this in likelihood haue growne to great extremitie the same was the practise of the apostles in their times who yeelded to beare with the vse of circumcision for a time when they could not otherwise vtterly cut it off ans there be foure principall caueats which beeing obserued policie may be vsed and is not against christian religion i nothing must in policie be said done or intended to preiudice the truth specially the truth of the gospell ii nothing is to be said done or intended against the honour and glorie of god either in word in deede or in shew iii nothing must be wrought or contriued against iustice that is due to man iv all actions of policie must be such as pertain to our calling and be within the limits and bonds thereof for if any action whatsoeuer be done out of that calling wherein god hath placed vs or at least be not answerable thereunto though it be plotted and attempted in neuer so great wisedome and policie it is unlawful and not warrantable these caueats obserued it is not vnlawful to vse that which we commonly call policie and the reason is this when any busines is to be done we must make a twofold inquirie first into the thing to be done whether it be good or badde lawful or not lawful commanded or forbidden secondly into our selues whether the worke in hand be agreable to the calling of the doer or answerable to that dutie which he oweth to god and man now because both these are grounded vpon the former cautions therfore we conclude that whatsoeuer busines is taken in hand and not suted vnto them it hath not good warrant and so cannot be done with good conscience yet for better clearing of this answer let vs a little consider the scriptures and the examples there recorded touching this policie in iosh we shall finde that ioshua vseth martiall policie in the besieging of ai placing one part of his armie in an ambush and causing the other part to flie for by that meanes the man of ai comming out of the citie and pursuing those that fled the souldiors that lay in ambush tooke the citie and destroied it in sam dauid beeing to make war against the philistims asketh counsell of god and god teacheth him policie he therefore in his owne example allowes policie and more especially those wise and prudent shifts in war which we call stratag ms or policies of the field we haue also the example of paul for this purpose who act faines himselfe to haue made a vowe to be a nazarite that he might yeelde somewhat to the weakenes of the iewes who were not sufficiently informed in the doctrine of christian libertie this practise was warrantable neither was it a sinne in paul for he did it by the counsell of the church at ierusalem v and paul himselfe neuer made mention of this as of a sinne which he would vndoubtedly haue done had it beene sinne againe act when he was brought before ananias the priest and the councell at ierusalem beeing in some danger he vseth policie for he pretended that he was a pharisie and by that meanes raised a dissension between the pharisies and the sadduces and this was no sinne in paul for he spake no more but the truth onely he concealed part of the truth now if it fall out otherwise that policie be vsed and any of these foure caueats be not obserued then it looses both the name and nature of true policie and becomes fraud craft and deceit and so is condemnable example hereof we haue in dauid sam who when he came to the court of achish king of gath and saw himselfe in daunger he faines himselfe madde which though he did to saue his owne life yet his poli e was not to be allowed of for it tended to his owne disgrace he beeing king of israel and it was also dishonourable vnto god who had appointed him to be the king of israel againe that which is commonly called the policie of machiavel is here to be condemned for it is not answerable to the cauears before remembred besides that it is not onely against the written law of god but euen against the law of nature and the very foundation thereof standeth onely in the practise of lying swearing forswearing in fraud deceit and injustice of questions concerning clemencie clemencie or meekenes is a vertue that serues to moderate wrath and reuenge touching clemency there be three questions aus that a man may behaue himselfe so as becommeth a christian in these cases he must in the first place inquire into the nature and qualitie of the wrong done now offences that are done to vs by others are of three sorts the first sort and the least are when some things are done to vs that do onely displease vs but bring no losse or hurt to vs these be light offences and of this kind are common infirmities as hastinesse teastinesse frowardnesse slownesse and dulnesse of nature of this kind also are reproches of vnskilfulnesse ignorance basenes pouertie and such like the first degree then of clemency is not so much as to take notice of these sleight offences but to let them passe and burie them in obliuion salomon saith a mans vnderstanding deforreth his anger and it is his credit to passe by an offence pro his meaning is that when small offences are done which cannot be avoided then in discretion a man should with hold his anger and not take notice of them but passe by them and let them goe for this shall be a farre greater ornament vnto him then if vpon the deede done he should haue hastily proceeded to reuenge the second sort of offences are small iniuries such as doc not onely displease vs but with all bring some little hurt to vs either in our goods life or good name now the second degree of meekenes is to take notice of these but withall to forgiue them and put them vp the reason is because alwaies greater care must be had of peace and loue then of our owne priuate affaires read the practise hereof ioh it was obiected to christ wrongfully that he was a samaritane and had a deuill christ takes knowledge of the wrong and saith you haue reproched me but withall he puts it vp onely denying that which they said and clearing himselfe i haue not a deuill but i honour my father dauid had receiued great wrong at the hands of ioab and shimei as appeares in the historie of his life but principally when he came first to be king of israel a sam and yet he takes not a hastie course presently to be reuenged vpon his adversaries but proceedes in this order first he takes notice of the fact and commits his cause to god ver and then afterward as opportunity serued gaue the parties their iust desert the reason was because beeing newely invested in the kingdome his adversaries were strong and himselfe weake euen by his owne confession amp therfore not able at the first to redresse the iniury done vnto him but when he had once established himselfe then he doth not onely beginne sam but proceedes to full execution of punishment vpon them as we read king ver the third sort of wrongs are greater iniuries such as are not onely offensiue to our persons but withall doe preiudice our liues and bring a ruine vpon our estates both in goods and good name these are the highest degree of iniuties manifested in open and apparent wrongs and therefore answerable to them is required the third and highest degree of clemencie which stands in three things first in taking notice secondly in forgiuing them thirdly in a iust and lawful defending our selues against the wronging parties this is the summe and substance of the answer for the better conceiuing whereof sundry questions are further to be propounded and resolued first in generall it is demanded how a man should and ought to forgiue an iniurie ans in forgiuenes there be foure things the first is forgiuenes of reuenge that is of requiting euill for euill either by thought word or deede this must alwaies be practised for vengeance is not ours but the lord and great reason then that we should euermore forgiue in regard of reuenge and hatred this the apostle teacheth when he saith corinthian loue is not provoked it neuer thinketh much lesse speakes or does evill the second is forgiuenesse of priuate punishment which is when man returne punishment for iniuries done in way of requitall and this must alwaies take place with vs because as vengeance it selfe so also punishmet in way of revenge is god alone the third is forgiuenesse of iudgement when we iudge an inurie done to be an iniurie this iudgement we are not bound to forgiue vnto man for we may with good conscience iudge a sinne and a wrong to be as they are and yet notwithstanding if a man make satisfaction for the wrong done then there ought to be forgiuenes even in regard of iudgemen the fourth is forgiuenesse of satisfaction this we are not alway bound to remitte but we may with good conscience alway require satisfaction where hurt is done secondly for the further clearing of this generall question we are to answer some particular cases vsually propounded in the liues of man and namely fiue i case whether a man may with good conscience and a meeke spirit defend himselfe by law for wrongs that are done vnto him i answer affirmatively a man may with good conscience defend himselfe against great iniuries by the benefite of lawe for magistracie is god ordinance for the good of man rom and therefore man may vse the benefite of the authoritie iudgement and iurisdiction of magistrates without breach of conscience again it is the expresse lawe of god that when a false witnesse riseth vp against a man to accuse him of a trespasse that both the accuser and the accused should stand before god that is before his preists and iudges for the time beeing and haue remedie at their hands an example of which iudiciall defense we haue in paul who in case of wrong makes his appeale to the iudgement seate of rome act but it is alleadged out of scripture to the contrarie luke to him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke offer also the other mat if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coate let him carry thy cloake also ans these places are spoken of priuate persons that want the defense and assistance of the publicke magistrate and such must rather suffer wrong vpon wrong blow vpon blow and losse vpon losse then right their owne wrongs by reuenging themselues againe it is obiected that paul saies lawing is a fault corinthian there is vtterly a fault among you because ye goe to law one with an other ampc ans we must distinguish between things themselues and the manner of doing them when paul saies it is a fault he condemneth not lawing absolutely in it selfe but the corinthian manner of going to law which was this first they went to law with scandall before the tribunalls of heathenish and vnbeleeuing iudges and so made the gospell to be slandered and reproched secondly they went to law vpon light causes and for small iniuries which they might well haue put vp amp easily brooked thirdly in lawing they fell into rash and violent passions of rage and envy so as they could not temper themselues but must needes goe to law in the first place which should rather haue been the last and the desperatest remedie of all and this bad manner of suing one another at the law is it which paul rebukes as a fault and it is to be obserued that paul notes their fault by a word that signifies weakenesse or impotencie of their affections whereby it came to passe that being ouercome by the strength of their owne desires vpon iniuries offered they were vnable to beare them in any degree of christian moderation and there vpon hastily proceeded to the courts of heathen iudges for determination of controversies and contentions among them it is further alleadged that when a man is any way wronged it is god will it should be so and therefore he ought not to seeke redresse but to rest himselfe in the will of god ans it is god will we should haue diseases and yet it is no lesse his will that we should vse good means to be cured of them so is it in wrongs and iniuries done vnto vs as his will is we should be afflicted so also hath he willed our deliuerance by such meanes as himselfe hath appointed but our sauiour would haue his disciples to be as sheepe among wolues and therefore we ought to endure all wrongs without reuege for the sheepe takes all wrongs and doth not so much as defend it selfe against the woolfe ans so christ commandeth that we should be simple as doues matth and yet withall he commandeth vs to be wise as serpents to defend our owne heads and to saue our selues lastly it is alleadged corinthian that loue seekes not her owne therfore loue must not defend her selfe ans loue doth not so seeke her owne things as that shee neglecteth the good of others but seeking her owne shee seekes the good of all and this practise is not against but according to the law of charitie ii case how is a man to defend himselfe by law ans for the resoluing of this question we must take two rules the first is this we must first trie all meanes and vse all remedies that may be before we vse the remedie of law it is our sauiours direction matth agree with thine aduersarie quickely while thou article in the way that is before the controuersie be ended by order of law againe matth if thy brother trespasse against thee goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone and saint paul in this case prescribes a course to be taken before hand namely first to beare and suffer as much as may be corinthian why rather suffer ye not wrong why rather sustaine ye not harme then if bearing will not ende it to commit our cause to priuate arbitrement of one or two v is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that can iudge betweene his brother law is to be vsed in this case as the physitian vseth polson and that is onely in desperate cases the second rule is that our patient mind must be made knowne to all man philipp in taking the benefit of law we are to vse great moderation of mind and that in three respects before we goe to law in lawing and when the suit is ended the moderation of mind before the beginning of suits in law stands in three things first we must consider that all iniuries whatsoeuer they be doe befal vs by the prouidence of god and that for our sinnes vpon which consideration we ought to submit our selues to god will to obey him to arme our selues with patience and to lay aside all anger envy malice and impatience secondly we must consider before hand that courts of iustice are the ordinance of god in which it pleaseth him to testifie his presence iustice and goodnes and vpon this ground we shall be mooued to depart with our owne right and to yeeld our selues and all the right we haue into the hands of god in the vse of the meanes appointed in the meane time depending on him by faith for the issue and euent of our suit and hence by the way it appeares that few or none doe vse this ordinance of god as they ought because the greater sort of man that commence suits in law doe not consider either the nature or ende of ciuill courts no man ordinarily will yeeld a haire of his right but euery one sixeth his eyes wholly vpon the euent of his action by extremitie of law and so swarueth from that christian moderation required by the word of god in this case thirdly we must set down with our selues lawful and iust endes of our actions not vniust and unlawful these iust endes are first god glorie in the execution and manifestation of iustice secondly the honest defence of our owne right thirdly publike peace fourthly the amendment of disordered persons and not the defamation or hurt of any man the moderation of the mind in lawing stands in these particulars in seeking after peace to the vtmost rom if it be possible as much as in you is haue peace with all man in loue of our enemy with whom we are at controuersie in law in neither vsing nor shewing extremitie in our proceedings matth matth after that the suit is ended the moderation of our mindes must be expressed by our behauiour in regard of the euent of our action for if the law goe with vs we are to giue god thankes for the manifestation of his iustice in the course taken if on the otherside it goe against vs we may not rage or be discontentedly grieued but commend our cause quietly to god and accuse our selues for our owne sinnes and say with dauid righteous article thou o lord and iust are thy iudgements psalm iii case whether may a man defend himselfe by force when he is wronged ans in some cases he may lawfully defend himselfe by force reasons first because the gospel doth not abolish the law of nature nor the positiue lawes of all country but it doth establish them now it is the law of nature and nation that a man may defend his life and health in some cases vpon iust occasion secondly this is god law exod if a theefe be found breaking vp a house and be smitten that he die no blood shall be shed for him abraham was a stranger in the land of sodom and yet he reskued his brother lot and recouered all his substance that he had lost by force amp armes gen and his action was approoued of god for melchisedeck met him at his returne from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him yes and blessed god for his deliuerance v againe in some cases a man may giue his life for his brother so saies s john ioh we ought also to lay downe our liues for the brother iv case when may a man defend himselfe by force ans not alwaies and vpon euery occasion but onely in these cases first when violence offered is so sudden and vnexpected that when it comes there can be no escape either by yeelding or by flying or by some suffering secondly when the violence offered is open and manifest so as there is no other way to reskue our selues but by striking or killing thirdly when violence is offered and the magistrate absent either for a time and his stay be dangerous or altogether so as no helpe can be had of him nor any hope of his comming in this case god puts the sword into the priuate mans hands fourthly when the defense is iust and done in a right manner a iust defense stands in these things i it must be done incontinent and forthwith so soone as euer violence is offered for if there be delay and it come afterward it looses the name of a iust defense and becomes a reuenge arising of prepensed malice as the lawyer vse to speake ii there must be an intention not to reuenge principally or to kill but onely to defend himselfe iii there must be a iust and equall proportion of weapons therefore it is no iust defence to shoote a naked man through with a musket or other peece of ordinance when he offers violence v case whether a man may reskue himselfe or others by combate ans it hath beene of ancient times an vsuall manner of defence in some country that in case of difference betweene people and people in matters of weight two man should be chosen out among the rest who by fighting hand to hand and killing one an other should ende the controuersie but this way of defense how auncient so euer it be is vtterly unlawful reasons are these first it is the expresse commandement of god thou shalt not kill in which all priuate man are forbidden to kill or slay but in the case of iust and necessarie defense secondly we may not hazard our liues without some speciall warrant fro god if we doe it is a flat tempting of god and this is done in euery combate thirdly if magistrates will permit such fights as this is then they are bound to defend and saue the life of the innocent for by such permission oftentimes innocent blood is shedde and the more harmelesse partie goes by the worst but it will be and is obiected first that a combate is a triall of innocencie ans it is not so for he that is stronger vsually ouercomes in the combate not he that hath the more righteous cause againe there be other meanes to trie a truth besides this as by examination and by oath lastly triall by the combate is of the same nature with the triall of a murtherer by the bleeding of a corpes touched or handled which is very doubtfull and of all other most vncertaine secondly it is alleadged that if a man take not a chalenge he is disgraced for euer ans there is no warrant in god word for a priuate man to accept a chalenge nay it is rather flat against the word for god saies reuenge is mine the priuate man saies the contrarie the wrong is mine and i will be auenged of him that hath done it again it is better for any man to indure a little reproch with some man then to loose or hazard his life thirdly it is obiected that the philistims offered to trie the victorie by a single combate with the israelites and appointed goliah on their side to giue the chalenge and that dauid on the israelites side accepting the chalenge encountred with him and had good successe it may seeme therefore that combates are lawful for it is better that one man should perish in war then that a whole armie should miscarie ans that was a speciall and extraordinarie example of triall and dauid was a champion in that fight not by ordinarie appointment but by extraordinarie prophetical instinct of god spirit againe in war though there be lesse danger in hazarding one mans life then a whole armie yet a good amp iust cause is to be maintained with all the strength that may be made and not to depend vpon the power and courage of one man who in probability vnlesse he be supported by speciall calling and assistance from god may be ouercome and loose the victorie fourthly it is alleadged that an armie may fight against an army therfore one man against an other ans the reason is not alike for war and armies are god ordinances and so are not combates and it is not god will that man should deuise and establish new waies and meanes of triall not allowed by his word but rather rest content with that he hath appointed fiftly ionas did hazard his life by casting lots therfore a man may by combate answer to say that ionas did put his life in hazard by lottes is an vntruth for there was onely a coniecturall triall made who should be the cause of the present danger and when the lot fell vpon him he was not cast into the sea by the lotte but by his owne advise and counsell againe the casting of ionas into the sea did not befall him by lotte but by his owne voluntarie resignation of himselfe into the hands of god willingly vndergoing it as a iust punishment of the neglect of his calling which himselfe confessed in these words for i acknowledge that for my sake the great tempest is vpon you ion sixtly moses and the egyptian fought a combate and moses slew him ans moses took vpo him publike revenge in this action as a magistrate and not priuate as a priuate man for though as yet his calling was not fully manifested to his brethre yet the truth is god had called him to be their deliuerer out of the hands of the egyptians and this very action was a signe of their deliuerance which was to come to passe afterward it was i say a signe thus as he defended his brother and avenged his quarrell vpon the egyptian so in time to come the lord would by his hand giue them full freedome and deliuerance from the tyranny of pharaoh and all his and their enemy act beeing then a publicke person his example can prooue nothing for this purpose this question hath two distinct parts of which i will speake in their order the first part is when anger is a vertue amp lawful for answer hereof we must vnderstand that in iust and lawful anger there be three things a right beginning or motiue a right obiect and a right manner of beeing angry to the right beginning of anger three things are required first that the occasion of anger be iust and weightie as namely a manifest offence of god take an exaple or two moses in sundry places is said to be angrie amp the occasions of his anger were great as appeares in the particulars first because some of the israelits against god commandement had reserued manna till the next day exod again he was angrie because the israelites had tempted god in worshipping the golden calfe exod in numb moses againe is wrothe because coreh dathan and abiram rebelled against him and in him against god phinees numb is said to haue beene zealous that is angry for god the occasion was because the israelites committed fornication with heathenish woman dauid in like manner sam was angrie vpon this occasion because ammon his son had deffoured his sister thamar elijah is angry king v and why because the israelites forsooke the conenant of god cast downe his altars and had slaine his prophets with the sword nehemias chap ver is very angrie because the israelites oppressed one another with vsurie and other kinds of exactions ieremic also chap was angrie for this because the israelites were of vncircumcised hearts amp eares and the word of the lord was vnto them as a reproch amp they tooke no delight therein secondly it is required that anger be conceiued vpon counsell and deliberation pro establish thy thoughts by counsell if thoughts must be established by counsell then the affections amp so our anger also and the apostle saith iam be slow to wrath now the reason is plaine counsell ought to be the foundation of all our actions and therfore much more of our affections which are the beginnings of our actions thirdly iust and lawful anger must be kindled and stirred vp by good and holy affections as namely by desire to maintaine the honour and praise of god by the loue of iustice and vertue by hatred and detestation of vice and of all that is evill one saith well to this purpose that anger must attend vpon vertue and be stirred vp by it against sinne as the dogge attends vpon the sheepeheard and waites vpon his eie and hand when to follow him and when to pursue the wolfe the second thing in good anger is a fitte obiect or matter to worke vpon touching which two thing must be remembred first we must put a difference betweene the person and the offence or sinne of the person the sinne of the person is the proper obiect of anger and not the person but only by reason of the sinne thus dauid saies of himselfe that he was consumed with anger not because the man with whome he was angrie were his enemy but because they kept not god law psalm thus moses was angrie at the idolatry of the israelites wherewith they had sinned against god fourtie daies togither amp yet he praies earnestly vnto god for their persons as we read exod but it is alleadged to the contrarie that dauid directs his anger against the persons of his enemy especially in psalm answer first prophets as hath beene saide heretofore were endued with a speciall measure of zeale and their zeale was a pure zeale taken vp specially for the glorie and honour of god but our zeale against our enemy is commonly mixt with hatred enuy and selfeloue therefore we must not nay we cannot follow their examples secondly imprecations vsed by dauid were predictions rather then praiers for he rather foretold in them what should come to passe then prayed that it might come to passe thirdly dauid in his imprecations accurseth not his owne priuate enemy but the enemy of god and not al them but such onely as were incurable for by the spirit of prophecie he knew the state of those against whome he did pray so doe not we secondly we must put a difference betweene the cause and offence of god and the cause and offence of man now iust anger must be directed against persons for the offence of god properly and not for priuate offence but onely so farre forth as it tendeth to the offence of god thus mi iam and aaron murmured against moses because he had married a woman of ethopia but this was onely a priuate offence and therefore moses behaued himselfe meekely towardes them numb the third thing in good anger is the right manner of conceiuing it wherein these cautions are to be obserued first that our anger be mixed and tempered with charitie and loue it is the propertie of god himselfe in wrath to remember mercie hab and herein we must be like vnto him this was moses his practise who out of his loue praied for those with whome he was angrie exod secondly anger against any offence must be mixed with sorrow for the same offence thus christ was angrie with the iewes but withall he sorrowed for the hardnes of their hearts mark the reason hereof is this in any societie whatsoeuer it be if one member sinneth the sinne of that one member is the punishment of the rest that be in that societie euen as it is in the bodie if one part be affected and ill at ease the rest will be distempered paul saies of himselfe that he was afraid least when he came to the corinths god would humble him for their sinnes corinthian againe he teacheth that those which are fallen into any fault must be restored by the spirit of meekenes because we our selues are subiect to the same tentations gal and in this regard he would haue man to mourne with them that haue in them the cause of mourning rom thirdly iust anger must be contained within the bounds of our particular calling and civill decencie that is so moderated as it makes vs not to forsake our duties which we owe to god and man nor breake the rules of comlines thus iacob was angrie with laban and yet he speakes and behaues himselfe as a son to his father euen in his anger gen ionathan was angrie with saul his father and yet he withdrawes not any reuerent or dutifull respect from him sam the second part of the question is when anger is a vice and unlawful ans it is a sinne in fiue regards contrary to the former first when we conceiue it without counsell and deliberation this rash hastie sudden and violent anger is condemned by our sauiour christ mat whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly shalbe culpable of iudgment secondly when it is conceiued for no cause or for a light or trifling cause prou loue couers a multitude of sinnes therefore euery light offence must not be the cause of open anger prov it is the glory of a man to passe by some infirmities ecclesiastes take not notice of all the words that man speake no not of all those which servant speake vnto their masters besides that causelesse anger is many times forbidden in the scripture and paul saies that loue is hardly provoked because it will not be mooued to conceiue hatred but vpon weightie and important causes corinthian thirdly when the occasion is iust yet the measure of anger is immoderate ephesians be angry amp sinne not and if by infirmitie thou fall into it let not the sun goe downe vpon thy wrath the reason is added in the next words giue not place to the deuill because he is alwaies at hand to inflame the affection as he did sauls who therefore in his rage would haue killed him that was next him fourthly when it makes vs to forget our dutie to god or man and to fal to brawling cursing and banning thus was shemei angry when he railed vpon the king and flung stones at him and his servant giuing him bad and vnreuerent tearmes and calling him a man of blood and a man of belial sam thus did the disciples forget their dutie of loue vnto their brother and in anger desired that fire might come down from heauen and destroy the samaritanes luke thus the iewes in vndecent and vncharitable manner gnashed with their teeth at steven act and saint paul saies that the fruites of wicked anger are clamors and crying speeches between person and person in their fury ephesians and thence it is that we find balaam in his anger to haue beene more void of reason then his asse numb fistly when we are angrie for priuate respects concerning our persons and not concerning the cause of god thus cain is said to be exceeding wrothe and to haue his countenance cast downe onely vpon a priuate respect because he thought his brother abel should be preferred before him gen thus saul was wrath with dauid taking himselfe to be disgraced because the people after the slaughter of the philistimes ascribed to dauid ten thousand and to him but a thousand sam in like manner he was angrie with ionathan for his loue that he bare to dauid and for giuing him leaue to goe to bethleem sam thus nebuchadnezars wrath was kindled against the three children because he tooke himselfe to be contemned of them daniel thus haman meerely in regarde of priuate disgrace growes to great indignation against mordecai esther v thus asa was angry with the prophet hanani because he thought it a discredit to him to be reprooued at his hand chronicle and in this sort were the iewes filled with wrath at christs reproofe luke shewing thereby as it is truly expounded by the commenter that they were very hotte in their own cause and not in the cause of god ans the remedies thereof are twofold some consist in meditation and some in practise the remedies that stand in meditation are of three sorts some doe concerne god some our neighbour and some our selues the meditations cocerning god are specially sixe i meditation that god by expresse comandement forbiddes rash and vniust anger and commandeth the contrarie namely the duties of loue read for this purpose mat where we may obserue three degrees of vniust anger the first whereof is that which is inwardly conceiued and not outwardly shewed the second when vniust anger shewes it selfe by signes of contempt as by snuffing rushing changing and casting downe of the countenance the third is railing thou foole which is culpable of gehenna fire the highest degree of punishment now all these three degrees are murther and the punishment of a murtherer is to be cast into the lake of fire reverand againe christ commandeth vs to reward good for euill to blesse them that curse vs and to doe good to the that hate vs if we will be the children of our father which is in heauen mat and s paul wisheth vs to ouercome evill with goodnes rom ii meditation that all iniuries which befall vs doe come by god providence whereby they are turned to a good ende namely our good thus david saith that god had bidden shemei to curse him sam and this was the ground of christs reproofe of peter shall i not saith he drinke of the euppe which my father hath giuen me to drinke of ioh iii meditation god is long suffering even towards wicked man amp we in this point must be followers of him in regard of this god is said to be mercifull gracious slow to anger abundat in goodnes amp truth exod hence it was that he spared the old world yeres pet he spared the israelits after their idolatry yeres ezek besides this we haue example of the lowlines amp long suffering of christ who saith matth learne of me for i am humble and meeke and of whome it is said pet when he was reuiled he reuiled not againe when he suffered he threatned not but committed his cause to him that iudgeth righteously nowe because some may haply say that these examples of god and christ are too perfect for man to followe who cannot imitate god in all things therefore besides them consider further the examples of some of the servant of god moses when the people murmured at him did not answer them againe by murmuring but cried vnto the lord what shall i doe to this people for they be almost readie to stone me exod and steuen when he was stoned praied for his enemy lord lay not this sinne to their charge act iv meditation is concerning the goodnes of god towards vs an argument whereof is this that he doth euery day forgiue vs farre more offences then it is possible for vs to forgiue man v meditation all reuenge is god right and he hath not giuen it vnto man rom vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord and man by reuenging his own quarell makes himselfe both the iudge the witnesse the accuser and the executioner vi meditation is touching christs death he suffered for vs the first death and the sorrowes of the second death much more then ought we at his commandement to put vp small wrongs and iniuries without reuenge his commandement is resist not euill but whosoeuer shall smite thee on the right cheeke turne to him the other also matth againe destroy not him with thy meate for whome christ died rom the meditations concerning our neighbour are two the first is the condition of him with whome we are angrie namely that he is a brother let there be no strife betweene me and thee for we are brother gen againe he is created in the image of god we must not therefore seeke to hurt or destroy that image the second is concerning that equitie which we looke for at the hands of all man if we wrong any man we desire that he would forgiue vs and therefore we must forgiue him the iniurie that he doth vnto vs without vniust anger this is the very law of nature whatsoeuer ye would that man should doe vnto you euen so doe you vnto them matth meditations concerning our selues are sixe first he that conceiueth rush anger makes himselfe subiect to the wrath of god if he cherish the same without relenting matth if ye doe not forgiue man their trespasses no more will your father forgiue you your trespasses and matth iudge not that ye be not iudged yes when we pray to god to forgiue vs and doe not resolue to forgiue our brother we doe in effect say lord condemne vs for we will be condemned secondly we are commanded to loue one another euen as christ hath loued vs ephesians it is the propertie of loue to suffer and to beare and not to be prouoked to anger corinthian and it is a marke whereby god children are discerned from the children of the deuill that they loue their brother ioh thirdly we are ignorant of mens mindes in speaking and doing we know not the manner and circumstances of their actions and experience teacheth that much anger comes vpon mistaking and misconstruing them whereas contrariwise if they were throughly knowne we would not be so much incensed against man as commonly we are fourthly in rash anger we can doe no part of god worshippe that is pleasing to him we cannot pray for he that praies must lift vp pure hands without wrath tim we cannot be good hearers of the word for s iames wisheth vs to be swift to heare and slow to wrath because the wrath of man doth not accomplish the righteousnes of god iam fiftly we must consider what are the fruits and consequents of vniust anger for first it greatly annoies the health it annoies the braine and pulses it causes the gall to flow into the stomacke and the bowells it killeth and poisoneth the spirits and it is the next way to procure distemper of the whole bodie and consequently losse of health secondly it makes a man captiue to the deuill ephesians which we see to be true in sauls example who beeing a man full of wrath and giuing place to his owne rage and furie an euill spirit entred into him by the iust iudgement of god sixtly we must consider the causes of vniust anger it is commonly thought that anger is nothing but the flowing of choler in the gall and in the stomacke but the truth is anger is more then choler for it riseth first of a debilitie of reason and iudgement in the minde secondly from euill affections as from envy and selfe loue thirdly from the constitution of the bodie that is hote and drie againe we read in history that man hauing no gall haue notwithstanding beene full of anger and choler indeede is a furtherance but no cause of anger the remedies of vniust anger that stand in practise are especially fiue the first is in the time of anger to conceale the same both in word and deede the indignation of a foole saith salomon prou will be knowne the same day but the wise man couereth his shame that is he restraines his anger which if it should presently break forth wold be a reproch vnto him answerable to this notable speech of salomon was the wise counsell of ambros de obit theod ambrose to theodosius that after sentece giuen he should take daies respite before execution and not vnlike hath been the practise of the very heathen in their time socrates said i had beaten thee but that i was angrie a enodoru gaue augustus this rule that when he was angrie he should first say ouer the whole alphabet before he put in execution his anger secondly we must depart from them with who we are angry for this affectio is as a fire take the matter away from fire and it will cease to burne so let a man depart and employ himselfe for the time some other way and he shall soone cease to be angrie thus did ionathan depart out of his fathers presence sam abraham in his anger withdrew himselfe from lot gen iacob in wrath departed from esan gen thirdly we must auoide the occasions thereof as contentions and contentious persons doe nothing through contention philipp make no friendship with an angrie man neither goe with a furious man least thou learne his waies and receiue destruction to thy soule prou we must for this purpose be carefull to auoid all meanes that may serue to further the heate of the temperature of such a bodie as is apt and disposed to this vnruly passion fourthly we are to consider that we sinne against god not once or twise but often yes euery day and therefore the course of our anger must be turned against our own selues for our sinnes for this is one propertie of true repetance to work in vs a reuenge vpon our selues in regard of our sinnes committed against god and our brother corinthian fiftly we must accustome our selues to the daily exercises of inuocation of the name of god for this end that he in mercie would mortifie all our affections especially this corrupt amp violent affection of vniust wrath and this must we doe as at all times so then especially when anger is creeping vpon vs it will be saide of some our anger is violent and comes vpon the sudden and therefore these remedies will doe vs no good ans such persons when their mindes be quiet must often read and meditate of the foresaid remedies and by this meanes they shall be able to preuent hastines but what if we be ouertaken with anger what must we then doe ans if thou fall into it through infirmitie yet remember thy selfe let not the sun goe downe vpon thy wrath ephesians consider with thine owne heart that anger is as a poison if a man drinkes poison he must not suffer it to rest and flow into the bodie amp veines but with all speede must purge it out and so must anger be dealt withall whesoeuer we are ouertaken with it of questions concerning temperance temperance is a vertue that moderateth appetite or lust and this moderation of appetite stands in foure things concerning the moderation of appetite in the vse of riches there are two maine questions the answer of this question is the rather to be considered because this doctrine rightly conceiued and vnderstood serues greatly for the direction of the whole course of our liues vnto the ende here therefore i will first set downe the ground of the answer and then the answer it selfe the ground of the answer i propound in fiue rules i rule we must consider that riches and goods are of two sorts some are necessarie some are more then necessarie which the scripture calls abundance goods and riches are two waies necessarie necessarie to nature or necessarie to the person of a man goods necessarie to nature are those without which nature and life cannot be well preserued and these are most needefull necessary in respect of a mans person are those goods without which a mans state condition and dignitie wherein he is cannot be preserued now riches more then necessarie i terme those without which both the life of man and his good estate may well be preserued and whatsoeuer is besides them is necessary for example to the calling of a student meat drinke and cloth are necessarie in respect of nature besides these other things as bookes and such like are also necessarie for him in respect of his condition and place ii rule things and goods are to be iudged necessarie and sufficient not by the affection of the couetous man which is vnsa able but by two other things the iudgement of wise and godly man and the examples of sober and frugall persons iii rule we must not make one measure of sufficiencie of goods necessarie for all persons for it varieth according to the diverse conditions of persons amp according to time and place more things are necessarie to a publicke man then to a priuate and more to him that hath a charge then to a single man iv rule that is to be iudged necessarie which in some short time to come may be needefull though it haue no present vse for example the dowrie that a father giues to his daughter at the day of mariage though it be not presently needefull yet because in short time it may be necessarie therefore it is to be reputed amongst necessarie goods v rule we our selues doe often erre in iudgement in determining of things necessarie and sufficient for our selues amp therfore when man seeke things competent amp necessarie they must alwaies pray to god to giue them that which he knowes in his wisdome to be meete and necessarie not prescribing a measure vnto him i come now to the answer of the question which is twofold the first is this man may with good conscience desire and seeke for goods necessarie whether for nature or for his person according to the former rules but he may not desire and seeke for goods more then necessarie for if he doth he sinneth the reasons of this answer are these first deut the commandement is giuen to the king that hath most neede of abundance that he should not multiply his horse or his siluer or his gold that which the king may not doe the subiects ought much lesse to doe amp therfore they are not to multiply their goods for this cause it is a great fault in subiects remaining as they be subiects to seeke to attaine to the riches of princes againe paul saith tim hauing foode and raiment let vs be ther ith content besides that in the petition giue vs this day ampc we craue but onely bread for our substance that is meete to preserue vs for nature in that calling wherein we serue god day by day the prayer of agur is that god would giue him foode conuenient for him or as the wordes signifie bread of his statute that is which god in his counsell had appointed and ordained for him prov secondly seeking of abundance is a hazard to the saluation of the soule by reason of mans corruption therefore matth riches are called thornes that choke the word of god sowen in the heart and tim they that will that is desire to be rich and content not themselues with things necessarie fall into the snare of the deuill thirdly seeking of abundance is a fruite of diffidence in the prouidence of god now all frutes of vnbeleefe must be cut off we must not therefore desire more then necessarie in the next place for the better clearing of this doctrine the obiections of couetous man are to be answered obiect i good things are to be sought for but abundance is a good thing and a blessing of god ans good things are of two sorts some are simply good that is to say good both in themselues and to vs as remission of sinnes holinesse righteousnesse and life euerlasting in the kingdome of heauen and such like these may we desire and seeke for som again are good onely in part which though they be good in themselues yet are not alwaies good to vs of this kind is abundance of riches and store of wealth more then necessarie for nature and person for which cause riches in abundance are as the knife in the hand of a child likely to hurt if it be not taken away because they are in some man occasions of sinne vnlesse god in mercie preuent and hinder them and for our selues what know we whether god will keepe and preserue vs from sinne when we seeke and labour for abundance obiect ii it is the promise of god that riches and treasures shall be in the house of the iust psalm the answer is two fold first riches in scripture sometimes doe signifie only things sufficient and competent and of them is that place to be vnderstood to this purpose dauid saies that a small thing that is a competent and meane portion though but very little is to the iust man better then great riches to the wicked and mightie psalm and whereas dauid in another place affirmeth that nothing shall be wanting to them that feare god psalm and againe they which seeke the lord shall want nothing that is good the places are to be vnderstood with exception of the crosse amp correction in this sort that they shall haue competencie vnlesse the lord intend to chastice and correct them by want secondly if by riches dauid there meaneth abundance the words must be vnderstood with this condition if they be for their good for so all promises of temporal things must be limited with exception partly of god glory kingdome and will and partly of our good and saluation obiect iii we must doe good to the poore to the church to the common wealth and we must also leaue somewhat to posteritie i answer we may not doe euill that good may come thereof againe euery man is accepted of god according to that he hath and not according to that he hath not if there be a ready mind corinthian and the end of a mans calling is not to gather riches for himselfe for his familie for the poore but to serue god in seruing of man and in seeking the good of all man and to this end man must apply their liues and labours obiect iv we are called to imitate the ante prov amp which gathers in one season for her reliefe in another ans the ante gathers in sommer only things necessarie she doth not by the instinct of nature seeke superfluitie and more then is necessarie this doctrine serues to direct and informe almost all the world to beate downe the wicked practise of the vsurer amp to teach euery one of vs to moderate our care in things pertaining to this life the second part of the answer is this if god giue abundance when we neither desire it nor seeke it we may take it hold and vse it as god stewards abraham amp ioseph of arimathaea are commended for their riches and yet they obtained them not by their owne seeking and moiling after the manner of the world but walking in their callings god in his providence blessed and multiplytheir wealth for further proofe of this answer consider but one only place act where peter saies to ananias when it remained appertained it not vnto thee and when it was sold was it not in thy power these words import thus much that if we haue possessions and abundance we may with good conscience inioy them as blessings and gifts of god against this doctrine it is alleadged first that our sauiour saies it is a hard thing for him that hath riches to enter into the kingdome of god matthew ans the place is to be vnderstood of them that trust in their riches as it is expounded mark secondly it is obiected we must forsake all and become christs disciples by the commandement of christ luke ans a man must forsake al not simply but in regard of the daily disposition and preparation of his mind and so a man ought to forsake the things that are dearest vnto him because he must haue his minde resolued to forsake them againe man must be content to part with all not onely in affection but actually when it commeth to this point that either he must loose them or renounce christ thirdly it is alleadged that riches are called vnrighteous luke make ye friends of vnrighteous mammon therefore it seemes we may not haue them ans mammon is called mammon of iniquitie not because it is so in it selfe but because it is so in the common vse or rather abuse of wicked man and that in sundrie respects first because it is commonly though not alwaies vniustly gotten for it is a hard thing to become rich without iniustice secondly it is made ordinarily among sinnefull man an instrument of many euills thirdly euill gotten goods are vniustly possessed and no man can be truly tearmed rich that vniustly possesseth riches the answer to this question i propound in foure rules i rule they which haue riches are to consider that god is not only their soueraigne lord but the lord of their riches and that they themselues are but the stewards of god to employ and dispense them according to his will yes further that they are to giue an account vnto him both for the hauing and vsing of those riches which they haue and vse this rule is a confessed truth in the petition when we haue bread in our houses amp hands yes which is more in our mouthes when we are in the vse of the creature euen then are we taught to say giue vs this day our daily bread to signifie that god is our soueraigne and absolute lord and that when we haue the creatures we haue no vse of them vnlesse he giue it vnto vs againe the commandement luke giue an account of thy stewardship pertaines to all man that haue riches though it be but meate and bread ii rule we must vse speciall moderation of minde in the possessing and vsing of riches amp be content with our estate so as we set not the affection of our heart vpon our riches psalm if riches increase set not your heart vpon them that is place not your loue and confidence in them be not puffed vp with pride and ambition because you are rich luke woe be to you that are rich that is that put confidence in your riches matth blessed are the poore in spirit now pouertie of spirit is to beare pouertie with meekenes patience and obedience as a crosse imposed by god and in this sense the rich man may be said to be poore in spirit if he bestoweth not his loue and confidence vpon his wealth but in affection of heart is so disposed as if he were not rich but poore and this pouertie is necessarie euen in the middest of wealth because it will restraine the furie of the vntamed and vnruly affection againe christ saith matth he that looseth his life for my sake shall find it loosing there mentioned is not an actuall loosing but as before a disposition or preparation of the heart to loose for christs sake if neede be the dearest thing we haue that is our life and againe luke if any man come to me and hate not father and motheryea and his owne life also he cannot be my disciple that place is not spoken of actuall but of habituall hatred and this stands in a readinesse and inclination of the heart to hate if neede be father and mother yes our owne life for christ and the gospels sake to this purpose the apostle saith they that buie must be as though they possessed not corinthian that is in respect of moderation of the affection and the disposition of the heart for otherwise it is the law of nature that he that buies must possesse example of this moderation of the affection we haue in moses who esteemed the rebuke of christ greater riches then the treasures of egypt hebr and in dauid who though he were a king and a lord in the earth yet saith of himselfe that he was but a pilgrime and soiourner in it as all his fathers were psalm and he speakes this in respect of the affection of his heart and moderation thereof because he did not fixe the same vpon abundance and of paul who professeth in this manner i haue learned to be full and to be hungrie in all things i am instructed or entred in this high point of christian practise to be hungrie and to be full philip in which text two things are set down first that christian moderation or contentment is a high mysterie yes that it requires much skill amp arte to know how to be poore and how to be rich secondly that himselfe was a learner of this article and that he had bin but entred and initiated into the knowledge thereof now that this moderation of minde may be learned and practised we must remember that two especiall meanes are to be vsed first we must labour to be able to discerne betweene things that differ philip how is that by iudging aright betweene riches temporall and the true riches that will make a man rich before god this gift of discerning was in moses who vpon a right iudgement in this point accounted the rebuke of christ greater riches then the treasures of egypt hebr in dauid who saies that the lord was his portion when he was a king and euen in the middest of his riches psalm in paul who esteemed the best things that were but base yes drosse and dung that he might winne christ philipp the second meanes of moderation is to consider that we are in this world as pilgrimes and straungers pet that the best of vs brought nothing into the world neither shal whe we dy carry ought out of it iii rule we must vpon the calling of god forsake our riches and all that we haue in this world not onely in disposition of minde but in deede the word of god teacheth that there be three cases wherein a man is indeede to forsake all i if he be extraordinarily and immediately called to publish the gospel to all nation this was the case of the apostles and euangelists who in regard of their calling at least for vse forsooke all that they had matth ii in the case of confession when for professing the name of christ a man is depriued of them in the daies of triall thus when our sauiour saith whosoeuer he be that forsaketh not all that he hath ampc luke the words are spoken of all beleeuers in the case of confession when they are called by god vnto it and therefore s matthew explaines it thus whosoeuer ampc for my names sake he shall receiue ampc matth iii when in the time of persecution famine or war the necessitie is so great that it requires present releefe which can no other way be had but by giuing and selling the goods that a man hath in psalm the good man is saide to disperse to the poore this dispersing must not be vnderstoode of all times but in case of extreame neede again when christ saies luke ell al that thou hast this comandement must be limited for a man is not boud to sel al at al times but in the time of great and vrgent necessity thus the christias in the primitiue church in the daies of imminent persecution sold all their possessions act and so paul acknowledgeth that the church of corinthian releeued the church of macedonia euen beyond their abilitie in the daies of extremitie that was in that church corinthian here another question may be mooued whether a man may voluntarily and of his owne accord giue away all his goods liue vpon almes and giue himselfe to fasting and praier ans he may in popish conceit giue himselfe in this sort to voluntarie pouertie which they hold to be lawful and which is more a state of perfection we on the contrarie doe answer that this practise is in no sort lawful vnlesse a man haue speciall calling and warrant from god so to doe for first the law of nature sets downe and prescribes distinction of possessions and proprietie of landes and goods and the gospel doth not abolish the law of nature againe the same distinction and proprietie is allowable by the written law of god salomon teacheth prou that a man must let his water flow out of his cisterne but he must keepe the fountaine to himselfe and prou it is the blessing of god to be rich and he addeth no sorrowes to it man must not therefore voluntarily forsake their riches and so bring sorrow to themselues besides that agur praies against pouertie giue me saith he neither pouertie nor riches prou dauid makes it a curse to be a begger psalm and he neuer saw the righteous mans seede begging their bread psalm our sauiour christ biddes him that had two coates not to giue both away but one luke and paul saies it is a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue act therefore he biddes euery man to labour with his owne hands that he may neede nothing that is that he may not neede the releefe and helpe of any man or of anything thess but it is alleadged to the contrarie matth if thou n ilt be perfect sell all ans the wordes are a personall and particular commandement for this young prince whome christ speakes vnto was called to become a disciple of christ and to preach the gospel luke and the commandement is not giuen generally to all man but particularly to him alone and we cannot make a generall rule of a speciall commandement or example againe further it was a commandement of speciall triall secondly they alleadge matth possesse neither gold nor siluer nor money in your purses ans that commandement was temporall and giuen to the disciples but onely for the time of their first embassy into iurie as appeares in the v where christ bids them not to goe yet into the way of the gentiles and the commandements of their first embassy were reuersed afterward luke considering then that it belonged onely to their first embassy when they preached to the iewes it was not giuen them for all times iv rule we must so vse and possesse the goods we haue that the vse and possession of them may tend to god glorie and the saluation of our soules rich man must be rich in good workes and togither with their riches lay vp a good foundation in conscience against the euill day tim for the better pactizing of this rule take these three cautions i we must seeke to haue christ and to be in him iustified and sanctified and beeing in him then shall we in him and by him haue the holy vse of all that we haue some will say infidel haue the vse of riches ans they haue indeed and they are to them the gifts of god yet they so inioy them as that before god they are but vsurpers they be gifts of god in regard of god giuing but they are abuses and thefts in regard of their receiuing because they receiue them not as they ought a father giues a gift vnto his child vpon condition that he shall thus and thus receiue it now the child steales the gift that is giuen him and therefore hath it not in that manner that his father would he should haue it in like manner doe infidel steale and vsurpe the blessings of god to which they haue no iust title themselues being out of christ neither doe they vse them in that manner which god requireth sanctifying them by the word and prayer tim ii we ought to pray to god that he would giue vs his grace rightly to vse our riches to his glory and our own saluation for riches and other temporall blessings to sinfull me that haue not the gift to use the wel are dangerous euen as a knife in the hand of a child they are thornes and choake the grace of god they keepe those that trust in them from entrance into the kingdome of heauen yes they are the deuills snare whereby he catcheth the wicked amp holdeth them in it at his will and pleasure iii our riches must be emploied to necessarie vses these are first the maintenance of our owne good estate and conditions secondly the good of others specially those that are of our family or kindred tim he that prouideth not for his owne and namely for them of his houshould he denieth the faith and is worse then an infidell thirdly the releife of the poore according to the state and condition of euery man fourthly the maintenance of the church of god and true religion prov honour god with thy riches fiftly the maintenance of the common wealth giue tribute saith paul to whome tribute belongeth rom and giue vnto god saith christ the things that are god and vnto casar the things that are caesars matthew thus much touching the moderation of the appetite in the vse of riches in the second place follow those questions that concerne the moderation of our appetite in the vse of meate and drinke concerning which there are principally two the answer to the first whereof is the ground of the second ans there is a distinction and difference of meates to be obserued in sundrie respects i in respect of man for healths suks paul counselleth timothie drinke no more water drinke a little wine tim in which it is plaine that there is a distinction of meates approoued and commended for man for euery kinde of foode fittes not euery bodie meates therefore are to be vsed with difference man was not made for meate but meate for man ii in respect of scandall some are not to be vsed at some time and some are at the same time to be eaten thus paul professeth that rather then he would offend his brother he would eate no flesh while the world endureth corinthian and in rom he disputes the point at large touching the distinction of meates that is to be obserued in regard of offending them that are weake iii there is a distinction to be made in respect of civill and politicke order when for the common good of societies certaine kindes of meates for certaine seasons of the yeare are forbidden thus in our commo wealth there are appointed daies of flesh amp daies of fish not in respect of conscience but in regard of order for the common good of the country iv there is a difference of meates which ariseth vpon the bond of conscience so as it shall be a sinne to vse or not to vse this or that meate touching this difference before the flood the patriarches in all likelihood were not allowed flesh but only hearbs and the fruit of the ground gen after the flood flesh was permitted but blood forbidden gen from that time there was commanded a dististinction of meates wherof some were cleane some vncleane which distinction stood in force till the death of christ and that in conscience by vertue of diuine law but in the last daies all difference of meates in respect of obligation of the conscience is taken away and a free vse of all is giuen in that regard this the scripture teacheth in many places act the things that god hath purified pollute thou not peter in these words teacheth that all meats in the new testament in regard of vse were made cleane by god and therefore that no man by refusall of any kind of meates should thinke or make them vncleane againe rom the kingdome of god is not meate or drinke but righteousnes peace and ioy in the holy ghost for whosoeuer in these things serueth christ is acceptable to god and approoued of him hence it appeareth that in the apostles iudgement meat and drinke doth not make any man accepted of god whether he vseth or vseth it not but the worship of god is it that makes man approoued of him to the same purpose it is said corinthian meat doth not commend vs vnto god again column let no man condemne you in meat and drinke ampc ver if ye be dead with christ why as if ye liued in the world are ye burdened with traditions as touch not tast not handle not all which perish with the vsing here paul would not haue the collossians burdened with rites and traditions concerning meats so as if they vsed them not they should in cur the blame and condemnation of man but he would haue them to vse them freely and indifferently and his reason is double first because they were now freed in conscience from the bond of the ceremonial law touching meats and therefore they were in conscience much more freed from mens lawes secondly because these traditions are not the rules and commandements of god but the doctrine and precepts of man furthermore paul in tim foretells that there should be many in the latter daies that should command to abstaine from meates to which place the papist answers that that was because such persons taught that meats were vncleane by nature but the words are simply to be vnderstood of meates forbidden with obligation of the conscience and the text is generall speaking of the doctrine not of the persons of those man nor in ciuill respects but in regard of the bond of conscience lastly it is a part of christian libertie to haue freedome in conscience as touching all things indifferent and therefore in regard of meates to this doctrine some things are opposed by them of contrarie iudgement obiect i princes doe make lawes and in their lawes do forbidde meates and drinkes and they must be obeyed for consciece sake rom ans they doe so but all these lawes are made with reseruation of libertie of conscience and of the vse of that libertie to euery person but to what end then will some say are lawes made if they be made with reservation ans the scope of them is not to take away or to restraine libertie or the vse of libertie in conscience but to moderate the overcommon and superfluous outward vse as for that text rom it is to be vnderstood for conscience sake not of the law of the magistrate but of the law of god that bindes vs to obey the magistrates law obiect ii there was blood and things strangled forbidden in the counsell at ierusalem after christs ascension act ans it was forbidden onely in regard of offence amp for a time so long as the weake iewe remained weake not in regard of conscience and therfore afterward paul saies that all things euen blood it selfe was lawful though not expedient in regard of scandall corinthian and to the pure all things are pure tit obiect iii papists make lawes in which they forbidde some meats onely to restraine concupiscence ans then they should forbid wine as well as flesh for wine spice and some kindes of fish which they permit are of greater force to stirre vp lust then the vse of flesh and hence it is that saint paul exhorts man not to be drunke with wine wherein is excesse ephesians againe i answer that iust may be restrained by exhortation to temperance without prohibitory lawes for the obligation of the conscience which are flat against christian libertie vpon this answer a further question may be made whether a man may with good conscience eate flesh at times forbidden ans there are two kinds of eating eating against the law and besides the law eating against the law is when a man cats and by cating hinders the ende of the law contemns the authoritie of the law maker frustrates the law it selfe and withall by his eating giues occasion to others to doe the same this eating is a flat sinne against the fift commandement for it is necessarie that the magistrates laws should be obeyed in all things lawful heb the master and the parent must be obeyed in all lawful things much more the lawes of magistrates eating beside the law is when a man eats that which the law mentioneth and forbiddeth but not hurting the law and that a man may thus eate sundry cautions are to be obserued i this eating must be vpon iust cause in a mans owne selfe ii it must be without contempt of the lawmaker and with a loyall mind iii it must be without giuing offence to any by his bad example iv when it doth not hinder the maine end of the law v when the eater doth subiect himselfe to the penaltie voluntarily and willingly in this eating there is no breach in conscience neither is it a sinne to eate that which the law forbiddeth for man hath free libertie in conscience to eat that which he doth eate now if he vse his libertie and hurt no law obseruing these cautions his eating is no sinne for example it was god law that the priests only should eat the shew bread now dauid vpon a iust cause in himselfe all the former cautions obserued eates the shew bread and sinnes not because his conscience was free in these things and therefore dauids eating was not against the law but onely beside the law ans that we may so doe some things are to be done before we eate some in eating amp some after our eating the thing that is to be done before our eating is the consecratio of the food that is the blessing of the meates which we are to eate tim euery creature of god is sanctified by the word of god and prayer by sanctification there is not meant that whereby we are sanctified by the holy ghost neither that wherby the bread and the wine is halowed in the sacrament of the supper but it is this when we are assured that the creature is made so free and lawful to vs in respect of our vse that we may eate it freely and with good conscience by the word of god paul meanes the word of creation mentioned in gen amp repeated gen as also the word of god touching the libertie of conscience namely that to the pure all things are pure tit it is further added and prayer that is prayer grounded vpon the said word of creation and the doctrine touching christian libertie whereby wee pray for grace to god that we may vse the creatures holily to his glorie the reasons why this sanctification of our meat is to be vsed are these first that in the vse of it we may lift vp our hearts vnto god and by this meanes put a difference between our selues and the brute beast which rush vpon the creatures without sanctifying of them secondly that we may be admonished thereby touching the title we haue to the creatures which beeing once lost by the fall of adam is restored vnto vs again by christ thirdly that it may be an assured testimony to our heartes that we may vse the creature with libertie of conscience when we doe vse it fourthly that we may be sanctified to the vse of the creature as it is sanctified to vs to the end that we may vse it with temperance and not abuse it fiftly that when we vse the creature we may depend on god for the blessing of it to make it our nourishment for no creature can nourish of it selfe but by god commandement who as dauid saith psalm openeth his hand and filleth all things liuing of his good pleasure and in bread we must not consider the substance onely but the staffe which is the blessing of god vpholding our body sixtly that we may not grow to securitie forgetfulnes and contept of god amp so to prophanes in the vse of our meates and drinkes as the israelites did which sate downe to eate and drinke and rose vp to play now besides these reasons we haue also the examples of holy man this blessing of the meat was so knowne a thing of auncient times that the poore maides of ramath zophim could tell saul that the people would not eate their meate before the prophet came and blessed the sacrifice sam christ in his owne family would not eate of the fiue loaues and two fish till he had looked vp to heauen and geuen thankes mark paul tooke bread in the shippe and gaue thanks in the presence of all that were with him act the vse of the first point is i by this doctrine all persons are taught but specially gouerners of others as masters of families amp parents neuer to vse either meates or drinkes or any other blessing that they receiue at the hands of god but with praise amp thanksgiuing for this which is said of meates and drinkes must be inlarged also to the vse of any benefite blessing or ordinance that we take in hand to vse or inioy ii though we doe not simply condemne but allow of hallowing of creatures yet we detest popish consecration of salt creame ashes and such like first because papists halow them for wrong endes as to procure by them remission of sinnes to driue away deuills ampc secondly because they sanctifie creatures without the word yes though they doe it by praier yet it is praier without the word which giueth no warrant thus to vse the creatures or to these endes and therefore of the same nature with magical inchantments thirdly if the creature must be sanctified for our vse before we can vse it then we our selues must be sanctified both in soule and bodie before we can be sitte for the vse and seruice of god looke as the creature by the hand and prouidence of god is presented before vs to serue vs so must we beeing strengthned and nourished by the same giue vp our selues soules and body to serue and honour him yes our sanctifying of the creature to our holy vse should put vs in minde of sanctifying our selues to his glorie so soone as the prophet esay was sanctified by god vnto his office then he addressed himselfe and not before and said lord i am here isaiah and so we our selues before we can performe any acceptable dutie vnto god must be purged and clensed the sonnes of aaron would not doe this honour vnto god by sanctifying his name before the people and therefore god glorified himselfe in their death and temporall destruction leuit and when moses the servant of god failed in the sanctification of his name by the circumcision of his son god hand was vpon him to haue destroied him this point is duely to be obserued of all but principally of such as are appointed to any publike office if they will serue god therein with comfort and incouragement they must first labour to be sanctified before him both in their soules and body i come now to the second thing required for the right and lawful vse of meates and drinkes namely a christian behauiour while we are in vsing them for the better vnderstanding whereof we are to consider two points first what we may doe and then what we must doe in vsing the creatures i touching the former we may vse these gifts of god with christian libertie and how is that not sparingly alone and for meere necessitie to the satisfying of our hunger and quenching of our thirst but also freely and liberally for christian delight and pleasure for this is that libertie which god hath graunted to all beleeuers thus we read that ioseph and his brother with him did eate and drinke together of the best that is liberally gen and to this purpose dauid saith that god giueth wine to make glad the heart of man and oyle to make the face to shine as well as bread to strengthen the bodie psalm and the lord threatneth to bring a punishment vpon his people agg in that he would giue them his creatures indeede but such a portion of the as should onely supplie their present necessities and no more ye shall eate saith he but ye shall not haue enough ye shall drinke but ye shall not be filled againe we read that levi the publican made our sauiour christ a great feast in his owne house luke at the marriage in caua a towne of galile where christ was present the guests are said according to the manner of these country to haue drunke liberally ioh and at an other place in supper time marie is saide to haue taken a boxe of pretious and costly oyntment and to haue annointed his feete there with so as the whole house was filled with the sauour of the ointment ioh iudas indeede thought that expense which shee had made superstuous but christ approoues of her act and commendeth her for it i adde further that by reason of this libertie purchased vnto vs by christ we may vse these and the like creatures of god with ioy and reioycing this is the profit that redoundeth vnto man in the vse of them that he eate and drinke and delight his soule with the profit of his labours ecclesiastes the practise hereof we haue in the acts ch v where they of that church that beleeued are saide to eate their meate together with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart and yet this reioycing in the creatures must be limited with this clause that it be in the lord that is to say a hurtlesse and harmelesse ioy tending to the glorie of god and the good of our neighbour this condemneth the common practise of the world who solace and delight themselues in the vse of god creatures but so as with their ioy is ioyned the ordinarie traducing of the magistrate minister and those that feare god and will not run with them to the same excesse of riot pet ii the second point is what we must doe when we take the benefit of god creatures a matter of great consequent in the liues of man and it is this that we vse our libertie in the lord and whether we eate or eate not we must doe both to the lord rom this is done by labouring both in eating and in abstinence to approoue the same vnto god vnto his saints and vnto our own conscieces wherein appeareth a manifest differece between the wicked amp the godly man for the one when he eateth or drinketh he doth it in the lord and to the lord the other doth it not to the lord but to himselfe that is to the satisfaction amp contentment of his owne carnall delight and pleasure that a man may eate to the lord there are foure things distinctly to be obserued i that in our eating we practise iustice salomon saith the bread of deceit that is gotten by unlawful meanes is sweet vnto a man but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravell prov and paul giues a rule to the church of thessalonica that euery man should eate his owne bread that is the bread which is procured and deserued by his owne iust and honest labour thess this first thing serues to checke a number of man that liue in the daily practise of iniustice by spending their goods in good fellowship at tauernes and ipling houses neglecting in the meane while the maintenance of their own charge by following their honest labour and by this meanes doe euen robbe their families of their due and right ii that we may eate to the lord we must practise loue amp charitie in our eating how is that first we must giue offence to no man whatsoeuer it is good saith paul neither to eate flesh nor to drinke wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth is offended or made weake rom secondly in our eating we must haue respect of the poore thus nehemiah exhorteth the iewes that were mourning for their sinnes to be chearefull to eate of the fat and drinke the sweete and send part vnto them for whome none was prepared that is to them that were poore nehem and the prophet amos inueigheth against some of the princes of israel who drunke wine in bowles and annointed themselues with the chiefe ointments and were not sorrie for the affliction of ioseph that is did not releeue the poore brother that were led captiue and wanted foode and maintenance amos iii we must vse our meate in sobrietie sobrietie is a gift of god whereby we keepe a holy moderation in the vse of our diet prov when thou sit test to eate ampc consider diligently what is set before thee and put the knife to thy throat that is be very carefull and circumspect in taking thy foode bridle thine appetite take heede thou doest not exceede measure if it be asked what rule of moderation is to be obserued of all whether they be man or woman young or old i answer first one mans particular example must not be a rule of direction to all in the east country we read that man haue liued and doe yet liue a great time with a little for example with parched corne and a cake now this example of theirs is no rule to vs that liue in these parts for their country is hotter then ours and therefore lesse might serue them then vs we are hot within and so our appetite is the more strong againe in eating we may not iudge or condemne him that eateth more or lesse then we our selues because his eating is no rule to vs in this case secondly a mans owne appetite is not to be made a rule of eating for others for a ma must not eate so long as his stomacke craues meate least he fal into the sinne of gluttonie rom and this sinne is noted by our sauiour christ to haue beene in the old world in the daies of noah mat whe they gaue themselues to eating and drink like the brute beast for so the word signifies if then neither example nor appetite may rule our eating what be the right rules of christian moderation in this behalfe ans that we may not exceede measure we must keepe or serues within these limits first our food must not goe beyond the condition place abilitie and maintenance that god hath giuen vs john the baptist being in the wildernesse contented himselfe with very meane fare agreable both to the manner of that countrey and to his owne calling and condition of life his meate was locusts and wild hony mat secondly it must be framed to the order and difference of time amp place against this rule the rich glutton offended who fared deliciously euery day without any difference of time or place luke salomon pronounceth a woe to that land whose princes eate in the morning eccl s paul notes it a fauit in a minister to be giuen to wine tim that is a comon tipler amp one that loues to sit by the wine morning amp euening day by day thirdly euery man must eat and drinke so much as may serue to maintain the strength of his nature of his bodie and mind yes so much as may serue to vphold the strength of grace in him salomon the king of israel would haue all princes to eate in time for strength and not for drunkennes eccl esay notes it as a iudgement of god vpon man when they vse feasting and mirth and haue not grace to consider the workes of god esay our sauiour would haue all man so to eate and drinke that they may be the fitter to watch and pray luke and the apostle paul exhorteth man not to be drunke with wine wherein is excesse but to be filled with the holy ghost ephesians his meaning is that man ought so to eate and drinke that their body mindes and senses may not be made thereby more heauie but rather more lightsome and able to performe their duties to god and man for if they so eat as that thereby they be hindred in this behalfe they are guiltie of excesse and riot which is greatly displeasing to god and offensiue to man this rule serueth to admonish somepersons who as the prouerb is are good forenoone man but bad afternoonemen because in the morning they be sober but for the most part ouer come with drinke after dinner iv euery man must eate his meat in godlines this is indeed to eat vnto the lord and it may be done by obseruation of these rules first by taking heed of the abuse of any creature appointed for foode by intemperance this abuse holy iob suspected in his sonnes while they were a feasting and therefore he sent day by day and sanctified them and offered vp burnt offerings vnto god according to the number of them all iob secondly by receiuing the creatures as from the hand of god himselfe for this very end did god by expresse word giue vnto adam euery hearth bearing seede which was vpon the earth and euery tree wherein was the fruit of a tree bearing seed for his meat that he might receiue it as god had giuen it vnto him from his owne hand gen thus moses said vnto the israelites touching manna this is the bread which the lord hath giuen you to eate exod this dauid acknowledged saying thou giuest it them amp they gather it thou openest thy hand and they are filled psalm and the lord vpbraideth israel with this fault by the prophet hosea she did not acknowledge that i gaue her corne and wine and oyle and multiplyed her siluer and gold hos yes it is noted as an argument of god loue to israel by the prophet ioel that he sent them corne wine and oyle that they might be satiffied therewith ioel by this dutie are iustly to be reprooved the carelesse and godlesse behauiours of sundry persons who with the swyne feed vpon the creatures of god but neuer lift vp their eies or hands vnto him of whome and from whome they doe receiue them the verie bruit beast can teach them a better lesson for as dauid saith the lyons roaring after their pray doe seeke their meat from god psalm yes the heauens and the earth and all that are in them doe alwaies depend vpon his prouidence and are altogither guided and directed by him iob and shall not man much more haue an eye vnto his creator and wholly depend vpon him for all blessings from whom he receiues life and breath and all things thirdly we must receiue these creatures from god our father as tokens of our reconciliation to him in christ so saith saint paul giuing thankes alwaies for all things to god euen the father in the name of our lord iesus christ ephesians thus we hold and receiue god blessings and he that holds and receiues them otherwise is an vsurper and not a right and lawful possessour of them fourthly we must learne to be content with that portion that god assigneth to vs be it neuer so small and withall labour to see the goodnes of god euen in the meanest fare that may be our table is as it were a liuely sermon to vs of god speciall providence over our body for first in reason dead flesh should rather kill vs then giue vs nourishment and yet by his blessing amp providence it continueth life and strength againe both we and our meat are but perishing and therefore when we feede theron it may serue to stirre vs vp to seeke for the food of the soule that nourisheth to life euerlasting ioh furthermore looke as euery creature serues for our vse euen so should we our selues consecrate our selues vnto god and serue him both with our soules and body as before hath beene shewed the third and last point is what we are to doe and how to behaue our selues after our meat this moses teacheth the israelites deut when thou hast eaten and filled thy self thou shalt blesse the lord thy god this praising or blessing of god stands in two things first in a holy remembrance that god hath giuen vs our food for beeing once filled we must take heed we forget not god who hath opened his hand and plenteously refreshed our body with his creatures deut secondly we must make conscience in liew of thankfulnesse to god to employ the strength of our body in seeking his glorie and walking according to all his lawes and comandements whether ye eate or drinke or whatsoeuer ye doe doe all to the glorie of god corinthian we may not liue idlely amp giue our selues to riot and gaming but labour to serue god and our countrey in some profitable course of life least it be said of vs as it was once of the old iewes that we sitte downe to eate and drinke and rise vp to play to this i adde one thing further that when we haue eaten to our contentment and something remaine care must be had to reserue it and not to cast it away for this purpose we haue the example of christ who commandeth to gather vp the broken meate that remaineth that nothing be lost ioh the reason is because these reliques and fragments are part of the creatures yes they are as well god good creatures as the rest were and must be preserued to the same vse now if these may not be abused or lost much lesse ought the gifts of the minde which are greater and farre more precious be suffered to miscarie but rather to be preserued and increased a good lesson for such as haue receiued any speciall gifts of nature or grace from god that they mispend them not or suffer them to perish but carefully maintaine them to the glorie of god and the good of others to conclude this question we are all to be exhorted to make conscience of this dutie to vse the good blessings of god in such sort as they may alwaies tende to the honour of the giuer auoiding all excesse and riot reasons to mooue vs hereunto may be these i excesse destroyes the bodie and kills euen the very naturall strength and life thereof ii it brings great hurt to the soule of man in that it annoyeth the spirits it dulleth the senses it corrupteth the naturall heate and good temper of the bodie now these things beeing the helpes and next instruments of the soule if they be once corrupted and decaied the soule it selfe will at length be brought to the same passe iii let this be considered that a woe belongs vnto them that eate and drinke immoderately isaiah and for this very sinne the lord led his owne people into captiuitie v yes the drunkard and the glutton shall become poore prov and both shall equally with there pompe and excesse descend into hell esay iv we should be willing to part from all for christs sake much more from our excesse and shall we thinke it possible for a man to forsake all even his owne life that will not forsake excesse and intemperance in the vse of god creatures it will be said of some we are not drunken though we drinke much ans it is a policie of the deuill to delude man withall when he perswades them that much drink is not amisse if a man be not ouertaken therewith for it is a sinne to liue and sitte daily by the wine to be alwaies bibbing and sipping wee know not when or where we shall die and we are commanded to watch ouer our harts that we be not ouercome with surfetting and drunkennesse what a madnesse then is it to giue over our selues to such immoderate excesse whereby we are vtterly disabled from these and all other duties of godlinesse in the third place we come to those questions that concerne the moderation of our appetite in the vse of apparell and of this kind there be two principall questions the former of them beeing nothing else but an introduction to the latter ans there is a lawful vse of these things yet not in all but onely in themto whome they belong reasons of the answer are these i gold and siluer ampc are the gifts of god and serue not onely for necessitie but for ornament and comelinesse ii we haue the examples of sundrie persons in scripture which doe warrant the vse of these creatures and blessings of god abraha by his steward sends vnto rebecca a golden abiliment or earing of halfe a shekel weight and two bracelets of tenne shekels weight of gold gen and it is said that when shee receiued it she ware the iewell of gold in her forehead and the bracelets vpon her hands verse ioseph beeing advanced in pharaohs court had the signet of pharaoh put vpon his hand and a chaine of gold about his necke and was arayed in fine linnen all which were the ornamets of princes in those country gen againe all the israelites did were earings of gold which afterward they tooke off from their eares and gaue them to aaron to make thereof the golden calfe exod and they are not blamed for wearing them but because they put them to idolatrous vses so it is said of king salomon that he had siluer in such abundance that according to his state he gaue it in ierusalem as stones cron and christ speaketh of the royaltie of salomon as of a rare and excellent thing which himselfe approoued howsoeuer he preferres the glorie of the lilies of the field before it matthew the daughter of pharaoh is said to be brought vnto salomon in a vesture of gold of ophir that is in a garment of the finest beaten gold psalm all these examples doe shewe thus much that there is a lawful vse of these things in them to whom they appertaine against this doctrine some things are obiected obiect i in some places of scripture woman are forbidden to weare costly apparell and gold for paul willeth timothie that the woman aray themselues in comly attire not with broidored haire or gold or pearles or costly apparell tim and to the same purpose peter speaketh i pet ans first these ornaments are not by paul and peter simply forbidden but the abuse of them in riot and excesse for persons that were in those times called were of meaner estate and the churches in the daies of the apostles cosisted for the greater part of poore base and meane man and woman corinthian these things therefore are forbidden them because the vse of golde and pretious ornaments is nothing els but meere riot in those that are but of a meane condition secondly i answer that the apostles in the places alleadged doe reprooue a great fault which was common and ordinarie in those daies for man and weomen desired amp affected the outward adorning and trimming of their body accounting the outward ornament which consisted of gold pearle and costly apparell to be the principall whereas indeede the chiefe ornaments of a christian should be the vertues of modestie and humilitie seated in the minde and restified in the outward carriage obiect ii the prophet esay condemneth these things in particular for it seemeth that he had viewed the wardrobes of the ladies of the court in ierusalem chap ampc where he makes a catalogue of their speciall attires and ornaments and pronounceth the iudgements of god against them all ans some of the ornaments which the prophet there mentioneth are indeed meere vanities that were of no moment and serued to no necessarie or conuenient vse or ende at all againe others of them were in themselues things lawful and the prophet doth not condemne the at all as they haue meete and conuenient vse but he condemnes them in this regard because they were made the instruments and signes of the pride wantonnesse vanitie and lightnes of those woman the truth of this answer will appeare if we consider the v of that chapter where the prophet shews what his drift was in speaking of those things not to condemne all ornaments but the pride of the daughters of ierusalem and their hautines and wantonnesse testified by diverse particular behauiours there mentioned againe some of the things there named were the like if not of the same kind with those which abraham sent to rebecca and which shee did weare gen and therefore we may not thinke that the prophet intendeth to condemne all things there specified but onely the abuse of them as they were then misapplied to wrong endes and serued to proclaime to the world the pride and wantonnes of the hearts of that people answer in the vse of apparell two things are to be considered the preparation of it when it is to be worne amp the wearing when it is prepared i rule our care for apparell and the ornaments of our body must be very moderate this our sauiour christ teacheth at large math from the to the v where commanding man to take no thought for apparell he forbids not all care but the curious and immoderate care the reason is added because they which walke in their callings and doe the duties thereof with diligence shall haue by god blessing all things needfull prouided and prepared for them he that dwells in a borrowed house will not fall a trimming of it and suffer his owne hard by to become ruinous in like manner our bodie is the house of our soule borrowed of god and by him lent vnto vs for a time and we are but his tenants at will for we must depart out of it at his commandement and therefore our greatest care must be emploied vpon our soules and the other which concerneth the adorning of our bodie must be but moderate againe god in his prouidence clotheth the very hearbs of the field therefore much more is he carefull for man and paul saith if we haue foode and rament we must therewith be content tim that is if we haue foode and rayment necessarie for vs and ours we ought to quiet our hearts and haue no further care for our apparell it will be saide how shall we know what is necessarie answer a thing is necessarie two waies first in respect of nature for the preseruation of life and health secondly in respect of place calling and condition for the vpholding and maintenance thereof now we call that necessarie rayment which is necessarie both these waies for example that apparell is necessarie for the scholer the tradesman the countrey man the gentleman which serueth not onely to defend their body fro cold but which belongs also to the place degree calling and condition of them all if it be asked who shall determine and iudge what is necessarie to these persons and purposes i answere vaine and curious persons are not to be competent iudges hereof but in these things we must regard the iudgement and exaple of modest graue and frugall persons in euery order and estate who vpon experience and knowledge are best able to determine what is necessarie and what is not againe though we must not seeke for more then necessarie apparell yet if god of his goodnes giue vs abilitie to haue and maintaine more we must thankefully receiue it and become good stewards of the same for the good of man but some will say it seemes that we ought not to keepe abundance when god giues it because we may not haue aboue one coate for john giues this rule luke let him that hath two coates giue to him that hath none ans iohns meaning must needes be this he that hath not onely necessarie rayments but more then necessarie he must giue of his abundance to them that want for otherwise his rule should not agree with christs own practise who had himselfe two coates an inner and an vpper garment which he kept and wore nor with s pauls who had both a cloke and a coate this rule discouers the common sinnefull practise of many man in the world the greater sort of man are exceedingly carefull by all meanes and waies to follow the fashion and to take vp euery new fangled attire whensoeuer it comes abroad a course flat contrarie to christs doctrine which commandeth an honest care onely for necessarie ornaments and condemneth the contrarie and that vpon speciall reason because this inordinate and affected care is commonly a great picke purse it fills mens heades and hearts with vaine and foolish thoughts it makes them wastfully to abuse the blessings of god giuen vnto them whereby they are disabled from helping others that are in neede whereas the first and principall care ought to be for the adorning of the soule with grace and putting on the lord iesus and this is it which will yeeld more comfort to the minde and conscience then any externall formalitie to the outward state of man ii rule all apparell must be fitted to the bodie in a comely and decent manner such as becommeth holinesse tit if it be here demanded how we should thus frame and fashion our attire the answer is by obseruing the rules of decencie and comelinesse which are in number seauen first that it be according to the sexe for man must prepare apparell for man weomen for weomen this rule is not ceremoniall but grounded vpon the law of nature and common honestie deut the woman shall not weare that which pertaineth vnto the man neither shall a man put on womans raiment for all that doe so are abomination to the lord thy god secondly our apparell must be made according to our office that is such as may be fit and conuenient for vs in respect of our calling that it may not hinder or disable vs in the performance of the duties thereof whereupon comes iustly to be condemned the kinde of apparell specially of woman that is vsed in this age for it makes them like to an image in a frame set bolt vpright whereby it comes to passe that they can not goe well and with ease or conueniencie about any good busines but must of necessitie either sit or stand still thirdly our attire must be according to our abilitie and maintenance either in lands or in goods and substance we must as the common prouerbe is shape our coate according to our cloath that so we may not be in want but haue sufficient wherewith to maintaine our families and to releeue the poore which also serueth to condemne the sinne of many persons who lay vpon their backes whatsoeuer they can scrape and gather together in the meane while neglecting the honest maintenance of their own estates for time to come and the necessarie releefe of them that are in distresse and want fourthly it must be answerable to our estate and dignitie for distinction of order and degree in the societies of man this vse of attire stands by the very ordinance of god who as he hath not sorted all man to al places so he will haue man to fitte themselues and their attire to the qualitie of their proper places to put a difference between themselues and others thus we read that ioseph being by phaaroh set ouer all the land of egypt was arayed with garments of sine linnen and had a golden chaine put vpon his necke to put a difference betweene him and the inferiour princes of pharaoh gen thus in auncient times the captaines and cheife of the armies did weare fine garments of diverse colours of needle worke to distinguish them from others iud thus in kings courts they went in soft rayment and the poorer people in baser and rougher attire matthew by which it appeares that many in these daies do greatly offend for man keepe not themselues within their owne order but the artificer commonly goes clad like the yeoman the yeoman like the gentleman the gentleman as the nobleman the nobleman as the prince which bringeth great confusion and vtterly ouerturneth the order which god hath set in the states and condions of man fiftly mens attire is to be framed and prepared according to the ancient and receiued custome of the countrey wherein they are brought vp and dwell touching this rule it is demanded whether if a man see a fashion vsed in other coutries he may not take it vp here and vse it ans he may not for god hath threatned to visite all such as are cloathed with strange apparell zeph and paul taxeth it as a great disorder in the church of corinthian and euen against nature that man went in long haire and woman went vncouered corinthian and if this be so then what a disorder is that when man of one country frame themselues to the fashions and attires both of man and woman of other nation this one sinne is so common among vs that it hath branded our english people with the blacke marke of the vainest and most newfangled people vnder heauen if a stranger comes into our land he keepes his ancient amp customeable attire without varying or alteration we on the contrary ca see no fashion vsed either by the french italian or spanish but we take it vp and vse it as our owne sixtly the garments that we make to couer our body must be such as may expresse the vertues of our mindes specially the vertues of modestie frugalitie shamefastnes they should be as a booke written with text letters wherein at the first any man may read the graces that be in the hart thus paul exhorteth weomen that they aray themselues with comely apparell in shamefastnesse and modesty not with broidered haire ampc but as becommeth weomen that professe the feare of god with good workes tim and our sauiour commandeth that the light of our conuersation euen in outward things should so shine vnto me that they seeing our good works may glorifie the father which is in heauen mat seuenthly it must be framed to the example not of the lighter and vainer sort but of the grauest and the most sober of our order and place both of man amp weomen we haue no expresse rule in scripture touching the measure and manner of our apparell and therefore the wise and graue presidents of good and godly man that are of the same or like degree with our selues ought to stand for a rule of direction in this behalfe to which purpose paul exhorteth whatsoeuer things are pure honest of good report if there be any vertue ampc thinke of these things which ye haue both learned and receiued and heard and seene in me those things doe philipp examples hereof we haue many in the word of god of john the baptist who had his garments of camels haire mat of elijah who is said to be a hairie man in respect of his attire and to be girded as john was with a girdle of leather about his loines king for these rough garments were the principal raiments of prophets in those times and places as we read zach and it was the ordinarie fashion of the iewish nation to vse goats hair not onely for making of their apparel but euen of the curtaines that were made for the vse of the sancturie exod if this rule were practised it would serue to cut off many scandalous behauiours in the conuersations of man for now a daies man doe striue who shal goe before another in the brauest and costliest attire hauing little or no respect at all to the examples of godly and sober persons of their degrees and places and this their excessiue pride and vanitie is ordinarily maintained by vniust dealing in lying and deceipt by couetousnes and vnmercifulnesse to the poore sinnes which are so greatly dishonourable vnto god that the very earth wherupon man doe liue can hardly endure the same wherfore those that fear god and haue a care to serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse ought to hate and detest these courses renouncing the curious vanity of the world and testifying the graces and vertues of their minds vnto man even by their graue and sober gestures and habits of their body the second thing to be considered in the right vse of apparell is the wearing and putting of it on touching which two speciall rules are to be obserued i rule that we weare and put on our apparell for those proper ends for which god hath ordained the same the ends of apparell are specially these first for necessitie sake that is for the defending of the body from the extremitie of parching heate and the pinching cold and consequently the preseruing of life amp health this was the end for which garments were first made after the fall and the reason of it is this whilest man was yet in the state of innocencie before his fall ther was a perfect temperature of the aire in respect of mans bodie and so there was no need of garments and nakednesse then was no shame vnto man but a glorious comelines now after that adam and in him al mankind had sinned vanitie came vpon all the creatures amp amongst the rest vpon the aire a maruelous distemperature in respect of heat and cold for the remedie whereof it was ordained that adam should weare apparell which god hauing once made and appointed he hath euer since blessed it as his owne ordinance as daily experience sheweth for our attire which is void of heat and life doth notwithstanding preserue mans bodie in heat and life which it could not doe if there were not a speciall prouidence of god attending vpon it the second ende of apparell is honestie for to this ende doe we put it on and weare it for the couering and hiding of that deformitie of our naked body which immediately followed vpon the transgression of our first parents and in this respect also were garments after the fall appointed by god for the vse of man it is obiected that esay prophecied naked and bare foot isaiah and so did saul sam i answer first that which the prophet did was done by commandement as may appeare in the second verse of that chapter for the lord gaue him commandement so to doe againe he is saide to be naked because he put off his vpper ent which was sackcloath or some other rough garment that prophets vsed to wenre but it cannot be prooued that he put off that garment which was next his flesh and skinne concerning saul there be two answers giuen one that he put off his vpper garment as esay did for we are not to imagine that he prophecied naked it beeing so vnseemely a thing and euen against the law of nature since the fall the other answer and that according to the true meaning of the text is that saul before the spirit of prophecie came vpon him had put on and wore his warrelike attire wherewith he went out to take dauid but when the spirit came vpon him then he put off his militarie habite and went in other attire after the manner and fashion of a prophet and so prophecied and therefore whereas he is saide to goe naked the meaning is that he stript himselfe of his armour which both himselfe and his messengers vsed in pursuing after dauid now touching the couering of the bodie with apparell these things are to be remembred first that it must be couered in decent and seemely sort thus ioseph wrapped christs bodie that was dead in a cleane linnen cloath together with the spice matthew secondly the whole bodie must be couered some onely parts excepted which for necessitie sake are left open and bare as the hands and face because there is an ignominious shame not only on some parts but ouer the whole bodie and here comes to be reproued the affected nakednesse vsed of sundry persons who are wont to haue their garments made of such a fashion as that their neck and brests may be left for a great part vncouered a practise full of vanitie and cleane contrary to this rule grounded in corrupted nature for if the whole body be ouer spread with shame by sinne why should any man by such practise as much as in him lies vncouer his shame to the view of the world the ende of attire is to hide the shamefull nakednes of the bodie from the sight of man but such persons as these are doe hereby expresse the vanitie and lightnes of their mindes by leauing some parts of their body open and vncouered wherein what doe they else but euen display and manifest vnto man and angels their owne shame and ignominie nay what doe they else but glorie in that which is by the iust iudgement of god reprochfull vnto them let all those that feare god and are humbled in the consideration of their sinnes which are the matter of the shame of mankinde be otherwise affected a third ende of apparell is the honouring of the bodie to this purpose s paul saith corinthian vpon those members of the bodie which we think most vnhonest put on the greater honour ampc v god hath tempered the bodie together and giuen the more honour to that part which lacked and in thess it is the will of god ampc that euery one of you should know how to possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour these words are spoken of chastitie but they are generally to be vnderstood of any other vertue belonging to the bodie now the reason of this ende is plaine for the bodie of euery beleeuer is the temple of the holy ghost and a member of christ in the kinde and place as well as the soule therefore it ought to be both holily and honourably vsed for the honouring of the bodie with outward ornaments we must remember this distinction some ornaments are inward and some are borrowed inward are the graces and gifts of god these are our owne borrowed are gold siluer pearles and pretious stones and these are outward and of the two more speciall care ought to be had of the inward then of the outward and borrowed for these are indeede faire and honourable in the opinion and estimation of man but the other are farre more honourable in the sight of god and therefore saint peter exhorteth weomen that their apparell be not outward as with broidered haire and gold set about or in sumptuous garments but that the hidden man of the heart be vncorrupt with a meeke and quiet spirit which is before god a thing pretious pet now that we may vse our apparell to the endes before rehearsed we are yet further to obserue some speciall rules which may serue for our direction in the right adorning of the bodie first euery one must be content with their owne naturall fauour and complexion that god hath giuen them and account of it as a pretious thing be it better or be it worse for the outward forme and fauour that man hath is the worke of god himselfe fitted and proportioned vnto him in his conception by his speciall prouidence beeing then the lord owne worke and his wil thus to frame it rather then otherwise great reason there is that man should rest contented with the same here comes to be iustly reprooued the straunge practise and behauiour of some in these daies who beeing not contented with that forme and fashion which god hath sorted vnto them doe deuise artificiall formes and fauours to set vpon their body and faces by painting and colouring thereby making themselues seeme that which indeede they are not this practise is most abominable in the very light of nature and much more by the light of god word wherein we haue but one onely example thereof and that is of wicked iesabel king who is noted by this marke of a notorious harlot that shee painted her face for what is this but to finde fault with god owne workemanship and to seeke to correct the same by a counterfait worke of our owne deuising which cannot but be highly displeasing vnto him a cunning painter when he hath once finished his worke if any man shall goe about to correct the same he is greatly offended much more then may god the most wise and absolute former and creatour of his workes be highly offended with all those that cannot content themselues with the fauour and feature they haue receiued from him but will needes be calling his worke into question and refining it according to their owne humour and fancies tertullian in his booke de habitu mulieru calls such persons and that deseruedly the deuills handmaides but may some say if there be any deformitie in the bodie may we not labour to couer it ans yes but we may not set any new forme on the face or habite on the bodie dissembling is condemned as well in deede as in word and such is this secondly we must place the principall ornament of our soules and body in vertue and good workes and not in any outward things so would paul haue woomen to aray theselues in comely apparell with shamefastnes and modestie tim thirdly in vsing of ornaments beforenamed we must be very sparing and keepe our selues within the meane gen abrahams servant gaue rebecca an abillement of halfe a shekel weight and two bracelets of ten shekels of gold which shee put vpon her forehead and hands v all which were of no great value and therefore not excessiue but comely and moderate and in the old testament kings daughters were clad but in parti coloured garments sam there was therefore euen amongst them great plainenesse it will here be demanded what is then the measure that must be vsed ans the scripture giues no rule for our direction in this point but the example and iudgement of the sagest and soberest persons in euery order age and condition and as they doe and iudge so must we as for example whether a man should weare a ruffe single or double or tripled ampc the scripture in particular giues no direction onely we must looke vpon the example of the soberest and discreetest persons of our order and age and that ought to be our president for imitation fourthly ornaments must be vsed not alwaies alike but according to times and seasons it is noted as a fault in the rich glutton that he went euery day in costly apparell luke in the daies of reioycing we may put on more outward ornaments and so they vsed of ancient times at mariages to put on wedding garments matth but in the daies of mourning baser and courser attire is to be vsed as fittest for the time fiftly we must adorne our body to a right ende to wit that thereby we may honour them and in them honour god against this rule do offend those that adorne their body to be praised to be counted rich and great persons and to purchase and procure vnto themselues the loue of straungers this is the harlots practise described by salomon at large prou amp these are the endes for which we must attire our selues and so much of the first maine rule to be obserued in the wearing and putting on of apparell the second maine rule followeth we must make a spirituall vse of the apparell which we weare how may that be done ans first we must take occasion thereby to humble our selues and that in this manner when we see the plaister vpon the sore we know there is a wound and so the couer of our body must put vs in minde of our shame and nakednes in regard of grace and god fauour by reason of originall sinne and we are to know that it is a dangerous practise for any man to puffe vp himselfe in pride vpon the sight and vse of his apparell for this is to be proud of his owne shame nay it is as much as if a theese should be proud of his bolts and of the halter about his necke garments beeing nothing els but the couer of our shame and the signes of our sinnes secondly by the putting on of our garments we must be admonished to put on christ rom quest how shall wee doe that ans thus we must conceiue christs obedience actiue and passiue as a couering and therefore by praier we are to come vnto god in his name and intreat him to accept this his obedience for vs yes that christ may be made vnto vs wisdome righteousnes sanctification and redemption and we on the other side made conformable to him in life and death in all morall duties lastly that we may haue the same mind affection and conuersation that he had thirdly when we put off our cloth we then are admonished of putting off the olde man that is the masse and body of sinnefull corruption and we then put him off when we can by grace hate sinne and carrie a resolute purpose in our hearts of not sinning fourthly when we cloth our selues and trusse our attire to our body this should teach vs a further thing that it behooueth vs to gird vp our loines to haue our lightes burning to prepare our selues to meete christ whether by death or by the last iudgment if we make not these vses of our attire we doe not rightly vse but rather abuse the same in a word to shut vp this point we are all to be exhorted to make conscience of the practise of these rules and to take heede of pride in these outward things and in way of motiue hereunto consider first how great amp hainous a sinne pride is the greatnes of it may be discerned by foure things first in it and the fruit thereof superfluity of apparell there is an abuse of our wealth to needlesse and superfluous vses which ought to be employed to vses more necessarie as to the good of the church common wealth and familie and especially for the releife of the poore secondly in this sinne there is an abuse of time for they that giue themselues to pride spend so much time in the adorning of their body that they haue no leisure for the adorning and beautifying of the soule hence it comes to passe that proud persons abound with ignorance idlenesse wantonnesse and many other enormities thirdly in this sinne there is an abuse of the attire it selfe in that it is made a signe of the vanitie of the mind and wantonnesse of the heart which should be the signe of a heart religiously disposed fourthly in it there is a confusion of order in the estates amp societies of man for whereas one order of man should goe thus attired and another after another manner by this it comes to passe that equall and superior are clothed both alike and that which should be an occasion to humble vs is made an occasion to puffe vs vp fiftly there is a great iudgement threatned against this sinne esay zeph the greatnes of this vice we are to endeavour by all means possible to redresse in our selues for which purpose we must be careful to see and feele and withall to bewaile the spirituall nakednes of our soules which is a deprauation of the image of god wherein we are created according to him in holines and righteousnesse the want whereof makes vs vgly and deformed in the eyes of god and the true sense and experience of this will turne our mindes and thoughts from the trimming of the body and make vs especially to labour for the righteousnesse of christ imputed as the onely couering which will keepe vs warme amp safe from the stormes and tempests of the wrath and furie of god in the fourth place we come to the handling of those questions that concerne the moderation of our appetite in the vse of pleasures and recreations and these are specially three ans yes and that for two causes first rest from labour with the refreshing of bodie and mind is necessarie because mans nature is like the bow which being alway bent and vsed is soone broken in pieces now that which is necessarie is lawful and if rest be lawful then is recreation also lawful secondly by christian libertie we are allowed to vse the creatures of god not onely for our necessitie but also for meete and convenient delight this is a confessed truth and therefore to them which shall condemne fit and conuenient recreation as some of the ancient fathers haue done by name chrysostom and ambrose it may be said be not to righteous be not to wise eccl ans i will first lay downe this ground that all lawful recreation is onely in the vse of things indifferent which are in themselues neither commanded nor forbidden for by christia libertie the vse of such things for lawful delight and pleasure is permitted vnto vs therfore meete and fitt recreations doe stand in the vse of things indifferent and not in things either commanded or forbidden hence i deriue three conclusions that may serue for the better answer of the question i recreation may not be in the vse of holy things that is in the vse of the word sacraments praier or in any act of religion for these things are sacred amp divine they doe stad by god expresse comandement amp may not be applyed to any common or vulgar vse for this cause it is well provided that the pageants which haue beene vsed in sundrie cities of this land are put downe because they were nothing els but either the whole or part of the historie of the bible turned into a play and therefore the lesse to be allowed considering that the more holy the matter is which they represent the more vnholy are the plaies themselues againe all such iests as are framed out of the phrases amp sentences of the scripture are abuses of holy things and therefore carefully to be avoided the common saying may teach vs thus much non est bonum ludere cum sanctis it is no safe course to play with holy things lastly vpon the former conclusion we are taught that it is not meete conuenient or laudable for man to mooue occasion of laughter in sermons the second coclusion recreation may not be made of the sinns or offences of man they ought to be vnto vs the matter of sorrow amp mourning dauid shed river of tears because man brake the commandements of god psalm the righteous heart of lot was vexed with hearing the abominations of sodome pet vpon this it followeth first that common plaies which are in vse in the world are to be reprooued as beeing not meet and conuenient matter of recreation for they are nothing els but representations of the vices amp misdemeanou s of man in the world now such representations are not to be approoved paul saith fornication couetousnes let them not be named among you as becommeth saintes ephesians and if vices of man may not be named vnlesse the naming of them tend to the reproouing amp further condemning of them much lesse may they be represented for the causing of mirth and pastime for naming is farre lesse then representing which is the reall acting of the vice indeed magistrates amp ministers may name them but their naming must be to punish and reforme them not otherwise againe it is vnseemely that a man should put on the person behauiour and habite of a woman as it is also for a woman to put on the person behauiour and habite of a man though it be but for an houre the law of god forbiddes both deut and that law for equitie is not meerely iudiciall but morall nay it is the law of nature and common honesty here also the dauncing vsed in these daies is to be reprooued namely the mixed dauncing of man and weomen in number amp measure specially after solemne feasts with many lascivious gestures accompanying the same which cannot nor ought to be iustified but condemned for it is no better then the very bellowes of lust and vncleanes yes the cause of much euill it is condemned in the daughter of herodias dauncing before herod mark and in the israelites that sat downe to eat and drinke and rose vp to play that is to daunce we read indeed of a kind of dauncing commended in scripture that moses aaron and miriam vsed at the redde sea exod and david before the arke sam and the daughters of israel when dauid gotte the victorie of goliah sam but this dauncing was of another kind for it was not mixt but single man together and woman apart by themselues they vsed not in their dauncing wanton gestures and amorous songs but the psalmes of praise and thanksgiuing the cause of their dauncing was spirituall ioy and the end of it was praise and thanksgiuing it may be alleadged that ecclesiastes saith there is a time of mourning and a time of dauncing eccl and dauid saith thou hast turned my ioy into dauncing psalm and the lord saith in ieremie o daughter sion thou shalt got forth with the daunce of them that reioyce ier i answer first these places speake of the sacred dauncing before named and not of the dauncing of our times secondly i say that these places speake not of dauncing properly but of reioycing signified by dauncing that is to say a heartie reioycing or merrie making besides that the prophet ieremie speaks by way of comparison as if he should say then shall the virgin reioyce as man are woont to doe in the duin and it is sometimes the vse of the scripture to expresse things lawful by a comparison drawne from things unlawful as in the parables of the vnrighteous iudge the vniust steward and the theefe in the night the third conclusion we may not make recreations of god iudgements or of the punishments of sinne the law of god forbiddes vs to lay a stumbling blocke before the blind to cause him to fall though it be not done in earnest but in sport leuit vpon the same ground we are not to sport our selues with the follie of the naturall foole for that is the blindnes of his minde and the iudgement of god vpon him i know it hath beene the vse of great man to keepe fooles in their houses and i dare not condemne the fact for they may doe it to set before their cies a daily spectacle of god iudgement and to consider how god in like sort might haue dealt with them and this vse is christian neuerthelesse to place a speciall recreation in the follie of such persons and to keepe them onely for this ende it is not laudable when dauid fained himselfe to be madde before achish the king of gath marke what the heathen king could say haue i neede of madde man that ye haue brought this fellow to play the madde man in my presence shall he come into my house sam againe the bayting of the beare and cockefights are no meete recreations the baiting of the bull hath his vse and therefore it is commanded by ciuill authoritie and so haue not these and the antipathie and crueltie which one beast sheweth to another is the fruit of our rebellion against god and should rather mooue vs to mourne then to reioyce the second answer to the former question is this games may be deuided into three sorts games of wit or industry games of hazard and a mixture of both games of wit or industrie are such as are ordered by the skil and industry of man of this sort are shooting in the long bow shooting in the caleeuer running wrastling fensing musicke the games of chests and draughts the philosophers game and such like these and all of this kind wherein the industry of the mind amp body hath the chiefest stroke are very commendable and not to be disliked games of hazard are those in which hazard onely beares the sway and orders the game and not witte wherein also there is as we say chance yes meere chance in regard of vs of this kind is dicing and sundry games at the tables amp cardes now games that are of meere hazard by the consent of godly divines are unlawful the reasons are these first games of meere hazard are indeede lo s and the vse of a lot is an act of religio in which we referre vnto god the determination of things of moment that can no other way be determined for in the vse of a lotte there be foure things the first is a casuall act done by vs as the casting of the die the second is the applying of this acte to the determination of some particular controversie the ending whereof maintaines peace order and loue among man the third is confession that god is a soueraigne iudge to end and determine things that can no other way be determined the fourth is supplication that go would by the disposition of the lotte when it is cast determine the euent all these actions are infolded in the vse of a lotte and they are expressed act ver now then seeing the vse of a lotte is a solemne act of religio it may not be applied to sporting as i haue shewed in the first conclusion secondly such games are not recreations but rather matter of stirring vp troblesome passions as feare sorrow ampc and so they distemper the body and mind thirdly covetousnes is commonly the ground of them all wherevpon it is that man vsually play for money and for these causes such plaies by the consent of learned divines are unlawful the third kind of plaies are mixt which stand partly of hazard and partly of witte amp in which hazard beginnes the game and skil gets the victorie and that which is defectiue by reason of hazard is corrected by witte to this kind are referred some games at the cards and tables now the common opinion of learned divines is that as they are not to be comended so they are not simply to be condemned and if they be vsed they must be vsed very sparingly yet there be others that hold these mixt games to be unlawful and iudge the very dealing of the cards to be a lotte because it is a meere casuall action but as i take it the bare dealing of the cards is no more a lotte then the dealing of an almes when the princes almner puts his hand into his pocket and giues for example to one man sixe pence to another twelue pence to another two pence what comes forth without any choice now this casuall distribution is not a lot but onely a casuall action and in a lot there must be two things the first is a casuall act the second the applying of the foresaid act to the determination of some particular and vncertaine euent now the dealing of the cards is a casuall act but the determination of the vncertaine victorie is not from the dealing of the cardes in mixed games but from the wit and skill at least from the will of the players but in things that are of the nature of a lot the wit and will of man hath no stroke at all neuerthelesse though the dealing of the cardes and mixed games be no lots yet it is farre saffer and better to abstaine from them then to vse them and where they are abolished they are not to be restored againe because in common experience many abuses and inconueniences attend vpon them and things vnnecessarie when they are much abused because they are abused they must not be vsed but rather remooued as the brasen serpent was king for answer whereof we must remember these foure speciall rules i rule we are to make choice of recreations that are of least offence and of the best report philipp whatsoeuer things are of good report thinke of them the reason is because in all recreations we must take heede of occasions of sinne both in our selues and others and this mooued iob while his sonnes were a feasting to offer daily burnt offerings according to the number of them all because he thought it may be my sonnes haue sinned and blasphemed god in their hearts iob and not onely that but i adde further we must take heede of occasions of offence in others vpon this ground paul saies that rather then his eating should offend his brother he would eate no meate while the world indured corinthian in this regard it were to be wished that games of wit should be vsed onely and not games of hazard because they are more scandalous then the other lastly in things that are lawful in themselues we are to remember paules rule all things are lawful but all things are not expedient corinthian ii rule our recreations must be profitable to our selues and others and they must tend also to the glorie of god our sauiour christ saies that of euery idle word that man shall speake they shall giue an account at the day of iudgement matth where by idle words he meaneth such as bring no profit to man nor honour to god and if for idle words then also for idle recreations must we be accountable to him againe s paul teacheth that whether we eate or drinke or whatsoeuer we doe we must doe all to the glorie of god corinthian therefore the scope and ende of all recreations is that god may be honoured in and by them iii rule the ende of our recreation must be to refresh our body and mindes it is then an abuse of recreation when it is vsed to winne other mens money the gaine that comes that way is worse then vsurie yes it is flat theft for by the law we may recouer things stolne but there is no law to recouer things wonne and yet if play be for a small matter the losse whereof is no hurt to him that looseth it and if it be applied to a common good it is lawful otherwise not iv rule recreation must be moderate and sparing euen as the vse of meat and drinke and rest whence it followeth that they which spende their whole life in gaming as players doe haue much to answer for and the like is to be saide of them that haue lands and possessions and spend their time in pleasures and sports as is the fashion of many gentlemen in these daies now recreation must be sparing two waies first in regard of time for we must redeeme the time that is take time while time lasteth for the procuring of life euerlasting ephesians this condemneth the wicked practise of many man that follow this game and that to driue away time wheras they should employ all the time that they can to doe god will and indeede it is all to little to doe that which we are commanded and therfore while it is called to day let vs make all the hast we can to repent and be reconciled vnto god secondly recreation must be sparing in regard of our affection for we may not set our hearts vpon sports but our affection must be tempered and alaied with the feare of god thus salomon saies that laughter is madnes ecclesiastes so farre forth as it hath not the feare and reuerence of the name of god to restraine it this was the sinne of the iewes reprooued by the prophet that they gaue themselues to all manner of pleasure and did not consider the worke of the lord that is his iudgements and corrections isaiah and thus if sports and recreations be not ordered and guided according to this and the other rules we shall make them all not onely vnprofitable vnto vs but vtterly unlawful and so much of the vertue of temperance of liberalitie hitherto we haue treated of the first sort of vertues that are seated in the will which doe respect a mans owne selfe namely of clemencie which standeth in the moderation of the mind in respect of anger and temperance which consisteth in the moderation of our appetite in respect of riches apparell meate and drinke pleasures and recreations now we come to the second sort which respect others beside our sel es and these belong to the practise either of courtesie and kindnes or equitie and right of the first kind is liberalltie of the second is iustice in shewing or giuing equitie or fortitude in maintaining the same of these in order liberalitie is a vertue seated in the will whereby we shew or practise courtesie and kindnes to others the principall questions touching this vertue may be referred to that text of scripture which is written luke therefore giue almes of those things which ye haue and behold all things shall be cleane vnto you the words are a rule or counsell deliuered by christ to the pharisies and the true and proper sense of them is this you pharisies giue your selues to the practise of iniustice and oppression and thereby you desile your selues and all your actions for redresse hereof i propound you this rule practise charitie in giuing of your almes let your outward good actions proceede from the inward syncere affection of your hearts towards your brother and then shall you attaine to a holy and pure vse of your goods the counsell of daniel to king nebuchadnezar daniel to breake off his sinnes by the practise of iustice and his iniquities by mercie to the afflicted may be a good commentarie to this text in the words i consider two things a remedie therefore giue almes of those things you haue and the fruit that followes vpon the remedie and behold all things shall be cleane vnto you the remedie is the vertue of christian liberalitie consisting principally in the practise of loue and mercie in giuing of almes for the better vnderstanding whereof fiue questions are briefly to be propounded and resolued ans there be two sorts of man that are and ought to be giuers of almes the first sort are rich man who besides things necessarie haue superfl tle and abundance yes much more then things necessarie these are such as haue the worlds good as s john saith whereby they are inabled to giue and bestow releefe vpon others out of their abundance thus saint paul saith that the abundance of the corinthians must supplie the want of other churches corinthian many other proofes might be brought but these are sufficient in a knowne and confessed truth a second sort of giuers are man of the poore sort that haue but things necessarie and sometime want them too and because this point is not so easily graunted therefore i will prooue it by the scriptures the man that liues by his work is commaded to labour in his calling that he may haue something to giue to them that want ph the poore widow that cast into the lord treasurie of her penurie but two mites that is the eight part of a pennie is commended and christ preserreth her almes before the great gifts of the richer sort luke the church of macedonia beeing poore and in extreame necessitie doth yet send reliefe to other churches and is commended for it by paul corinthian their povertie excused them not fro liberalitie but they were liberall not onely according to but even beyond their abilitie our sauiour christ himselfe liued of almes for ioanna the wife of chuza herods steward amp susana ministred vnto him of their substance luke where by the way we note that he did not liue by begging as the papists affirme but by the voluntarie ministration and contribution of some to whom he preached now though he was so poore himselfe yet he vsed to giue aimes of that he had ioh the oblations of the old testament for the maintenance of the altar were a matter of great cost and charge in sacrifices amp such like ceremonies amp yet al were charged with them the poore as well as the rich now in the new testament the materiall altar is taken away amp yet we haue something in the roome therof namely those that are poore and destitute which all man are bound in conscience to releeue and maintaine as once they were to maintaine the altar saint john commends vnto vs charitie not that which consisteth in words onely but which shewes it selfe in actions ioh teaching that the one is no way sufficient without the other lastly all mankind is distinguished into these two sorts some are givers some are receiuers of aimes there is not a third kind to be found in the scriptures yet here an exception must be added that this doctrine be not mistake there are some persons exempted from this dutie amp they be such as are in subiection to others and are not at their owne disposition of this sort are children vnder the gouernement of their parents and servant subiect to the authoritie and dominion of their masters for the goods which they haue are not their owne neither may they dispose of them as they list they therefore must not be giuers it may be asked whether the wife may giue almes without the consent of her husband considering that she is in subiection to another and therfore all that she hath is anothers amp not her own ans the wife may giue almes of some things but with these cautios as first she may giue of those ex paraphernalibus goods that she hath excepted from marriage secondly she may giue of those things which are commo to them both provided it be with her husbands consent at least generall and implicite thirdly she may not giue without or against the consent of her husband and the reason is because both the law of nature and the word of god commands her obedience to her husband in all things if it be alleadged that ioanna the wife of chuza herodes steward with others did minister to christ of their goods luke i answer it is to be presumed that it was not done without all consent againe if it be said that abigail brought a present to dauid for the releife of him and his young man whereof she made not nabal her husband acquainted sam i answer it is true but marke the reason nabal was generally of a churlish and vnmercifull disposition wherevpon he was altogether vnwilling to yeeld releife to any in howe great necessitie soeuer whence it was that he ailed on the young man that came to him and dro e them away ver againe he was a foolish man and giuen to drunkennesse so as he was not fitte to gouerne his house or to dispense his almes besides that abigail was a woman of great wisedome in all her actions and that which she now did was to saue nabals and her owne life yes the liues of his whole family for the case was desperate and all that they had were in present hazard that example therefore is no warrant for any woman to giue almes vnlesse it be in the like case ans to them that are in neede ephesians for the better conceiving of this answer we must remember that there be three degrees of need the first is extreame necessitie when a man is vtterly destitute of the meanes of preseruation of life the second is great need when a man hath very little to maintaine himselfe and his the third is common necessitie when he hath something but yet not sufficient or competent now those that are in the first and second degree of neede they are the persons that must be s coured and releeued for proofe hereof consider these places mat i was hungry and ye gaue me meat i thirsted amp ye gaue m drinke i was naked and ye clothed mee i was sicke and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me where obserue what person christ commendeth vnto vs to be releeued the hungry thirstie naked sicke harbourles and the capt ue or prisoner rom if thine enemie hunger feede him if the thirst giue him drinke we must not onely supply the need of our freindes but also our enemy tim if any beleeuing man or woman haue widowes let him minister vnto them ampc that there may be sufficient for them that are widowes indeede here widowes that are desolate without friends and goods are commended to the liberalitie of the church leuit if thy brother be impouerished and hath the trembling hand thou shalt releeue him as a stranger or soiourner so shall he liue with thee by the trembling hand is meant the man that workes hard for his liuing and yet cannot by his labour get things necessarie but must needes stretch out his hand to others that are in better state for helpe here two questions may further be made first whether we must giue almes to beggers i meane such as goe from doore to doore for they come vnder the degrees of needie persons ans beggars are of two sorts either such as are strong able to labour and doe somewhat for their liuing or such as are weake and impotent vnable to take paines for the maintenance of themselues or those that belong vnto them the first sort are not to be reiceued for touching them the apostle hath giuen this rule he that will not labour must not eate thess euery man must liue by the labour of his owne hands and feede vpon his owne bread againe such beggers are theeues amp robbers because they steale their labour from the church and commonwealth which is as profitable as land and treasure in the old law if two man striued together and the one had wounded the other the offender was inioyned not onely to pay for the healing but for the losse of his time also exod and in like manner ought such persons to beare the punishment both of their theft and of the losse of their labour and the truth is they that giue to them in this their loose life doe maintaine them in wickednes yet here one caution is to be remembred that if such a man be in extreame neede he must be helped rather then he should perish and the magistrate is to punish him for his idlenes and to compell him to labour the magistrate i say for priuate persons haue no authoritie to inflict punishment in this case as for the other sort that are vnable to worke they are not allowed by the word of god to gather their almes themselues by begging from doore to doore but to be releeued at home in their houses deut there shall not be a begger in thee v there shall be euer some poore in the land here the holy ghost makes a plaine difference between the poore and the begger forbidding the one and commanding to helpe the other saint paul likewise distinguisheth of widowes whereof some haue rich kindred and they are to be prouided for by them tim others are destitute of friends and kindred by whome they may be releeued and such he willeth to be maintained by the church v and this is no toleration or approbation of beggers againe the begging of almes is the very seminarie of vagabonds rogues amp stragling p sos which haue no calling nor are of any corporation church or commonwealth yes it doth proclaime to the world in the eares of all man the shame either of the magistrate who restraines it not hauing authoritie or of the wealthie and able that they haue no mercy or compassion it is also a great disorder in commonwealths for the boldest and most clamarous begger carries away all the almes from the rest and so releefe is distributed both vnwisely and vnequally and howsoeuer it is the good law of our land agreeable to the law of god that none should begge that are able to labour and all man are bound in conscience to see it obserued that haue any care of the good of this church and commonwealth yet it is a plague of our times and greatly to be bewailed that it is neglected and not put i execution in the second place it is demanded whether we must put a difference betweene persons and persons in giuing our almes ans there be three differences of man that are in neede the first is a mans owne and such are they that be of his houshold for which he that makes not provision is worse then an infidell as the apostle speaketh tim those also which are of a mans own blood as father and mother ampc mat now contrarie to this sort are strangers to whome we must not giue for to neglect a mans own and to bestowe it vpon forrainers vnlesse there be iust and necessarie cause so to doe is a sinne against the law of nature a second difference of man is this some are of the houshold of faith saint pauls rule is this that we preferre them before the other gal doe good vnto all man but specially to them that are of the houshold of faith a third difference some are our owne poore of our towne land amp country amp some be strangers in the same respects now howsoeuer we are debters to all that we can doe good to yet those that are neerer to vs in habitation or neighbourhood are to be respected and releeued before others this the lord commandeth deu if one of thy brother with thee be poore within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giueth thee thou shalt not harden thy hart and shut thine hand from him and these beeing releeued we may in the next place afford our helpe to others thus did the good samaritane in case of necessitie practize his charitie vpon a stranger luke and is therefore commended by our sauiour christ ans we must put a difference betweene the almes of priuate man and of incorporations or churches touching priuate mens almes the scripture hath not determined how much must be giuen but hath left it to the discreet consideration of euery christian and yet it must be remembred which the apostle saith that he that soweth sparingly shal reape sparingly and againe let euery man giue as he hath determined in his owne heart lastly he giues a commandement touching the quantitie of giuing that euery first day of the weeke euery one lay aside by himselfe and lay vp as god hath prospered him that is according to the abilitie wherewith god hath blessed him corinthian but two cautions are proprounded in the word touching this quantitie first that we must not so giue almes that others be ased and we our selues grieued corinthian it is not god will that we should giue all that we haue in almes and keepe nothing for our selues but that we keepe a due proportion in giuing and doe that good to others whereby we may not our selues be hindred or oppressed our foutaines and river must runne to serue the necessitie of the stranger in vse prov but yet the right must remaine our owne we may not giue away fountaine and water and all luke he that hath two coates let him part with him that hath none that is he that hath things necessarie and in abundance let him giue freely yet so as he reserue one coate to himselfe here the papist is iustly to be blamed who holdeth it a state of perfection to giue away all and to liue by begging for this can not be seeing it is against god commandement who will haue some giuen and not all one coate not both and so is a state rather of sinne and imperfection secondly in the case of extreame necessitie and not otherwise we must enable our selues to giue almes though it be by the selling of our possessions luke sel that ye haue and giue almes our sauiours meaning is in the case of extreame necessitie when there is no other way to releeue those that are to be releeued dauid notes it as a propertie of a mercifull man that he disperseth abroad and giues to the poore psalm it was practised by the primitiue church in the times of persecution in the like case act and the church of macedonia though they were in want themselues yet supplied the extreame want of other churches corinthian now touching the almes of whole body and churches this is the rule that they should maintaine the poore with things necessarie fit and conuenient as meate drinke and cloathing tim and this serues to con ute a grosse errour maintained by learned papists who hold that whatsoeuer a man hath aboue that which is necessarie to nature and estate he should giue it in almes but the truth is otherwise for a man may and ought to giue almes more liberally when he hath abundance yet so as he is not bound to giue all but may reserue euen part of his superfluitie for the publicke vse of church and common wealth and to this purpose is that which our sauiour saith luke he that hath two coates that is things necessarie and superfluous must giue but one and that in the case of the greatest necessitie meaning thereby that all superfluitie must not be giuen in almes sauing onely in the case aforesaid of extreame want ans three waies first by free giuing to the poore secondly by free lending for this is oftentimes as beneficiall to a man as giuing for this ende there was a law giuen deut thou shalt open thy hand vnto thy poore brother and lend him sufficient for his neede which he hath luke lend looking for nothing againe exod if thou lend money to the poore with thee thou shalt not be an vsurer vnto him thou shall not oppresse him with vsurie thirdly by remitting due debt in case of mens decay and extreame pouertie exod if thou take thy neighbours rayment to pledge thou shalt restore it vnto him before the sun goe downe for that is his couering onely and this is his garment for his skin wherein shal he sleepe therefore when he crieth vnto me for colde and necessitie i will heare him for i am mercifull according to this law nehemiah exhorteth the rulers and princes of the iewes that had oppressed their poore countrey man saying ren it vnto them the hundreth part of the siluer and of the corne of the wine and of the oyle that ye exact of them for loane nehem ans for the right manner of giuing sundry things are required but specially these sixe first a man must consecrate himselfe and all the gifts that he hath amp enioyeth to god and his honour this dutie is commended in the church of macedonia that they gaue their owne selues first to the lord and after vnto them that were in neede by the will of god corinthian and thus the prophet esay foretelleth that the citie tyrus being conuerted should consecrate themselues and their goods to the lord isaiah yet her occupying and her wages shall be holy vnto the lord it shal not be laid vp nor kept in store but her marchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord to eate sufficiently and to haue durable cloathing secondly we must giues almes in faith how is that first we must be perswaded that we are reconciled to god in christ and stand in his fauour and then our almes shall be accepted for no worke of the person can please god before the person himselfe be approoued of him secondly we must depend vpon god by faith for the good successe of our almes saint paul compares the poore man to a field well tilled and almes to the sowing of seede which hath a most plentifull haruest of blessing following it corinthian now as the husbandma casting his seed into the earth waiteth vpon god for the fruit thereof iam so must the good man that giues almes depend vpon god for the euent thereof salomon saies he that hath mercy vpon the poore lendeth to the lord and the lord will recompence him that which he hath giuen prou vpon these grouds must our faith rest when we doe good to the poore thirdly we must giue in simplicitie rom he that distributeth let him doe it with simplicitie that is of meere pity and compassion and not for any sinister respect pleasure or praise of man mat when thou dost thine almes let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth fourthly we must giue in loue corinthian though i feede the poore with all my good ampc and haue not loue it profiteth me nothing fiftly in iustice for we must not giue other mens goods but our owne truly gotten isaiah the true fasting is to breake thine owne bread to the hungrie to bring the poore that wander into thine owne house ampc sixtly with a bountifull and chearefull minde corinthian as euery man wisheth in his heart so let him giue not grudgingly or of necessitie for god loueth a chearefull giuer our almes must not be extorted but franke amp free and hence it followeth that there ought to be no begging from doore to doore in a christian commonwealth for that shewes that man part with their almes of a niggardly and compelled minde and thus much of the remedie in the next place followeth the fruit of the remedie in these words and all things shall be cleane vnto you here first i will speake of the false and then of the true and right fruit of liberalitie the false fruit is this that giuing of almes doth merit forgiuenes of sinne and satisfie the iustice of god for the temporall punishment thereof that we may the better see the errour of this doctrine i will answer their arguments obiect i first they alleadge out of this text that giuing of almes makes all things cleane vnto vs ans we must vnderstand the text thus if we turne to god beleeue in christ and leaue all our sinnes then are we cleane and all our actions and consequently our almesgiuing shall be cleane vnto vs for to the pure all things are pure now almes and other things are then said to be cleane vnto a man when he beeing himselfe pure maketh and hath a pure vse of them obiect ii daniel redeeme thy sinnes by giuing of al ans this place maketh against the papists for by sinnes the prophet vnderstandeth both the guilt amp also the punishment whereas they affirme that the guilt of sinne cannot be redeemed but by christ alone and man onely is to satisfie for the temporall punishment of sinne secondly the word which they translate redeeme doth properly signifie as it is in the chalde paraphrase to breake off as if the prophet should haue said thou article o king a mightie monarch and thou hast vsed much iniustice and crueltie therefore now repent thy selfe and breake off the course of thy sinnes and testifie thy repentance by doing iustice and giuing almes to the poore whom thou hast oppressed thirdly the word in the ancient latine translations signifieth to amende and then it beareth this sense amend thy selfe and the course of thy life and let thine iniustice be turned into iustice thy crueltie into mercie obiect iii make you friends with the riches of iniquitie that when ye shall want they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations luke ans receiuing here mentioned is not by way of merit as though a man could deserue it by giuing almes but either by way of heartie praiers made by the poore that they may be receiued or els because their almes shall be vnto them a pledge and earnest of their receiuing into god kingdome obiect iv prou by mercie and truth iniquitie is redeemed ans salomons meaning is that by god goodnes and not ours iniquity is pardoned if by mercie is meant mans mercie then are we to vnderstand it thus that mercie and truth are euident signes vnto vs that our sinnes are forgiuen and not the working causes of remission obiect v luke and thou which giuest releefe shalt be blessed because they can not recompense thee therefore almes doe merit ans when god promiseth reward to the giuing of almes the promise is not made to the worke but to the worker and that not for the merit of his person or worke but onely for christ his sake in whome he is by whose meanes he stands reconciled vnto god and so man that practise charitie in giuing of almes are rewarded with blessednes not for their almes but according to the mercie of god in christ now followeth the right fruit of almesgiuing and it stands in foure things first they are the way in which we must walke to life euerlasting i say the way not the cause either of life or any other good thing that god hath promised secondly they are effects and fruits of our faith yes the signes and seales of god mercie to vs in christ to this purpose s paul wisheth timothie tim to charge them that be rich in this world that they doe good and be rich in good workes and be readie to distribute laying vp in store for themselues a good foundation against the time to come that they may obtaine eternall life now where is this foundation to be laide vp not in heauen for that is impossible for vs and it is laide vp for vs there alreadie by christ but in our owne consciences and that is our assurance of god fauour in this world and life euerlasting in the world to come of which assurance this and other good works are signes and seales vnto vs thirdly almes comes in the way of restitution of those goods that haue beene gotten fraudulently though from whome we know not thus zacheus at his conuersion for wrongs that he had done he knew not to whome gaue halfe his goods to the poore and proclaimed restitution to those that could come forth and chalenge him lastly aimes are a notable remedie against couetousnesse for he that hath a mercifull heart to bestow vpon the poore shall easily be content with that he hath and auoid that sinne whereby otherwise he falls into tentations and snares of the deuill tim of iustice the substance of the whole psalme is a question and an answer the question is who are the members of god church vpon earth that shall come to life eternall in heaue ver the answer is made in the rest of the psalme and in this answer is contained a description of the parties by their properties and markes the first marke is walking vprightly that is in truth and sinceritie of religion which standeth in the sinceritie of faith and a good conscience the second note is the practise of righteousnes now righteousnes or iustice is twofold the iustice of the gospel and the iustice of the law evangelical iustice is that which the gospell reveales and not the law to witte the obedience of christ in his sufferings and fulfilling of the law imputed to them that beleeue for their iustification and this is not here meant legall iustice is that which the law revealeth and withall requireth and it is either vniuersall or particular vniuersall iustice is the practise of all vertues or that whereby a man obserues all the commandements of the law of this paul speaketh rom in which place he opposeth it to the righteousnes which is by faith and zachary and elizabeth are said to be iust before god luke namely by this vniuersall iustice because they walked in all the commandements and ordinances of the lord indeauouring in althings to please him particular iustice is that whereby we giue to euery man his right or due and of this dauid here speaketh the reason is because if it were not so then this second marke should comprehend vnder it all the rest and so there would be no good distinction of these properties one from the other particular iustice is two fold in distribution or in exchange and contract iustice in distribution is that which keepes a proportion in giuing to euery man that honour dignitie reuerence reward or punishment that is due vnto him of this there are mooued principally two questions ans iudgement is of two sorts publicke and priuate publicke which is giuen and administred by a publicke person in a publicke place such is the iudgement of the magistrate when he acquitteth or condemneth man as their deserts are to temporal punishment of which we may read cron psalm such also is the iudgement of the prophet or minister whereby he doth openly pronouce to me that beleeue amp repent that their sinnes are remitted or retained corinthian or that whereby he delivereth obstinate sinners vp vnto satan by the censure of excommunication or suspension corinthian priuate iudgement is that whereby one man giues iudgement privately of another and touching it we are to consider two points first of what things iudgement must be giuen secondly how we are to giue iudgement for the first we must giue iudgement of three sorts of things of mens facts of their doctrines and of their persons touching facts the apostle paul would not haue vs to haue fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes ephesians but rather to reprooue them because they are subiect to our iudgement and being reprooued by vs they are iudged of vs and our sauiour doth therefore command vs when our brother trespasseth against vs to goe and reprooue him because his actions are liable to our censure secondly the doctrines of man are to be iudged by vs try the spirits whether they are of god or no ioh the spirituall man iudgeth all things that is all doctrines corinthian and our sauiour saith you shall know them by their fruits that is partly by their doctrine amp partly by their liues being iudged according to the rule of god word mat thirdly we may iudge of the persons of man now man are of two sorts either in the church or out of the church the members of the church must be iudged by the iudgement of charitie not of infallibility they that are out of the church we must suspend our iudgements concerning them and leaue it to god for what haue i doe saith the apostle to iudge those that are without corinthian we may try and examine the person but we must reserue the iudgement of condemnation to god alone the second point is how we are to iudge one of another ans the right manner of iudging according to the word of god i will lay downe in sixe rules the first is if we know any good thing by any man whether vertue or action we are willingly to speake of it to commend it and glorifie god name in it and for it thus paul affirmeth that the churches of iudaea when they heard the word which he preached glorified god for him gal the second rule if we know any euill sinne vice or offence by any man there is a time when we may and a time when we may not speake of it and that with good conscience for the better keeping of this rule foure cautions are to be remembred first he that will giue sentence of another man must in the first place purg and reforme himselfe to this purpose christ commandeth first to plucke the beame out of our owne eie and then shal we see clearely to cast out the more out of our brothers eie matth and he that will not doe this in iudgeing another he condemneth himselfe rom secondly we must be rightly and truly informed in the matter before we giue iudgement this was god owne practize who came downe to see whether the sinne of sodome was answerable to the crie gen thirdly our loue and charitie must order and direct both our speech and our iudgement of others that we speake not of them without deliberation for he that vpon hatred reports the euill he knoweth by another is a backebiter when doeg the edomite came amp shewed saul that dauid was gone to the house of abimelech he tolde no more then the truth and yet because it proceeded from an euill minde therefore dauid accuseth him of hatred backebiting slaundering and vnrighteousnes psalm fourthly he that speakes the euill he knowes by his neighbour must haue the testimonie of his owne conscience to assure him that he hath a calling to doe it now a man is called by god in three cases first when he is commanded by the magistrate to testifie what he knoweth secondly when an euill that is in his neighbour is to be redressed by admonition thirdly when an euill is to be preuented that it spread not abroad to the infection of others these caueats obserued we may speake the euill we know by others truly and with an vpright conscience but if they cannot be concealed rather then a man should blaze abroad the faults of others wherevnto he is privie he ought to be silent remembring alwaies the saying of salomon that it is the glory of a man to passe by an infirmitie and not to take notice therof but by loue to couer a multitude of sinnes prov the third rule when a mans speech or action is doubtfull and may be taken either well or ill we must alwaies interpet it in the better part when christ was brought before caiphas the high priest there came two witnesses against him who affirmed something of him which he had spoken but because they changed and misconstrued his words turning them to a wrong sense therfore they are called by the holy ghost to their perpetuall shame and reproch false witnesses mat againe the apostle saith that loue thinkes no euill corinthian therefore loue takes euery speech and action in the better sense the fourth rule touching secret offences of our neighbour we must suspend our iudgement of them the reason is because loue alwaies hopes the best and thinkes no euill corinthian and our sauiours rule is if thy brother trespasse against thee first reprooue him priuately betweene thee and him and goe no further if that will preuaile mat the fift rule against an elder receiue not an accusation vnder two or three witnesses tim by an elder vnderstand ministers civill gouernours and all superiours and if we must not receiue then much lesse may we frame an accusation against them this may be a lesson for all inferiours to learne who take libertie to themselues to speake what euill they please of their gouernours the sixt rule is concerning ministers the spirit of the prophets is subiect to the prophets and not to priuate persons corinthian indeede priuate persons haue power to examine and try their doctrine and ministry but they must goe no further for they haue no power to giue iudgement either of their ministers doctrin or persons the doctrine amp manners of teachers are subiect to the censure of prophets onely for example a priuate man saies that he may excommunicate at his pleasure those that sinne if he proceed according to the three degrees mentioned mat but this is in him a fault for he must not iudge in this case at his owne pleasure but his iudgement must follow the iudgement of the church and when the church hath giuen censure then may the priuate man proceede to censure and not before so saith our sauiour christ mat if he heare not the church after the church hath iudged him let him be vnto you as a heathen amp a publicane here if the question be made how a man may with good conscience giue iudgement of his owne selfe i answer by obseruing two rules first a man must alwaies in the presence of god iudge himself in regard of his sinnes both of hart amp life corinthian if we should iudge our selues we should not be iudged and this iudgement of a mans selfe must not be partiall but sharpe and seuere with true humiliation and lowlines of heart for this is a true ground of all charitable iudgement of others secondly before man a man must suppresse his iudgement of himselfe and be silent no man is bound either to praise or dispraise to excuse or accuse and condemne himselfe before others and grace must teach him thus much not vainely to commend or boast of of his owne gifts and actions but rather to burie them in silence and referre them to the iudgement of others now to conclude this point the doctrine deliuered is most necessarie for these times for the fashion of most man is to giue rash and sinister iudgement of others but themselues they will commend and that highly if any thing be euill saide or done all man must haue notice of it if a thing be doubtfull it is alway construed in the worser part if a thing be done of weaknes and infirmitie we aggrauate it and make it a double sinne we are curious in searching and inquiting into the liues of others that we may haue something to carpe and finde fault with but let this be remembred that as we iudge so we shall be iudged first of god by condemnation and then by hard and vnequal iudgement from others againe what is it that makes man to be open mouthed in declaring and censuring our faults but this that we open our mouthes to the disgrace and defamation of others wherefore if we would haue other man to iudge of vs and our actions in loue we must also make conscience to giue charitable iudgement of them ans that we may rightly honour man we must first know the causes for which man are to be honoured and that the causes of honour may be conceiued i will lay downe this ground honour is in the first place principally and properly to be giuen vnto god tim to god onely wise be honour and glorie the reason hereof is rendered in the lord prayer be cause his is kingdome power and glorie againe god is goodnes it selfe his goodnes and his essence are one and the same therefore honour is due to him in the first place now euery creature as it commeth neare vnto god so it is honourable and the more honourable by how much nearer it commeth vnto him but man especially by how much nearer he commeth to god in diuine things by so much more is he to be honoured in respect of other creatures from this ground doe follow these conclusions first that man is first of all to be honoured for vertues sake because therein principally standes the internall image of god rom to euery man that doth good shal be honour glorie amp peaece to the iew first ampc now whereas the question might be who is the iew to whome this honour must be yeelded paul answers verse that he is not a iew which is one outward but he is a iew who is one within and the circumcision is of the heart and salomon saith that honour is vnseemely for a foole prou and the holy ghost to the hebrewes saith that by faith our elders were well reported of the heathen man marcus marcellus a romane dedicated a teple to the goddesse of honour and the way to that temple was by the house of vertue the second conclusion is that man is to be honoured not onely for vertue but also for diuine representations of other good things in a word because one man before an other heareth the image of some thing that is in god as first of his maiestie thus the king is honoured because in his maiestie and state he carrieth a resemblance of the power and glorie of god so as that which is saide of god may be also spoken of him hence it was that daniel said to nebuchadnezar o king thou article a king of kings and why for the god of heauen hath giuen thee kingdome power strength and glorie daniel secondly of his dominion thus the husband is to be honoured of the wife because he beareth before the woman the image of the glorie of god yes of his prouidence wisedome lordship and gouernment corinthian thirdly of his paternitie and so the father is honoured of the son because he beares in his person the image of god paternitie or father hoode fourthly of his eternitie and hence it is that honour is giuen to the aged before the young man because he beareth the image thereof thus we see that diuine representations doe imprint a kinde of excellencie in some persons and consequently doe bring forth honour the third conclusion is that man are to be honoured euen for the vertues of others thus the sonnes of princes are called by the honourable name of princes the children of nobles are esteemed by birth noble thus dignities doe runne in discent and the posteritie is honoured in the name of the ancestours but principally for the vertues of the a ncestours the fourth conclusion is man are to be honoured for their riches i meane not for riches simply but for the right vse of riches namely as they are made instruments to vphold and maintaine vertue if it be said that to honour rich man is to haue the faith of the lord iesus christ in respect of persons iam i answer in that place we are not sorbidden to honour rich man but the apostles meaning is to reprooue a fault of an other kinde when man preferre riches before pietie when rich man are honoured beeing vngodly and when godly poore man are despised and reiected because they are poore now hauing premised the ground we come to giue answer to the question before propounded a man therefore is to honour euery one in his place whether he be his superiour equall or inferiour yes there is a kinde of honour to be performed to a mans owne selfe the truth of this answer we shall see in the particulars that follow touching the honouring of superiours these ruies are to be obserued first all superiours must haue reuerence done vnto them whether they be superiours in age in gifts in authoritie or howsoeuer and that because they are superiours the actions of reuerence due to all superiours are principally sixe the first is to rise vp before the superiour levit thou shalt rise vp before the boare head and honour the person of the old man the second when they are comming toward vs to goe and meete them thus when abraham saw the three angels comming toward him he ranne to meete them from the tent doore gen and king salomon when his mother bathsheha came towards him to speak vnto him for adoniah the text saith he rose vp to meete her king the third to bow the knee before the superiour thus wee read in the gospell that a certaine man comming to christ as he was going on the way kneeled vnto him mark thus abraham ranne to meete the three angels and bowed himselfe to the ground gen and the same abraham els where bowed himselfe before the people of the land of the hittites gen the fourth to giue them the first and highest seat or place this our sauiour christ meaneth in the parable wherein he willeth those who are invited to a banquet to yeeld the chiefest place to them that are more honourable then themselues luke and it is set downe as a commendation of iosephs brother that they sate before him in order the eldest according to his age amp the youngest according to his youth gen here we must remember that though in common practise among man the right hand is a note of superioritie yet in scripture the practise is contrarie for in the article of our creede sitting at the right hand signifieth the inferioritie of the mediator in respect of the father though it be a token of his superioritie in regard of the church and so must the place be vnderstood king where it is said that bathsheba sate at the right hand of salomon namely that it was an argument of superioritie whereunto he preferred her before the people but it shewed her infirmitie in regard of salomo himself and this custome is frequent both in the scriptures amp in humane writers the fift to giue libertie of speaking in the first place this was the practise of elihu one of the friends of iob who beeing the youngest in yeares dared not to shew his opinion till iob and others who were his ancients had spoken but when they had left off their talke then he is said to haue answered in his turne iob the sixt to giue the titles of reverence to all superiours sara according to this rule called abraham lord pet the man in the gospell comming to learne something of christ cals him by this name good master mark and anna rebuked by eli answered him with reuerence and said nay my lord sam the second rule touching honour due to superiours is more speciall touching superiours in authoritie namely that they also must be honoured and this honour shewes it selfe in foure things the first is speciall reuerence which stands in the performance of two duties the former is to stand when our superiors doe sitte for thus abraham after he had receiued the angels into his tent and prepared meat for them serued himself by them vnder the tree giuing attendance while they did eate gen in like manner when moses sate in iudgement the people are said to haue stood about him from morning vntill euening exod the latter is not to speake but by leaue a dutie alwaies to be obserued but specially in the courts of magistrates example whereof we haue in paul who beeing called before foelix the gouernour did not speake a word vntill the gouernour had beckened vnto him amp giue him leaue act the second thing is subiection which is no thing els but an inferioritie whereby we do as it were suspend our wills and reasons and withall cause them to depend in things lawful and honest vpon the will of the superiour this subiectio is yeelded to the authoritie of the superiour and is larger then obedience the third is obedience whereby wee keepe and performe the expresse commandement of our superior in all things lawful and honest it standeth in sundry particulars as first it must be in the lord and as to the lord himselfe whatsoeuer ye doe saith the apostle doe it heartily as to the lord and not vnto man column againe obedience must be performed euen to superiours that are euill thus peter exhorts servant to be subiect to their masters in all feare not onely to the good and courteous but also to the froward pet thirdly it must be done to rulers in whome we see weaknesses for their infirmities ought not to hinder or stoppe our dutie of obedience considering that the commaundement of honouring the father and mother is generall without exceptio fourthly it is to be performed to them that are deputies to rulers yes which are deputies of deputies submit your selues saith peter vnto all manner ordinance of man for the lord sake whether it be vnto the king as vnto the superiour or vnto gouernours as vnto them who are sent of him ampc pet fiftly though punishment be wrongfully and most vniustly imposed by rulers yet it must be borne without resistance till we can haue our remedie for this is thankeworthie if a man for conscience toward god indure griefe suffering wrongfully pet the practise of this we may see in hagar the handmaid of sara who is commanded by the angel to returne againe to her dame and humble her selfe vnder her hands though shee had dealt very roughly with her gen the fourth thing due to superiours in authoritie is thankesgiuing in praising god for their paines authoritie and gifts principally thus paul exhorts that praiers intercessions and thankesgiuing be made for kings and all that be in authoritie tim the reason is because beeing ouer vs in authoritie we haue the benefit of their gifts and authoritie gen in the second place commeth to be considered our honour due vnto our equalls concerning which there be two rules i rule equalls must esteeme better of others then of themselues thus paul exhorts all man in meekenes of minde without contention or vaine glorie to esteeme others better then themselues philipp ii rule equalls in giuing honour must goe one before another rom where the apostle saith not in taking honour because the dutie by him prescribed concernes not all persons but those alone who are of a like or equall condition a third sort to whome honour is to be yeelded are inferiours and the honour due vnto them is without all contempt in meeknes of spirit to respect them as brother this dutie the lord commands expressely to the king that his heart be not lifted vp above his brother deut the same was the practise of iob who saith of himselfe that he did not contemne the iudgement of his servant or of his maid when they did contend with him iob naaman the syrian thought it no disgrace to be advised and ordered by the counsell of his servant king and true it is that all superiours ought to keepe their state and place yet so as they haue respect also to such as are inferiour to them without scor or contempt lastly there is a kind of honour to be performed to a mans owne selfe which duty the apostle exhorteth vnto philipp where he saith if there be any vertue if there be any p ise thinke on these things by which he would teach vs not onely to tender the honour of our superiours equalls and inferiours but euen of our selues in seeking after vertue and praise that followeth after it but how should a man in righteous manner honour himselfe ans by obseruing two rules i rule we must preserue our selues in body and soule specially we must keepe the body that it be not made an instrument of sinne for when we doe vse our body as instruments of vncleanes then doe we bring a shame vpon them and it is the will of god that euery man should know how to possesse his vessel in holines and honour thes and that which is said of the bodie is to be vnderstood of the hand the heart the tongue and all the parts and members thereof ii rule if we would truly honour our selues we must honour god in all our waies for god will honour them who honour him sam now to honour god is to honour him according to his will and word in the duties of good conscience and good life on the contrarie they that dishonour god god will dishonour them before all the world and this must teach vs even to dedicate our selues to god and his providence in the whole course of our callings whether in the church or commonwealth ampc ampc ampc ampc ampc ampc pag lin dele and hedenies he denies mumnednesse nummednesse eight eighteenth dele

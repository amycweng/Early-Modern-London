the generall ayme and scope of this epistle is partly to declare the dutie of all christians and partly to set out the corruptions of those and these dayes and times in both which euery one may receiue edification who are desirous either to follow the former or auoid the latter in which generall consideration we are to note three things concerning this epistle before we come to shew the parts of it in particular first the authoritie secondly the superscription thirdly the argument or substance of it first concerning the authoritie two questions are to be answered the first question whether this epistle be canonicall scripture and secondly how we may know the certeinty of it concerning the former luther and others who acknowledge it to be a profitable w iting denie it to be canonicall scripture and alleage foure reasons first they say iude calleth himselfe a servant of iesus christ and not an apostle but all the new testament was penned or approued by some apostle this hindreth not but that he was one of the apostles who also called themselues seruats of iesus christ as paul rom and peter pet secondly by this reason the epistles to the philip and philemon as also of iames john ampc might be reiected thirdly he calleth himselfe as much as an apostle iude writeth of such things as the apostles themselues had formerly foretolde verse therefore hee was no apostle iude liued after the apostles paul and peter who with john were the last of the apostles and liuing after their decease who were the principal might very wel put them in minde of those things they had foretolde in the ninth verse hee bringeth in a profane author concerning the strife and disputation betweene michael the archangell and the diuell about moses body which cannot be found in canonical scripture as also of enoch the seauenth from adam out of profane writers by this reason neither should the epistle of titus bee scripture seeing paul makes mention of the profane poet epimenides titus nor the epistle to the corinthes where is brought in the speech of menander corinthian nor the actes of the apostles where aratus the poet is cited actes this epistle is taken out of saint peter from whom this author hath borrowed both the matter and manner therfore this iude was no apostle but some scholler of theirs if this were sufficient to proue this epistle not authenticall then the whole bookes of samuel the kinges and chronicles should be cast out of the canon by the same reason which take the matter from ciuill chronicles now if it be lawful to take matter out of ciuill chronicles why may not one scripture be taken out of another wee must therefore notwithstanding these weake allegations esteeme this epistle to bee the canonicall scripture and the eternall word of god as our church and the church in all ages hath receiued it and now in the second place see how wee may come to be resolued that it is so to be allowed which wee may in this resemblance an indenture betweene man and man is knowne to bee sufficient two waies first by the matter and contentes therin which plainly shewes an acte passed and done secondly by adding and annexing thereunto certaine outward signes and testimonies as the handes and seales of the parties the handes and names of the witnesses corroborating and strengthening the same the first is good in it selfe though not so confirmed to the parties without the second but the second is nothing without the first but if both th se shall concurre and bee specified in the indenture then it is absolutely authenticall both in it selfe and vnto the parties if this be applied to the scripture it shall be apparant to bee no lesse ratified then such an indenture for first consider but the contentes and matter it selfe of it it will speake the certeinty and truth of it read ouer the epistle you shall finde the whole matter agreed vpon by the prophets and apostles and for the testimonie the catholike and common consent of the church or greatest part since the apostles dayes hath set to her hand and seale that it is the truth of god no lesse assured then other bookes of the canon which assent of the church though it cannot make vs yet may moue vs accordinglie to entertayne it besides if we consider the endes as also the effects of this scripture which are the same with any part of the canonicall wee cannot but confesse that it is the holy and sacred truth of god all of it conspiring with all the other to the aduancing of god glorie and furthering of mans saluation so much of the authoritie of this epistle the second point is the superscription which is in these words the catholique epistle of iude this title seemes to bee prefixed rather by some scribe afterwards then by iude himselfe first because this title catholique was not heard of in the church whilest the apostles liued so as it is not so ancient as the epistle secondly the title seemes to bee vnfit for this and other epistles intitled after the same manner and may be well forborne as the epistles of peter are called canonicall which are no more canonicall then others thirdly most of the post scripts are vncerteine if not false as of that after the second epistle to timothie in which timothie is called an elect bishop of ephesus and yet commaunded to doe the worke of an euangelist timoth which cannot stand together to be the bishop of one place and also vniuersally to preach vnto the whole world following the apostles as the euangelistes duty was and so of others this title then was not added by the apostle but by some scribe that copied out the epistle it is not therefore holy scripture as the epistle is the third point concerning the epistle in generall is the argument which doth exhort all christians to constancie and perseuerance in their profession of the gospell secondly to beware and take heede of false teachers and deceiuers which craftely creepe in amongst them and thirdly these deceiuers are liuely set out in their colours and with them their destruction now concerning the epistle it selfe and the speciall partes of it of it there be three partes first a salutation in the and verses secondlie an exhortation from the verse to the end of the thirdly a conclusion from that to the end of the chapter in the salutation consider three thinges first the person that wrote this epistle iude secondly the persons to whom hee wrote to those which were called sanctified of god the father and reserued to iesus christ thirdly the prayer ordinarie in apostolicall salutations mercie vnto you ampc concerning the first namely the writer of this epistle obserue three thinges first his name iude secondly his office a servant of iesus christ thirdly his allyance and brother hood being of the kindred of christ himselfe first of his name iude or iudas which was the name of two of the disciples of christ the first was iudas the son of alpheus the brother of iames and so neare allyed vnto christ who was the writer of this epistle the other was iudas iscariot or iudas the traytor the son of simon who could not write this epistle because he died before christ in this name consider two thinges first the occasion of it and secondly the varietie of his name the occasion of this name is set downe with the reason of it in the of gen when leah had borne three sonnes vnto iacob shee conceiued againe and bare a fourth son saying now i will praise the lord therefore shee called his name iudah which signifieth praise or confession so no doubt did alpheus the father of this iude at his birth giue him such a name as might moue not only himselfe but his child after him to thankfulnes and confession of god goodnes so ought euery father in imposing his childrens names with alpheus and euery mother with leah make such choice of names as themselues and their children may bee put in minde yes and stirred vp to good duties euen so often as they shal heare or remember their own names the second point in this name is the variety of the names of iude hee was called thaddeus mark and lebbeus matth all which signifie the same thin gand all put in minde of the same dutie here two questions may bee asked first why was he called by so many names some thinke he had all these names giuen him by the people and multitude as signifying all one thing others which is more probable that hee was thus called by the apostles themselues rather then by his owne name that the horrible fact of iudas in betraying his maister should bee vtterly with his name forgotten a second question is whether may a man change his name or no if the change thereof be no preiuidce to any man much lesse hurtefull to the church or common welth nor offendeth the faithfull but wholy tendeth to the glory of god and good of man it may be altred and changed as saul a great persecutor being called to be a publisher and patron of the gospell changed his name into paul as also salomon was at the first called by his mother iedidiah peter at first called simon bariones christ afterwards gaue him a new name and he accepted it yet hence the too common practise of the world cannot bee warranted who for fraud and deceite doe alter their names which when it is not intended may warrantably bee done as in time of persecution in the raigne of king edward the bucer changed his name and both called himselfe and suffered others to call him aretius felinus so did diverse other worthie man in those dayes seeking no other then the glory of god and good of the church in their owne saftie and that the papists not knowing their names might reade their writinges without preiudice the second thing in the person writing is his office being called a servant of iesus christ which is not so generallie to be vnderstood as ment of euery professor of christ and beleeuer who is a servant of the lord iesus but of a speciall seruice namely of apostleship to which he was deputed wherein consider two thinges first that he was called to bee an apostle and servant of christ to plant the church of the gentiles secondly that he did faithfully execute his function and performed his seruice first he pleades his calling for two causes first in regard of others and secondly in respect of himselfe first that his doctrine might with more attention and reuerence be receiued of others seeing he run not vnsent but was called and that to an apostleship and therefore he spake not of himselfe but whollie and immediately directed by god secondly for the confirming and comforting of himselfe that the lord who had called him would stand by him both in protecting his person and prospering his worke in his hand vse seeing the apostle iude before he writeth laieth down his calling so ought all ministers to make their calling the foundation of all their proceedings containing themselues within the compasse thereof euen as they are to teach the same dutie vnto all sortes of man that they tempt not the lord by passing the bonds and limites of their calling secondly in that iude though he was of the same tribe yes of neare allyance vnto christ yet hee passeth by all these respectes which hee might haue stood vpon and contenteth himselfe with the title of a servant of christ we learne to make more account and esteeme it a greater priuiledge to be a servant of iesus christ than to bee of the kindred of kinges and allyed to the greatest monarchs of the world christ himselfe shewes vs what kindred should take vp our chiefe delight when hee turned himselfe from his mother and brother and beholding his hearers said those were his mother sisters and brother that heare the word of god and keepe it this alliance in the faith was neerer and dearer vnto him then that in the flesh if then thou standest vpon thy preferment striue to be the servant of christ which is more honorable then to be the son of a king to be a follower of chist is more then to goe before the rulers of the earth but if thou aske how shall i come to this preferment himselfe answereth thee thou must giue vp thy selfe to heare his word and doe it that is learne to know and obey his will this is the maine dutie of a servant endeuour to please the lord in keeping faith and good conscience thou article in the way of preferment and article admitted a servant of christ thirdly if wee bee admitted the seruantes and followers of christ wee must serue no other maister but keepe our selues from being intangled either with the offences or affairs of the world as to be vassals thereto no man can serue two much lesse more maisters of such contrarie commaundes let none pretend to bee the servant of christ who by louing pleasure more the god or seeking earth more then heauen disgrace such a profession the third thing in the person writing is the allyance brother of iames of which name there were two first iames the son of zebedeus whose death is mentioned in the of the actes by herod the second was the son of alpheus here mentioned first that he might distinguish himselfe from the other iudas the traytour secondly that he might winne further credit and attention to his doctrine seeing hee was no vnknowne person but one that came of the worthiest stock that was vpon the face of the earth and for this cause hee mentioneth his brother iames who was better knowne as being the president of the councell at ierusalem and a choise pillar of the church in his time act not to credit himselfe but this scripture which otherwise is in it selfe sufficiently powerful by the mention of him now followes the second thing in the salutation that is the person to whom iude wrote in these words vnto those who are called and sanctified by god the father and preserued by iesus christ it is the militant catholique church which is liuelie described to be the number of beleeuers dispersed thorough the face of the whole world who are effectually called and sanctified and preserued vnto life euerlasting out of which description note first who and what they bee that are members of this church namely no wicked or profane persons but onely the elect such as are chosen vnto life euerlasting who after receiue their calling vnto holines and therein are assuredly preserued vnto life which priuiledges no wicked person no vnrepentant sinner can be partaker of but onely the church of the first borne as in heb the whose names are written in the booke of life and who receiue daily spirituall increase for howsoeuer in the catholike church there be two sorts of man professing religion the one of them that do vnfainedly beleeue and are sanctified the other of them who make a shew of faith but indeede beleeue not but remaine in their sinnes of the former doth the catholike church consist and not of the latter who are no members s t into the head of this body though they may seeme so to bee secondly this confuteth the roman church who teach and hold that a reprobate may be a member of this church thirdly that none can bee the head of this church and catholique congregation but onely christ for he only knoweth them who and where they be thorough the face of the whole earth not the pope or any other creature hath any headship ouer this company who are giuen and properly appertaine vnto the son of god fourthly that this catholique church is inuisible and cannot by the eie of flesh be discerned for what eye except of faith can see or discerne the depth of god election or whom he hath effectually called yes and who can infalliblie determine of the things that are within a man and therefore this is a matter of faith not of sense an article of our beleefe not the obiect of our sight seeing faith is an euidence of thinges not seene which againe ouerthroweth that roman doctrine which teacheth that the catholike church is visible and apparent vpon earth and so destroy that article of our faith fiftly that this catholike church being preserued by god the father to life euerlasting cannot vtterly perish and bee dissolued all other congregations and particular churches being mixed and the greatest part not predestinate may faile yet this cannot be ouercome rom this election of god shall obtaine though the rest be hardened the gates of hell shall not preuaile against the faith of the church because faithfull and true is hee that hath spoken and who will preserue in this church a succession of wholsome and sound doctrine and heauen and earth shall be sooner dissolued than on iote of the same shall faile and perish but though that faile not the church may fall from that and so faile that particular churches and of them the most famous haue been ruined yes and fallen away and so may doe is euident by the churches of ephesus corinthian galatia ampc and no maruell seeing these consisted euer of mixed persons but the catholique church consisting onelie of a number elected and called though it also not being as yet without wrinkle may erre and faile in some smaller points yet being preserued by god to life cannot possibly faile in the maine and foundation this doctrine affordeth strong consolation to the elect of god both in regard of their frequent falles and infirmities whereby they might feare to cast themselues quite out of fauor as also in regard of the manifold assaultes and bickerings which in the world they doe and shall endure whereby they might seeme to the outward veiw to perish yet the truth is neither of both need so dismay them but that their faith and hope may still bee reuiued and strengthened seeing they are preserued to saluation sixtly here are better notes of a true church then the papistes antiquity succession multitude ampc which can bee no notes frst for antiquitie in the beginning was a true church but no antiquitie secondly succession failes for what man soeuer are called and sanctified are the church thirdly multitude no note for if there be a calling and sanctification of man there is a church be there many or few but the true notes are the meanes of calling to the faith by the doctrine of the prophets and apostles and obedience thereunto proceeding forward in sanctification euen vntill death without which notes none can truly say they are of the catholique church by which we may know the church of england to be the true visible church of god called and sanctified in the truth ioh now to proceede wee are in the next place to intreate of the order which god obserueth in bringing man by degrees to life euerlasting and first of the calling mentioned which is a worke of god who of his meere fauour and grace calleth vile and miserable man out of the world and inuiteth them to life euerlasting to vnderstand which we must know that the calling of god is two fold the first is generall when god calles a whole nation kingdome and country that is when hee offers them saluation in the meanes as when hee sends his word amongst them affordes them the sacraments to seale the couenant giue leaue to approch him in prayer and all this in the ministrie of man that man might call man yes when hee vouchsafeth priuate meanes farre inferior to the former yet often seruing for a generall calling a is the reading of the scriptures yes of mens writings and some time report as in rahab example and the woman of samaria by these meanes the lord generally calleth man offer but often not giuing grace offered in great iudgement turning away from a froward people if god offer but giue not grace it is a deluding of man no for first a man was once able to receiue it secondly hereby hee maketh them without execuse whom he will destroy thirdly hereby he keepes the wicked in outward order vse considering to be called of god is the first step to life euerlasting and we in this church of england are thus called it remaines that euery man should answere this calling how shall this be done frame thy heart to answere god as dauid did when god bad him seeke his face thy face o lord will i seeke see also marke of the father of the possessed child and psalm whe dauids eare was pearced hee answered lord i come this ought to be the answer of our hartes to the lord voice sounding in the ministry the second calling is more speciall when grace is not only offered but giuen also by god thorough the effectuall working of his spirit in our hearts which is the beginning of grace in vs hee himselfe laying the first foundation of it by giuing power to receiue the word to mingle it with faith and bring forth the fruites of new obedience for the better conceiuing of the nature of it consider sixe pointes first the ground and foundation of it namely god eternall free election of vs vnto life euerlasting as tim when i say free i exclude not only whatsoeuer man can imagine within himselfe as vaine in procuring such good vnto himselfe as not of works saith paul least any should boast but also placing the ground of all our good out of our selues in the counsell of god which the apostle calles his good purpose rom yes to shew the freenes of this grace it is thence denominated and called the election of grace secondly the meanes of this calling which in the lord hands are diverse whereof some prepare to calling othersome are instruments of it as first the reading of the scriptures seruing to bege generall historicall faith secondly afflictions in bodie goods name friends or otherwise tending to humble a man and prepare his heart as soft ground thirdly the denouncing of god iudgements and threats of the law which sends to hell but giues no grace these are generall preparatiues others are instruments to effect inward calling as the preaching of the glad tidings of the gospell which is the most principall and effectuall meanes of this speciall and effectuall vocation and to this paul ascribes it as thess whereunto he called you by our gospell that this is true consider a two fold worke of this ministerie when it is powerfully applied to the hearts of man first it openeth the very heart of a man and laies him out to the beholding of himselfe shewing him that by his detestable sins he hath made himselfe more vgly in god eyes than any toade can be in mans whereby he is prepared not to lie asleep in this estate but vnto the second worke which is to apprehend and applie the blood and merits of christ exhibited in the gospell for the washing and bathing of his sinfull soule that so he may be saued from wrath thirdly the persons that are called those are mentioned rom namely those whom hee had before predestinate those he called which seemes to be expounded in acts so many as were ordained to life euerlasting beleeued that is were called vnto the faith all therefore are not called it pleaseth some to teach another doctrine namely that god for his part calls all man effectually and giues them a power to beleeue if they will but the difference say they is in the will of man to prooue which they bring this comparison the sun shines on waxe and clay equally the waxe is softned but the clay is hardened but this is not true out of the scriptures for it is not giuen to all to vnderstand the mysteries of the kingdome matth these things are hid from most of the wise of the world and reueiled vnto babes matth knowledge is giuen to some not to others and consequently faith for they which haue not knowne cannot beleeue fourthly the time of this calling the particular time of any mans calling is not reueiled but laid vp in the secret counsell of god in whose hands times and seasons are yet the extent of the time is large enough though stinted euen the time of this life some at the sixt houre some at the ninth and others at the eleuenth ampc but not after because that then all means of calling man cease now because man know not the date of their daies it behoues them out of hand to striue to enter not to deferre from day to day alleaging that some are called at the twelfth houre but accept of y e lord call while it is yet the acceptable time if the lord now say seeke my face let thy heart answere as an eccho which akes the word out of the mouth thy face o lord i will seeke psalm such a pleasant harmonie god is delighted with if he say as the prophet speaketh behold now my people they are presently readie to answere behold now our god and the rather because the lord will be free and not stinted by thee that either he should call thee in thy crooked yeeres or not at all he will not be prescribed vnto extraordinarily to call thee at the twelfth houre as he did the theefe on the crosse when thou howlest vpon the bed of thy sorrow and gaspest vpon thy death bed therefore while it is called to day let vs heare the voyce and harden our hearts no more fiftly wherein doth this effectuall calling stand both in the outward and inward calling because the former is often in the meanes giuen to nation people man at least to make them without all excuse but the second being secret and inward whereby the lord makes a mans heart inwardly answere the outward calling possesseth him with a willing mind stedfastly to beleeue in the lord iesus and with an endeuour to please the lord in all things thus is the heart pearced psalm the heart of stone changed into an hart of flesh that is made tractable and pliable ezech and an heart which is a sacrifice accepted of god such an hart was lydia act when god had opened it it was heedfull and attentiue to the words of paul this hart can rellish the sweete promises of the gospell and no other sixtly the excellencie of this calling which wee shall perceiue by these considerations first in that it is a great work as was the creation of man at the first rom so the apostle maketh it corinthian he that at the beginning called light out of darknes the same hath shined in our hearts ampc that as god cals the first time and dead creatures come foorth to life so with no lesse powerfull voyce the lord cals the second time the heart of man dead in sinne and it is quickened with the life of god secondly this effectuall calling goes beyond the worke of our creation for here a man is taken out of the first adam and set into the second and at the same instant power is giuen to beleeue being in time both together though in order faith is first and then ingrafting wherein is not onely a bare priuation as in the creation when god called things that were not as though they were but here is a plaine resistance and rebellion god calling not onely things that are not but things that would not and refuse to be thus to raise a man out of the blood of christ is more than to raise eue out of adams side to raise a dead soule from the death of sinne farre more glorious and powerfull than to raise a dead bodie from bodily death to raise a man to supernaturall life farre greater than to a naturall onely thirdly this calling ratifies all our couenants with god man in their baptisme enter couenant with god but often start from it and will not stand to it so as the couenant is onely made but when as a man is effectually called the couenant is not onely made but truly accomplished and that on mans part vse seeing we are called of god himselfe in the ministerie of the word for paul calles it philipp an high calling we must labour to ioyne the inward calling with it which is higher than that by hauing first a griefe because we cannot beleeue secondly a readie mind thirdly an endeuour to beleeue fourthly a sorrow because we beleeue no more and faile so much in the seruice of god which if we want we must labour for the and if wee haue them be thankfull vnto god for them vse learne the dutie laid downe by the apostle ephesian that we should walke worthie of our calling to doe which first we must looke that we frame our liues holily being holy in our whole conuersation as he that hath called vs is holie secondly there must be the same end of our liues which is of god calling that is to bring vs to heauen the end of our being in the world is to be called out of the world and as abraham to obey god as looking for a citie in heauen not made with hands now we proceede to the second step of life eternall which is sanctification this name is taken from the latins and by it is vnderstood regeneration renouation new creation and to be sanctified is to be made holie and be borne anew that wee the better know this grace consider sundrie points first what sanctification is it is an inward change of a man iustified whereby the image of god is restored in him for the opening of which description marke that first i call it a change of a man to put a difference betweene it and ciuill conuersation which is a gift of god likewise as this is but farre different from it because this onely restraineth the corruption of the heart whereas sanctification reneweth the heart and thus the gifts of god are of two sorts first restraining which doe keepe in the wickednes of the heart such as are all ciuill vertues secondly renuing or altering the minde which not only represseth but abolisheth corruption of this kinde is sanctification secondly i call it an inward change namely in the minde will affections as working vpon the inward corruptions and lusts of the heart to distinguish it from outward sanctification which a wicked man may haue whereby he reformeth his outward man and cariage by the ministerie of the word such are they whom the apostle speakes of heb which tread vnder their feet the blood of christ whereby they were sanctified namely externally this is of another kinde working the inward change of the heart thirdly i adde of a man iustified for two causes first to shew that iustification and sanctification are two diverse gifts of god and their difference may appeare in three things first in that iustification is out of a man sanctification is within him secondly iustification absolues a sinner and makes him stand righteous at the barre of god iudgement sanctification cannot doe this thirdly iustification brings peace of conscience so doth not sanctification but followeth that peace thus the apostle hath them distinct corinthian ye are washed ye are iustified and sanctified as also corinthian christ is made to vs righteousnes and sanctification secondly because iustification goes with sanctification though iustification be before in nature yet they are wrought at the same time for when god accepts a mans person then is hee made iust who is also sanctified fourthly i say the image of god is hereby restored the which that we may know wherein it consisteth consider the three folde estate of man the first of innocencie the second after the fall and the third vnder christ first in innocencie man had three things first substance of bodie amp soule secondly the faculties of soule as reason and vnderstanding thirdly the image of god standing in the conformitie of the whole man to the will of god secondly in the state after the fall man hath two of these first substance of bodie and soule secondly faculties as before but the third is wanting standing in righteousnesse and holinesse and in stead of it is found in euery man original sinne which distempereth and disordereth the whole man his minde will and affections and carrieth him against the will of god in the third condition vnder christ wee haue three things first substance of bodie and soule secondly faculties of the reasonable soule thirdly a new created holines and righteousnesse before lost but now restored by grace aboue nature and this is a renewed conformitie to the will of god and the image of god againe restored where note that sanctification is such a gift of god as changeth the man not the substance of the bodie or the faculties of the soule but the corruption disorder and sinfulnes of man it rectifieth but abolisheth not affections if a man be of sad disposition it neither increaseth nor taketh away but moderates his sorrow and keepes it in order so if a man bee of a merrie disposition it depriues him not of his mirth but corrects it that it exceede not so in choler and other complexions then those that feare to labour in their sanctification because then they must be solitarie sad and cannot be merrie and those that thus obiect against those who endeuour ouer their owne reformation may see themselues deceiued seeing it onely tempereth the affections to such moderation as becommeth holines the second point is whence haue we our sanctification whether from our parents or from what originall no it cannot flow from the parents no although they be holy who ca bring a cleane thing out of filthine there is n one iob the new birth is not of blood nor the will of flesh nor of man for parents must bee considered two waies first as they are man children of adam thus they bring their children and conuey no more to their children than adam did which is nature together with the corruption of it holy parents haue no sinne for it is mortified in them therefore they cannot deriue it to their children notwithstanding their sanctification they conuey the nature and sinne of adam which comes thus to passe god in the beginning gaue this law that whatsoeuer adam receiued he should receiue it for himselfe and his posteritie and whatsoeuer he lost he should lose from himselfe and all his posteritie by vertue of which law parents sanctified bring foorth children vnsanctified which may appeare by this coparison take wheate make it as cleane as you can sow it and it will come vp not as it was sowen but in stalke blade and eare and it brings vp as much chaffe as euer it did though none were sowen with it what is the reason hereof but onely the order set in nature by god at the first so parents let them be neuer so holie by vertue of the former lawe bring foorth vnholie children secondly parents must be considered as holy man sonnes of the second adam by a second birth and thus they produce not their children nor deriue their holines into them although their holinesse may be a meanes to bring them within the couenant whence note that y e soule of the child is not deriued fro the soule of the father as the body is fro his body for then shuld they haue the same properties with the soule of the parents so euery regenerate man should deriue a regenerate soule vnto the infant which is false not onely in many examples but in that originall sinne infecteth euery infants soule aswell of the beleeuing as vnbeleeuing parent but if sanctification be not from the parent whence is it from christ who is made of god vnto vs sanctification corinthian coloss in him are hid all the treasures of it of whose fulnes we receiue grace for grace ioh wherein two further points are to be knowne first what thing in christ is the roote of our sanctification namely christ his holines as he is man euen as adams vnrighteousnes is the roote of our corruption secondly that seeing he is the root of our sanctification it is necessarie there be a coniunction and vnion betweene him and vs before we can partake of his holines and it is the bond of faith which knits vs as members vnto him the head in which regard the apostle saith he is made of god our sanctification corinthian that is the roote and author of it a third point is the measure of our sanctification which is but in part giuen vs in this life the most regenerate man being partly flesh and partly spirit appearing in this comparison take a vessell full of water let a portion be taken out and an equall portion of hot water put in it become luke warme all of it partly hote and partly cold euen so euery man is a vessell of water filled with corruption to the brim if a part of his corruption be taken away and a proportionall part of holines put in stead of it the whole man becomes partly holy partly vnholy of which wee haue an example in moses number who in smiting the rock so as the water gushed out bewrayed the mixture of faith with vnbeleefe in the same action he takes the staffe therein he obeyed god but he strikes the rocke twice being commanded only to speake to it and therein he disobeyed for which the lord was angrie a fourth point is touching the parts of sanctification which may be diuided two waies first it is diuided into mortification and viuification mortification is a part of sanctification whereby the power tyrannie and strength of originall sinne is weakned and also by little and little abolished which be cosidered to be not in one part onely but throughout so as when one part of originall sinne decaieth so doth also the rest the ground of which is the vertue and efficacie of christs death which if any aske what it is and what power it can haue since it is ended i answere it is that power of his godhead whereby on the crosse hee sust ined his manhood and so made his death a satisfaction to the iustice of god for mans sinne it will be further asked how come we to be partakers of this vertue of christs death and to feele the power of it in our hearts so soone as any man by faith begins to be vnited vnto christ his death is applied vnto him so that by meanes of our coniunction with christ we as truly partake of that power of his as he himselfe was on the crosse susteined by it then he feeles sin wounded in him and dying dailie to which hee cannot liue as before the second part of sanctification is viuification or quickning and it is when christ dwels and raignes in our hearts by his spirit so as we can say we henceforth liue not but christ in vs the foundation of which is the vertue of christs resurrection which is nothing else but the power of his godhead raising his manhood and freeing him from the punishment and tyrannie of our sinnes this power is conueied from him vnto all his members who being mystically conioyned with him are thereby raised from the graue of their sinnes the second diuision is taken from the faculties of man which are seauen in number the minde memorie conscience will affections appetite the life it selfe in all which this grace of god must appeare the minde is that part of man which frameth the reason this paul calleth ephesian the spirit of our minde which must be renewed the sanctification of which is called reu the eye salue it is a grace cleering the darke minde and dimme vnderstanding containing in it these three things first sauing knowledge corinthian whereby we know the things giuen vs of god some will say what be they ans this knowledge may be referred to two heads the first is the knowledge of god the second is the knowledge of our selues the former of these hath two branches first that knowledge of the true god which is life euerlasting ioh secondly to know the mercie of god in christ to my selfe in particular ephesian this is to know the height length and depth of the loue of god to me in special as that god the father is my father god the son my sauiour god the holy ghost my sanctifier this is the sauing knogledge of god the second head of this sauing knowledge is to know a mans selfe when hee sees the secret corruptions of his heart against the first and second table to see and to feele this is a worke of grace and an argument of an heauenlie light enlightening the soule the second thing in the sanctification of the minde is after the knowledge of these to approoue the things of god that is to minde and meditate on things spirituall rom to sauour the things of the spirit namely things pertaining to the kingdome of god contrarie to the practise of them whose glory is their shame yes whose end is damnation philipp who minde earthly things the third thing is a setled purpose in the minde not to offend god in any thing but to endeuour the doing of his will and the pleasing of him in al things this is called the turning of the mind and is the substance of true repentance the memorie the sanctification of it is an aptnes by grace to keepe good things specially the doctrine of saluation by which dauid was preserued from sinning psalm and mary pondred things concerning christ and laid them vp in her heart luke the sanctification of the conscience is an aptnes to testifie alwaies truly that a mans sinnes are pardoned and that hee preserueth in his heart a care to please god corinthian this testimonie was pauls reioycing and hezekias comfort on his death bed was the testimonie of his conscience of his vpright walking before god yes this conscience is apt also to checke and curb vs when wee encline to euill so dauid saith psalm his r ines did correct him in the night season and to stirre vs vp to good as the voyce behind vs saying here is the way walke in it esay the will is sanctified when god giues grace truly to will good as to beleeue feare obey god when a man can say that though he finde not to performe that which is good yet to will good is present with him rom this is much accepted of god for where the minde and other faculties faile in their dutie then comes this will and supplies their want which being willing to doe much more then it can the lord of his mercie accepts it for the deede it selfe for the affections some of them concerne god some our neighbour and some our selues sanctified affections concerning god are first fe re of god when a man stands in awe of god presence and in regard of his commandements secondly a contentment and quietnes of minde in all conditions of life when a man at all times can submit his will vnto the will of god iob the lord hath giuen and taken away blessed be his name and dauid psalm i held my tongue and said nothing because thou lord didst it thirdly loue to god in christ and to christ in man corinthian rom fourthly an high estimation of christ and his blood aboue all things in the world philip i count all things d ng for christ secondly the affections towards our neighbour is to loue him because hee is god childe in my iudgement epistle ioh and in christ my brother thirdly concerning our selues to haue a base estimation of our selues in regard of our knowne sinnes and corruptions paul cried out that he was the head of all sinners so the prodigall son i am not worthie to call thee father dauid haue mercie on me according to the multitude of thy mercie the sanctification of appetite stands in the holie ordering of our desires in meate drinke apparell riches ampc and in the practise of three maine vertues first sobrietie secondly chastitie thirdly contentation by which the appetite must be gouerned sanctification of life stands principally in three things first in an endeuour to doe the will of god that herein wee may testifie our thankfulnes secondly in testifying our loue to god in man thirdly in deniall of our selues which is first when wee hold god to be wiser than we a that so wee should be both directed and disposed of by him secondly when wee account him more carefull for vs than we our selues can be and so rest well satisfied with what condition of life so euer he sets vs in thus are we to practise this grace through our whole conuersation for wee may not measure it nor iudge of it by one action good or bad but looke to the whole course of life if that be good the heart is sanctified the fifth point is how sanctification is here ascribed to god the father seeing all outward workes are common to the whole trinitie ans sanctification is attributed and that truly to all the three persons who haue all stroke in the worke of it but diuersly the son sanctifieth by meriting sanctification the holy spirit sanctifieth by working it and by creating the new heart the father sanctifieth by sending his son to merit and giuing his spirit to work it and here the worke is thus ascribed vnto him as being the ground and first author of it vse labour for the speciall grace of god the meanes wee are to vse is laid down in rom to the verse namely to beleeue that we were crucified with christ buried with him yes and rose againe with him because he was vpon the crosse in the graue as also in rising from thence in our stead and roome sustaining our persons vpon him this is the foundation of our holinesse some will aske how this can be a ground of our holines i make it plaine in this comparison as a traitour arraigned and hanged according to law is then freed from his fact the iudge ceaseth to punish him and he ceaseth to be a traitour committeth no more misdemeanour so the sinner being arraigned at the barre of god iustice and attainted of high treason is according to god law condemned and executed in christs condemnation and execution is now as a dead man vnto sinne and cannot thencefoorth liue thereunto any more now followes the third degree of life eternal in these words and reserued to iesus christ the meaning of which words is plaine in the epistle of peter the where he saith that the elect are kept by the power of god vnto saluation in the adding of which words to the former wee are taught that with the gifts of true faith calling and sanctification is ioyned vnseparably the grace of perseuerance vnto the end of which truth we will consider foure maine grounds the first ground is the election of god that is his decree wherby he setteth some apart to life this decree is as vnchangeable as god himselfe is and as election is vnchangeable so is the fruite of it in vs in respect of the ground and hence followeth it that faith and sanctification are vnchangeable rom the predestinate are glorified matth the exception sheweth it impossible the elect should be deceiued the second ground is the promise of god in the euangelicall couenant which is largely propounded in ierem where is promise made of two things first the lord promiseth that he will not turne from them to doe them good which is a promise of eternall mercie shewing the pardon of sinne being once giuen is giuen for euer secondly that he will put his feare into their hearts there is promised continuance of faith and sanctification for they shall not depart from it the third ground is the office of christ in it consider first his priesthood secondly his kingly office first he was a priest partly to offer sacrifice partly to make intercession for euery beleeuer so hee did for peter luke that his faith might not fa and not onely for him but as appeares in that worthy prayer recommended in ioh for all the disciples and not for them onely but for all beleeuers through their word the same request is in that chapter repeated thrice secondly for his kingdome as he is the head of his church his office is to keepe all that are giuen him vnto life ioh i giue vnto them life and none can plucke them out of my hands to giue spirituall life to his members rom if christ the head died but once and liueth for euer then all his members die but once to sin and after alwaies liue to righteousnes for this life admits of no corruption neither in nor out of temptation the fourth ground is the qualitie of grace as of faith sanctification ampc whose nature is to endure to life euerlasting for he that once beleeues remaines euer a beleeuer ioh he that is borne of god sinneth not because the seed remaineth in him now if that remaine whereby he is borne of god himselfe must also still remaine borne of god vpon which foure grounds we may perswade our selues of the gift of perseuerance it is alleaged nothing is vnchangeable but god and therefore grace is changeable euery gift is changeable in it selfe so man in himselfe considered may fall away but god hath promised a second grace confirming the first by vertue whereof a man cannot fall away it will be further said that the child of god when he falleth into a grieuous sin as dauid did is guiltie of death and therfore is not iustified and consequently falleth away when dauid fell hee was guiltie of death but onely in regard of that sinne into which he was now fallen all his former sinnes being pardoned yes that sin also was pardoned though not actually to him before his repentance yet in god counsell so as that sinne being on god part pardoned he remaines still in the fauour of god but in time of persecution many fall away if any fall quite away they neuer had true faith which stands in three things knowledge assent apprehension of christ the two former they might haue but the third was wanting vnto them againe those that fall off in persecution if they haue true faith they fall not wholy because the seed of god remaines in them nor finally because in time they shall returne vnto the lord againe but this doctrine leades man to securitie no it leades a man from securitie vnto a new life and watchfulnes seeing grace is added vnto grace to keepe vs in the state of grace vse first in y t the gift of perseuerance is ioyned with true faith i gather that the doctrine of the papists is not of god but a doctrine of diuels which teacheth that he which is chosen of god who hath true faith and is iustified may in regard of his present right fall away for how can that be if hee that be chosen be called sanctified and preserued vnto life secondly it is false that a man trulie iustified may lose his grace seeing with iustification is ioyned preseruation neither that which teacheth that a true beleeuer may fall wholy though not finally is true thirdly those also are deceiued who thinke that mans saluation is pinned vpon his owne sleeue and hangeth vpon his owne will for god would haue all saued christ died for all the holy ghost giues grace to all why then are some saued some not it is say they from their owne wil grace in some preuailes against flesh and they are saued but flesh against grace in the other who therfore are damned but this scripture shewes that to be but a deuice of man seeing whosoeuer are once elected are called sanctified and preserued to life and what malice is able to resist this will of god vse note here the vnspeakeable goodnes of god in the worke of regeneration in that he not only giues a new life but preserues it in vs adam once had this life of grace betrusted vnto him and had it in keeping but he quickly lost it from himselfe and his posteritie now god hath restored this life againe to beleeuers but that they might be sure of it he will now keepe it for them himselfe and reserued vnto christ that is to be presented and set before christ and that partly in the day of death partly in the day of iudgement holie and without blame ephesian whence note first beleeuers need not feare the day of death or iudgement nay rather they may reioice in it as the day of their redemption yes and of triumph what an honor was it for pharaohs daughter to be presented to salomon and hester to become the spouse of a asuerus much more glorie is it for the faithfull thus to stand before christ at that day secondly wee must all our life long prepare and fit our selues to be presented as pure spouses to our bridegrome both these duties are laid downe revelation be glad and reioyce for the marriage of the lambe is come and his wife hath made her selfe readie this preparation stands in two things first we must betroth our soules to christ this is done when god giues christ and we receiue him by faith cleaue vnto him alone depend on him as the spouse vpon whom her soule loueth secondly wee must beautifie our soules hauing giuen them to christ this is done when the holie ghost sanctifieth the same and we daily labour in the renewing of our owne hearts thirdly we must hence be stirred vp to prayer for this gift of preseruation to life euerlasting amp reseruation to christ hungring for grace after grace to bee strengthened in temptation especially in this last and declining age wherein the gospell takes little place in our hearts verse mercie vnto you and peace and loue be multiplied in these words is laid downe the third point in the salutation namely the prayer vsually obserued in apostolic salutations in which first he prayeth for three things mercie peace and loue secondly that these may be multiplied that is continued and increased in and vpon them first of the multiplying of mercie the mercie of god towards the creature is taken in scripture two waies generally and specially god general mercie is that wherby he is inclined to helpe the creature in miserie luke god speciall mercie called riches of mercie whereby he will haue mercie on whom he will rom is that by which is granted pardon of sinne and acceptance in christ to life euerlasting and for this hee prayeth in this place now because this speciall mercie cannot be multiplied in it selfe being infinite in god as himselfe is infinite therefore by mercie wee must vnderstand the fruites and effects thereof and for our better instruction herein three things are to be considered first that mercie is asked in the first place before peace and loue teaching vs that the mercie of god in christ is to be sought for aboue al things in the world psalm many say who will shew vs any good i but lord lift th vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs psalm let thy tender mercie come vpon me that i may liue this is the foundation of all blessing secondly note the persons for whom he thus prayeth to you that is as in the first verse to those who were called sanctified and reserued to christ not for vnbeleeuers vnrepentant and apostatates whence we learne first that a man iustified sanctified and made heire of life cannot merit any thing at god hands for merit and mercy cannot stand together amp he that still stands in need of mercie can neuer merit which doctrine must be maintained against the romane church which teacheth that a man may put his trust in the merit of his workes so he doe it soberly secondly that man effectually called and sanctified because they still stand in neede of mercie must be in their owne eyes still vile and miserable abraham being to speak to god tearmes himselfe dust and ashes iacob acknowledged that he was lesse than the least mercie iob cries out that he was vile and abhorres himselfe after these examples we must euer keep our hearts as emptie vessels readie to receiue more mercie thirdly note the measure of mercie asked he praies for continuance and increase of mercie to those who had alreadie the riches of mercie whence we learne first that all the good we haue or can doe is of meere mercie not onely for the beginning and continuance but also for the increase thereof as grace is no grace vnlesse it be euery way grace so also of mercie which takes away all conceit of merit seeing mercie filleth vp all the roome and leaues no place for merit secondly that the apostle here also cofirmeth the former grounds of our perseuerance for by this prayer grace is to be added to the former graces yes multiplied so the lord dealeth not giuing ouer when he hath giuen one grace for first he giues his servant power to beleeue secondly he giues an execution of this power neither there giues ouer but by a third grace giues continuance of that power yes and addes a fourth which is an execution of that continuance thus he deales with all true beleeuers not onely in respect of faith but of obedience also philipp god worketh both the will and the deed philip he that hath begun this good worke in you will performe i vntill the day of christ so as this may well be called a multiplication of grace seeing euery beleeuer hath one grace more than adam had he had power to obey so the renewed haue secondly he had the act of obedience so they also haue thirdly hee had power to perseuere which they likewise haue but hee had not the act of perseuerance which they hauing therein farre excell him the second thing desired in the prayer is peace namely the peace of god whereof he is the author and it is the vniti and concord of man with god and with the creatures touching this peace note three things the foundation of it which is christ the second adam euen as the first adam was the author of discord and emnitie ephesian secondly the manifestation of it this peace is offered in the preaching of the gospel which therefore is called the glad tidings of peace rom and the ministers of it the embassadors of peace corinthian thirdly the kindes of this peace it is two fold first betweene person and persons secondly betweene person and things the former hath sixe heads i peace betweene man and god the father son and holie ghost properly called reconciliation whereby god in christ is at one with man and man thorough christ at one with god of which when man is once perswaded in his heart then comes this peace rom from which springs another namelie tranquillitie of minde when the mind is quieted in all things that befall without grudging or impatience and that because it is the reuealed will of god philip ii peace with the good angels ephesian for man being at peace with god the angels are become servant and ministring spirits vnto them hebr iii peace with a mans self consisting in two things first when the conscience sanctified ceaseth to accuse and in assurance of god fauour beginneth to take his part to excuse and speake for him before god secondly when the will affections and inclinations submit themselues to the enlightened minde of which if either be wanting man is at war with himselfe and the peace of god ruleth not in his heart coloss iv peace of true beleeuers among themselues who before they beleeued were as lions and cock trise esai but now in the kingdome of christ haue put off that savage nature and become peaceable as act the number of beleeuers were all of one heart v peace of the faithfull with professed enemy namely when they endeuour to haue peace with al man rom not requiting euill with euill vi concord of the enemy themselues with the true church for often the lord restraineth the malice and rage of his enemy and inclines them to peace thus iacob and iosephs familie were preserued in egypt and daniel was brought in fauour with the chiefe eunuch daniel the second branch of this peace is when al things amp creatures conspire and agree for the good of the godly this is called good successe promised psalm whatsoeuer the righteous man doth it shall prosper vse first in that mercie is first asked and then peace wee are by the order taught that peace and good successe are grounded on mercie so as man for the most part take a preposterous course who would haue good successe in health wealth peace honour learning ampc in that they seeke it out of assurance of mercie in the pardon of sin whereas this ground must first bee laid as the foundation of al blessing and good successe secondly we must endeuour that this peace grounded vpon mercie may haue place in our hearts that wee may haue boldnes in regard of god comfort in our consciences peace with our brother quietnes and contentednes in all conditions of life ampc this peace shall preserue our hearts in all things philip this was dauids securitie in the middest of his enemy and danger of death he would now lie downe in peace because the lord did sustaine him psalm verse this grace preserueth the heart vndanted in many afflictions euen as a souldier that takes the enemy ensigne cares for no blowes or wounds so hee may carrie away the ensigne so hee that preserues the peace of god in his heart makes light of afflictions seeing hee holdeth that which counteruaileth all of them the third grace desired in the prayer is loue which is a most excellent vertue preferred corinthian before faith and hope in some respects and made tim the end of the comma dement loue is diuersly taken in the scripture sometime it signifieth the loue of god to the creature and sometime the loue of man to god and man and so it is taken in this place being set after mercie and peace as a fruite of them in the handling of this vertue consider three points in generall before wee come to the speciall parts of it first what this loue is the loue of god and man is a certaine diuine and spirituall motion in the heart causing it to be well pleased in the thing loued and mouing it to affect communion therewith in these two consists the nature of true loue to god and man secondly whence hath loue his beginning a not from nature for the wisedome of the flesh is emnitie with god yes there is in euery mans nature a disposition to hate god and man when occasion is offered let the naturall man say neuer so often he loueth god herein he lieth and deceiueth himselfe for vrge him to frame and conforme himselfe vnto the word wherein he should testifie his loue here his wicked heart hating to be reformed resisteth plainly saying i will not haue this man to rue ouer me i desire none of his waies this loue then comes from grace ioh loue commeth from god tim it hath his beginning from a pure heart true faith and good conscience which must bee maintained against the papists who say that nature affoordeth the inclination but grace the practise whereas indeed grace giueth both thirdly consider the vse of loue it is the instrument and companion of true faith which worketh by loue galath the proper worke of faith is to lay hold on christ this faith as a hand can of it selfe doe but when it commeth to the practise of morall duties it can no more worke without the grace of loue then a hand which can lay hold alone and of it selfe receiue and retaine can cut any thing without an instrument whence it appeareth that faith in iustification is alone but in the life of man it worketh by loue and whereas it hath bin taught for many hundred yeeres that loue is the life of faith that is vn rue for it only testifieth that faith hath life it is alleaged that as the bodie without the spirit is dead euen so faith without workes is dead therfore workes are the soule and giue life to faith but this consequence from this comparison is not good because the soule is not properly the soule of the bodie but of the man and so it proueth not that loue is the soule of faith again the word spirit there betokeneth the breath without which the body is dead and thus is the comparison to be returned that as breath maketh not a man liuing but sheweth him to be aliue so loue maketh not faith liuing but testifieth it so to be yes indeed is the fruite and effect of faith as breath is of life more particularly this grace of loue is two fold first that whereby man loueth god secondly that whereby man loueth man in the former note two points first what it is namely a motion of the heart whereby it is affected to god causing it to be well pleased in god and his workes for himselfe as also to seeke fellowship with god so much as it can secondly note the measure of this loue which in scripture is double first that which the law requireth and that is the full measure of loue loue in the highest degree when man loueth god with all his soule with all his strength and all the powers of the whole man so as in man no loue can be aboue it vnto this all man are bound yet no man since the fall can attaine secondly that which the gospell describeth standing in an vnfained will and true endeuour to loue god with all the heart all the strength and all the powers which is a smaller measure than the former yes and a qualification and moderation of it yet to none but those that are in christ wherby we come to the right vnderstanding of diverse places of scripture as king of iosiah chronicle all iudah sought the lord with their whole hart these and such other places must be vnderstood as they are qualified by the gospell in that they willed and endeuoured by all good meanes to seeke god yes this text also must be vnderstood of this second measure seeing the former being in the highest degree cannot be multiplied no not if man were glorified the second kinde of this loue is that whereby man loueth his neighbour which is a certaine diuine and spirituall motion causing the heart as the former both to be wel pleased in man for god that is because he is god image and his owne flesh as also to powre out it selfe and communicate goodnes to his neighbour in wishing speaking and hoping the best of him wherein by the way obserue a plaine difference betweene faith and loue faith is a hand but to pull christ to our selues loue is a hand also but opening it selfe and giuing foorth vnto others in this loue of the neighbour consider these three things first the order of it the order that hath been taught for many hundred yeeres is that first wee must loue our selues and then others from this ground thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe for the rule say they must goe before the thing ruled but this is not found seeing worthie then haue been commended in scriptures for louing others as well yes and better than their owne selues so dauid loued ionathan sam christ loued his enemy better than himselfe these began not with themselues yes indeed the right beginning of loue is in god and then as a man is a more principall instrument of god glorie hee must be for god preferred in our loue aboue our selues thus euery man is bound to loue and preferre the life of his prince aboue his owne see the perfect rule of direction herein ioh secondly note the manner of it set downe in that precept thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe that is as wee are cheerfull and free to practise the dutie of loue to our selues so must we doe it to others for this precept aimeth at the manner rather than the rule of our loue to man for that is as christ hath loued vs thirdly the kindes of it it is two fold first single when man loue others but are not repaid with loue againe yes when a man loues his enemie but is not loued again the second is mutuall loue that is when loue is requited with loue called in scripture brotherly loue see philip corinthian when man are of one iudgement like minded speak one thing and one soule is as it were in many body the second point is the multiplication of loue which the apostle prayeth for vpon good ground because it ioyneth man to god and man to man and so becommeth as it is called the bond of perfection the bond of the church common wealth amp of al societies corinthian loue ed fieth that is it helpeth to build the kingdome of god yes it constraineth man to all good duties in their particular callings qu but how shall this loue be multiplied ans by certaine meditations and practises the meditations are many first on god comandement be servant one to another in loue gal secondly of god image which al man should beare in loue ioh thirdly of the fellowship of the faithfull hauing all one father one brother one saluation all linked by one spirit ephesian fourthly of the loue of god ioh which hereby we shall be assured of ioh the practises also are diverse first wee must labour to be assured of god loue to vs and encreased vpon vs ephesian secondly the law of nature must teach vs to doe as we would be done vnto thirdly our care must be more to loue than be loued for to loue is a vertue in our selues to be loued i the vertue of another fourthly pray daily for multiplication of loue towards god and man yes towards our enemy seeing the more this is multiplied the happier is our estate yes and the condition of the church vpon earth verse beloued when i gaue diligence to write vnto you of the common saluation it was needfull for me to write vnto you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once giuen vnto the saints here begins the second part of this epistle which is the exhortation reaching to the end of the verse in this verse two things are contained first the causes which mooued the apostle to write the epistle secondly the matter of his exhortation the causes of his writing are three first his loue noted in the word beloued secondly his readie and willing minde of himselfe noted in the word diligence which signifieth a carefull endeuour and studie to doe the church good and it is enlarged by three arguments first in that he gaue all diligence and not some part onely to further the church secondly when hee could not speake to y e catholike church he gaue diligence to write thirdly he writeth not of small matters but of things most weightie such as concern their saluation against which seeing it might be obiected that he was not able to write of such a weightie matter hee therefore calles it common saluation to cut oft that surmise as also to shew that it is common to himselfe and the whole church of which therefore hauing a share therein he is not ignorant the third cause in the word needfull a necessitie was laid vpon him in that he was called to bee an apostle and so bound to further the saluation of the catholike church out of these three motiues which caused the apostle to write obserue first that euery minister that would deliuer the word faithfully must haue three things to excite him thereto first loue towards the church to which he is called secondly a readie minde to further the saluation of their soules thirdly the bond of his calling stirring him vp to faithfulnes and diligence all these three concurred in paul first his loue appeared corinthian secondly his readie minde was not wanting philip thirdly for his calling that vrged him see corinthian note hence also that whosoeuer would heare the word or reade it to saluation must bring three things in his heart first a loue to the word deliuered this caused dauid often to muse thereupon psalm secondly a readie and diligent minde to receiue and reteine it this was in the bereans act and in the galathians when they receiued paul as an angell of god gal thirdly a consideration of the great necessitie of hearing and reading the word prou where vision failes people perish thirdly in this example of the apostle all pastors must learne diligence in all good meanes for the furtherance of the saluation of their flock for which cause they are called watchmen because they are to watch ouer their soules yes sauiours obadiah to put them in minde that they are to bothe meanes of sauing man they had no need then be entangled with many charges and other businesses fourthly as the apostle writeth of the common saluation of which he hath good experience so euery minister must see that he haue experience in himselfe of that he teacheth others and haue a taste of that in his owne heart which he would haue others seasoned withall els his teaching shall be cold the second part of this verse is the exhortation the whole matter and substance may be reduced to three heads first that faith is a notable treasure which hath many enemy secondly that the saints are the keepers of it thirdly that the office of euery member of the catholike church is to hold and maintaine this treasure for the first that faith is a treasure appeareth pet where it is called pretious faith corinthian a treasure in earthly vessels and by this that a fight is here inioyned against the enemy of it for the cleering of which consider two things first what it is secondly who be the enemy of it against whom we must fight and them we shal ioyntly obserue with the seueral grouds of faith for the first this faith is nothing els but y e holesome doctrine of the gospel called by paul to titus the truth according to godlines so tim this faith which many shall denie is opposed to the doctrine of diuels now for our more orderly proceeding wee must consider that this doctrine of faith admitteth a distinction which paul himselfe maketh corinthian some doctrines are of the foundation without which religion cannot stand such as are set downe hebr others pertaine to the foundation but are not of it as gold and siluer built vpon the foundation it shall not be amisse here to stand a while to set downe the holesome doctrine of saluation which is fundamentall reduced by the apostle to two generall heads faith and loue the wholesome doctrine of faith containes things needfull to be beleeued the wholesome doctrine of loue containes things necessarily to be practised and both these are expresly set downe in scripture as wee shall s ew in their order first that all the doctrine of the prophets and apostles giuen by diuine inspiration tim all scripture is giuen by diuine inspiration that is all the doctrine both for matter stile and words of scripture is deliuered by the inspiration of the holy ghost hence it followeth that all scripture is authenticall as hauing the authoritie from god yes and must be beleeued as if god from heauen should speake without disputation or calling any part of it into question this ground must first be laid if it be said the scripture may be prooued by reason and by the generall consent of the church ans that is vntrue for reason cannot settle the conscience to beleeue in any point but scripture telleth there is a god which reason prooueth ans reason out of nature teacheth there is a god but by the word of god only i doe beleeue it inducements to faith may be brought out of nature but god word onely causeth true beliefe secondly for the authoritie of the church i beleeue not because the church saith so but because the scripture saith it and the church i beleeue so farre as she consents with the word and speaketh out of it first the turkes and turkish religion who denie scripture to bee giuen by inspiration and denie the bookes of the prophets and apostles and in stead of them stand to their alcaran secondly the iewes who refuse the bookes of the new testament thirdly the atheist who will beleeue nothing of all this fourthly the painted aduersarie the papist who vndermines this ground first saying that the hebrew and greeke text is corrupted so as wee may not build vpon it that thereby they might bring their latin bible into credit as most authentic and yet that they might make the sentence of their church the rule of faith the most learned of al that church hold that the latin bible is also corrupt so indeede they couertly renounce all scripture that the sentence of the church may obtaine the chiefe stroke secondly in teaching that the authoritie of the church in regarde of vs is aboue the scriptures because wee knowe not the sense thereof but by the church thus putting downe the true and principall ground of scripture that they might more easily set vp their own dotages the second ground concerneth the sufficiencie of scripture and is this the scripture of the prophets and apostles is a perfect rule of faith and manners it is of all things to be beleeued or done to saluation tim the scripture is profitable to teach improue correct instruct in righteousnes to make the man of god absolute yes perfect in euery good worke if it make him perfect in al kind of teaching it is also able much more to make euery man perfect to all the duties of his calling gal if an angell should teach otherwise that is diverse or besides though not contrary to that which is taught hee shall bee accursed many doctrines indeed of artes and other things are diverse and besides it but the meaning is that no doctrine of saluation must be brought no not besides it therfore the bookes of the prophets and apostles containe a perfect rule many things which cannot bee found in scripture may be supplied by tradition ans traditions can neuer settle the conscience for though diverse of them are found in the writings of the fathers yet they were subiect to error and so might and did erre in them first all man by nature iob who say to the almightie departe from vs for wee desire not the knowledge of thy waies yes our common protestant who in iudgement acknowledge this rule yet in their life they leaue it and take the leaden rule of naturall reason sense sight and feeling and few there be that liue by faith secondly the roman church for first they make the written word a thing ruled by setting vp another rule saying that there are two kindes of scripture the first is inward written in the heart of all catholikes which is the vniuersall consent of the church the second is outward written by the prophets and apostles an inken scripture say they and a dead letter without the former whereas the cleane contrarie is true the true rule being the scripture of the prophets and apostles and the other in the heart in this life but an imperfect patterne drawne according to the former secondly they ouerturne the ground in ioyning to the written word vnwritte tra tions so making it but half a rule and indeed as good no rule but where are these traditions in the writings of fathers they say but how shall we know them to be scripture because the fathers say so but how shall wee know they say true here must they flie to man whereof yet no man can assure vs thirdly in teaching that the true sense of scripture cannot be found without the churches determination and so indeede make it no rule because a right rule both ruleth it selfe and is plaine to rule other things also the third ground is there is one true god by one i meane one in number not two corinthian to vs there is but one god that is to the church to vs that looke to bee saued which is plaine by this reason for there can be but one infinite and if there were two or moe god there should be two or moe infinites which is impossible first the common protestant who in iudgment holdeth one god yet in heart and life he setteth vp two or moe some riches some pleasure some one sinne or other for where a mans heart is there is his god paul saith some make their bellie their god and that the diuell is the god of the world secondly the maine enemie is the popish church which in word holdeth one god but diverse waies set vp diverse god as first the pope himselfe who by their reformed canon law is to iudge all and to be iudged of none who maketh himselfe a forgiuer of sinnes and that properly yes a maker of lawes to binde conscience aswell as god lawes which is horrible blasphemie secondly the virgin mary whom they make a goddesse as christ a god as christ a king so her a queene as he a lord so her a ladie yes they set christ below her whom they desire to commaund her son by the right of a mother yes and in some of their reformed seruice bookes they trust in her for saluation thirdly the saints whom they pray vnto wherein they attribute vnto them the knowledge of the secrets of mens hearts and omnipresence for they must also be in all places which are things proper vnto god alone the fourth ground is that god is all sufficient in himselfe gen i am all sufficient that is he hath in himselfe all perfection for first he taketh being from none but giueth being to all secondly for substance he is a spirit of perfect nature thirdly euery way infinite in regard of time place attributes this may well be called a ground for whosoeuer placeth any want or imperfection in god denieth god and maketh him no god first the common people who conceiue a god made all of mercie without his iustice secondly the papist who robbeth god of his perfection two waies first they attribute an imperfect iustice vnto him namely such a one as may be satisfied by mans satisfaction secondly an imperfect mercie whereof our own merits must make a supplie teaching that indeed christ must make vs iust but we must make our selues more iust and merit saluation the fifth ground is there be three in heauen the father son and holy ghost and th se three are one god ioh how can it be that three are one god ans it is a mysterie which the ancient church answered thus they be three in person and one in substance so wee also say they be three in manner of subsisting but one in nature and godhead three they be distinguished in person the father not being the son nor the holy ghost and so in the other persons subsistences in one nature ioh this is life euerlasting ampc this is a groud because wee must worship one god in three persons neither can wee aright thinke of god out of the trinitie first heretikes innumerable whose memorie is accursed as arians of former and later times denying the godhead of christ secondly the turke and iew who hold an absolute god out of the persons thirdly our common people who pray to such a god in their owne names out of the son and holie ghost fourthly the popish church which denieth by their doctrine the three persons for hee that denieth the son denieth the father and holy ghost ioh now they denie the son both in his natures abolishing his manhood in their doctrine of the sacrament as also his offices of king priest and prophet for which we must vtterly separate from them the sixth ground is that nothing commeth to passe without the special decree will and prouidence of god matth a sparrow falleth not to the ground without his will ob sinne is against god will and therefore commeth to passe without his will ans that which is against the will of god is not without his will quest how can this be ans no sinne commeth to passe but god decreeth the permitting and being of it now to permit sinne and the being of it is neither the causing of sinne nor the doing of it but the not hindring of it to which he is not bound this ground being denied chance will be brought in and god himselfe denied the seuenth ground is that god hath chosen some man before the world was to be partakers of the riches of his mercies and passed by others because it was his will roman he will haue mercie on whom he will ephesian pet some are a chosen generation and therfore some are not chosen againe whom he will he hardeneth he hideth the mysteries of the kingdome from some why because his pleasure was such matth and of this there is good reason for in nature the first cause ordereth the second causes and not the second the first now god will is cause of all causes which therefore must rule all as the supreme and not be ruled by any other that this is a ground appeareth tim the foundation of god remaineth sure the lord knoweth who are his and indeede none other can bee the ground of grace and happines vnto vs than the counsaile of god in electing vs called therefore of the apostle a foundation first our common people that thus abuse this doctrine if i be chosen to saluation i shall be saued therefore i may liue as i list they might as well reason thus the tearme of my life is stinted none can lengthen or shorten it i will therefore neither eate nor drink nor vse physicke nor other meanes of prolonging my daies which what were it else but to murther the bodie so these from the same ground become murtherers of their soules whereas man chosen to the end will prease after the meanes and conclude otherwise and say i will vse meanes that i may come to life secondly others more learned are aduersaries to this ground who teach that god for his part hath chosen all man to life and for his part would haue all saued and that christ for his part hath redeemed all and the holy ghost giueth or offereth grace to all if wee aske why then are not all saued they answere because god foresawe those who would beleeue whom hee appointed to saluation he foresaw also others who would not beleeue and adiudged them to damnation but by this doctrine shall god will hang on the will of man and bee ruled by it seeing hee would haue man saued but man will not and so this ground is in part rased the eighth ground is that god made the heauens and the earth and all things that haue being in them column by him were created all things which are in heauen and in earth this is a principle for if creatures had no beginning then are they become god which would ouerthrow the godhead but all things were not made besides god for the highest heauen the throne of god is eternall as god himselfe is ans the throne of god is a creature as well as the rest heb he looked for a citie hauing a foundation whose builder and maker is god in the world are many euils which could not be from god the foundation of all goodnesse ans euill is of three sorts first naturall which commeth by nature corrupted as sicknes diseases plagues and death it selfe secondly materiall euils as hurtfull beast poisons in trees plants beast these are created and the very poison of them is a creature thirdly morali euils which be trasgressions against the morall law and commandement of god of the two former god is the author and cause esai i create euill that is naturall and materiall but of the third that is morall euils which be sinne god is no cause ob but god is the cause of all things and sinne is some thing ans sin is no creature but the destruction of god image which is a creature effected by the creature for though the creature cannot make a creature yet it can destroy a creature the aduersarie to this ground is the atheist who holdeth the creatures to haue been from euerlasting and so by denying one god hee maketh manie thousands the ground is that god made man according to his owne image gen for by creation man had three things first the substance of bodie and soule secondly in them the powers and faculties of minde will affections ampc thirdly an excellent conformitie of all these to the will of god this is the image of god called in the scripture righteousnes and holinesse this is a ground for the image of god is the substance and body of the law hee therefore that denieth this denieth the law the fall from it and restoring vnto it by christ the ground is that by adam sinne and death entred into the world and in him all meere man sinned rom to the conceauing of which wee must know that the first sinne of adam was eating the forbidden fruite the next was the putting out of god image in stead of which corruption of heart tooke place so farre as the seede of all sinne being within him he was prone and readie to euery sinne now adam being a publike person and hauing receiued whatsoeuer hee had for himselfe and his posteritie either to hold for or lose from both hence is it that both those sinnes are become the two first sinnes in our conception he sinning wee sinned and with him haue the seed of all sin within vs by nature no sinne excepted no not the sinne against the holy ghost yes no otherwise is it with vs than with a noble man practising treason whose whole blood is therby stained ob but christ came of adam therefore he in adam sinned ans god made this law with adam that all who came of him by ordinarie generation should be guiltie of his sinne but christ was extraordinarily conceiued by the holy ghost and took of mary adams nature but not adams sinne againe christ came of adam but from him as a beginning and not by him as by a father whereas all other man are both from adam and by him this is a maine ground of our religion without which there could bee no redemption first our common people who say they euer kept god law and loued him with al their heart and their neighbours as themselues and thinke hence all is well but were it so as they dreame they had neuer fallen in adam and so adams sin had not gone ouer all man secondly the popish church first in teaching that the virgin mary who came of adam by ordinary generation was conceiued without sinne notwithstanding she was saued not by her bearing of christ in her wombe but by beleeuing on him with her heart secondly in that they teach that man are not wholy dead in sinne but in part or halfe dead yes that being a little holpen they can keepe the law as though by sinne man had not been wholy depriued of the glorie of god the ground is that the law and gospell are two parts of the word of god and are diverse kindes of doctrine by the law i vnderstand that part of god word which promiseth life to the obeyer by the gospell that part which promiseth it to the beleeuer these i say are diverse kindes of doctrine to the cleering of which consider first their consent and agreement secondly their dissent and difference first the law and gospell consent first in the author of both which is god secondly in their generall matter for both require iustice and righteousnesse to saluation thirdly in their end namely the glorie of god secondly they dissent in sixe things first the morall law is written in nature by creation yes and since the fall we haue some remainder of it in vs rom the gentiles shew the effect of the law written in their hearts but the gospell is not in nature but aboue the reach of nature created much more corrupted the ground of the law is the image of god but the ground of the gospell is iesus christ secondly the law will haue vs doe something that we may be saued by it and that is to fulfill it the gospel requireth no doing of vs but onely beleeuing in christ ob but beleeuing is a worke to be done ans the gospell requireth it not as a worke but as it is an instrument and the hand of the soule to lay hold vpon christ rom and and hence is it that the law requireth righteousnes inherent but the gospell imputed thirdly the law is propounded to the vnrepentant sinner to bring him to faith but the gospell to the beleeuer to the begetting and increase of faith fourthly the law sheweth sinne accuseth and reuealeth iustice without mercie but the gospell couereth sinne and is a qualification of the rigour of the law the law saith cursed is euery one ampc the gospell qualifieth that and saith except he beleeue and repent euery man is accursed thus the law which onely manifesteth iustice is moderated by the gospell which mingleth mercie and iustice together iustice vpon christ mercie vnto vs fiftly the law telleth vs what good workes must bee done the gospell how they must bee done the former declareth the matter of our obedience the latter directeth vs in the manner of obeying the former is pleased with nothing but the deede the latter signifieth that god is pleased to accept the will and vnfained endeuor for the deede it selfe sixtly the law is no worker of grace and saluation no not instrumentally for it is the ministerie of death the gospell preached worketh grace onely though the law may be a hammer to breake the heart and prepare the way to faith and repentance the papists who hold that they are one doctrine only but herein differing that the law is more darke the gospell more plaine the former more hard to fulfill the latter more easie that is as the roote of a tree this as the bodie amp branches by which premises they would conclude christ to be no sauiour but an instrumet rather for vs to saue our selues by he giuing vs grace to keepe the law for a sinner must needes bee saued by works if there be no difference between the law and the gospell and if the law which requireth workes were not moderated by the gospel which requireth not workes but faith the ground is the word was made flesh ioh this is a maine ground as in ioh euery spirit that doth not confesse that christ is come in the flesh that is euery doctrine in which christ is denied to be come in the flesh is not of god but of antichrist now by word i vnderstand the eternall son of god the second person in trinitie the very substantiall word of the father it is added was made not as though the son of god was turned into flesh and ceased to bee god son but as heb in that he tooke not the seede of angels but of abraham the meaning then is that the son of god abiding still the word tooke that is receiued into his person our nature philipp he tooke vpon him the forme of a servant the word flesh signifieth first mans nature which christ tooke vnto him namely a true nature of man not phantasticall or apparant onely secondly the whole nature of man consisting of true and perfect soule and bodie with all things that belong to the entire nature of man for if he had taken mans nature only in part he had redeemed it but in part thirdly the properties of man in soule minde will affections in body breadth length circumscription ampc fourthly the infirmities and frailties of mans nature without sin where must be noted that christ tooke not all infirmities of mans nature as sin and corruption neither euery personall infirmitie of euery person as blindnes gowte or this and that particular disease here by the way it may be asked whether christ had obliuion in his agonie as some haue thought to which may be answered that euen whe he vttered those words father if it be thy will let this cup ampc it is not fit to attribute obliuion vnto him which properly is a forgetfulnes of those things which we are bound to remember for thus wee should draw sinne vpon him but rather to ascribe it to suspending of the memorie which is when a man neither forgetteth nor remembreth for as in the will be three things willing nilling suspending of the will which is neither of the former so also is it in memorie which remembreth forgetteth and suspendeth memorie for a time now the summe of the whole ground is that the son of god the second person and so abiding tooke vnto him the perfect nature of man in all things being like vnto vs sinne onely excepted for the further cleering of which consider these foure conclusions first the son of god made man is not two persons distinct but one alone quest how can this be for as he is the son of god he is a person and as he is a man he is a particular person as euery seuerall man is and therefore hee is two persons ans euery particular man is a person because he subsisteth of himselfe but the manhood of christ subsisteth not in it selfe but in the second person onely so that christ god and man is but one person for euen as body and soule make one man so godhead and manhood make but one christ secondly this one person consisteth of two distinct natures the godhead and the manhood standing of bodie and soule thirdly these two natures are vnited and ioyned into one person for the godhead doth take the manhood and support it fourthly these two natures after coniunction remaine distinct the godhead is not the manhood neither on the contrary but still distinguished first in regard of themselues secondly of their properties for the properties of the one are not the properties of the other thirdly of their actions for the actions of the godhead are not communicated to the manhood neither is the worke of one nature the worke of another first heretikes innumerable which are not knowne to all but knowne enemy are first jewes who denie christ to come in the flesh secondly some jewish arrians compounded heretikes who haue withstood christs incarnation some of which haue suffered amongst vs thirdly the papists the substance of whose doctrine robbeth christ of his humane nature though they confesse him incarnate for since his death they teach his bodie is become inuisible and in innumerable places at once so they abolish the manhood of christ and turne it into the godhead seeing it is become infinite and vncircumscribed ob they alleage god can make it to be in many places at once ans we may not dispute what god can doe but what he will doe so farre as he hath reuealed secondly it stands not with the power of god to doe some things as those which imploy contradictions to be true at the same time of which nature this is to make a true bodie to be in many places at once yes to be in heauen and also euery where on earth but his bodie is glorified and therefore may be in many places at once ans the words this is my bodie were spoken before his glorification secondly glorification taketh away the corruption but not the true properties of his bodie as length breadth thicknes and circumscription ob but things ioyned together must be in the same place and cannot be seuered and therefore his manhood being ioyned to his godhead must needes be euery where ans the antecedent is false for things ioyned together may bee the one in one place the other in another as the bodie of the sun is ioyned with his beames and light and yet the bodie of the sun is in heauen but the beames and light in the earth also the ground is that iesus is christ ioh who is a lier but he that denieth that iesus is christ the same is the antichrist from which place wee may gather two thinges first that iesus is christ secondly that it is a ground susteyning our whole saluation for whosoeuer denieth it is antichrist see corinthian the meaning of the ground by christ i vnderstand the annointed sauiour and redeemer who is a king priest and prophet first as he is a king his power manifesteth it selfe in three thinges first in sauing and destroying not the body onely as other kinges but the soule also secondly in pardoning sinnes or reteyning them thirdly in making lawes to bind consciences secondly his priestly office standeth in two thinges first in a power to offer sacrifice propitiatorie for the sinnes of whole mankind secondly in making intercession to god for mankind thirdly his propheticall office consisteth in three thinges first in reuealing to man the will of his father secondly in enlightining of the mind to vnderstand that will reuealed thirdly in framing of the harte to performe obedience vnto it together with the setling of it in the truth thus he is the christ that is the annoynted of god but we must yet here goe further and vnderstand by christ a perfect christ a perfect redeemer without any partner fellow or deputy for if hee haue a partner he is but halfe a redeemer and if he haue a fellow or deputy how is he omnipotent or omnipresent this is plaine by testimonie of scripture there is none other name actes therefore there is no fellow or partner there is one mediatour that is but one tim yes by himselfe he purged our sinnes heb without fellow or deputy whose priesthood is such as cannot passe from himselfe to another heb obiect but ministers haue power to remit and retaine sinne hauing the keyes giuen them answer the keyes are not giuen to ministers to pardon man properly but ministerially to pronounce and declare that god in heauen doth pardon them ob the saints shall iudge the world and therfore not christ onely answer they shall not iudge by pronouncing a soueraigne sentence of absolution or condemnation which is proper to christ the iudge but by assisting him as iustices vpon the bench both by witnessing and assenting vnto that righteous iudgement obiect psalm he is annoynted with oyle of gladnes aboue his fellowes therefore hee hath fellowes answer all that beleeue in christ are the fellowes of christ but in his annoynting that is in grace though not in office obiect but ministers are christs deputies an ministers are properly no deputies but instruments to declare the will of god and can go no further then to teach the eare for it is christ himselfe that enlighteneth the mind but it will bee said that kinges are christs deputies on earth answer they are his deputies as hee is god equall to his father not as hee is mediatour the roman church who rob christ of all these three offices for first his kingly office they giue part of it to the pope in making him to remit sinnes properly to make lawes to bind conscience properly as god lawes do which is a power equall to christs amp so they make him check mate with christ secondly his priestly office is giuen to the masse priest who by their doctrine hath power to offer a propitiatorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and dead ye euery papist hath a peece of it because euery one of them may satisfie the iustice of god for hi sins by his owne merit and for his intercession the secod work of his priesthood that is dealt among the saints among whom the virgin mary hath the greatest part who are inuocated as intercessors not onely by their prayers but by their merits in heauen thirdly his propheticall office is bestowed likewise vpon euery pope who is without scripture to determine infallibly by an inward assistance of the spirit locked vp in his breast of all matters concerning faith amp manners which is the proper office of him who is the proper doctor of his church therefore this roman doctrine established by the councell of trent is an hereticall and antichristian doctrine making god an idoll god which is concluded out of the place alleaged thus he that denieth iesus to be christ is antichrist and againe he that hath not the son hath not the father but the roman church denie iesus to be christ and hath not the son because it ouerturneth his person and oppugneth all his offices and therfore neither haue they the father but an idoll god and so consequently their doctrine is antichristian and hereticall for which cause the reformed churches haue iustly separated from them and ought euer so long as they denie this ground so to doe the ground is he that beleeueth in christ shall not perish but haue life euerlasting ioh god so loued the world ampc for the better handling of it consider first for the meaning what this faith is secondly that it is a maine ground of true religion thirdly the enemy of it for the first in this faith are two things first knowledge secondly application of the thing knowne the knowledge is of christ and his benefits of which some measure must be had or else there can be no faith esay by his knowledge shall my righteous servant iustifie many ioh this is life eternall ampc and this stands with reason that the thing to bee beleeued must first bee knowne for faith without knowledge is fancie the romane church hath then erred which teach that there is a faith to saluation whereto knowledge is not required such a one as standeth only in an assent to the faith of the church the second thing in faith which is the more principall is an application of things knowne namely of christ and his benefits vnto our selues in particular and herein standeth the very substance of true faith which is not caused by any naturall affection of heart or action of will but by the supernaturall action of the minde enlightened by the spirit of god resoluing vs that christ and his merits belong vnto vs in particular that this true particular application is required in true faith is proued by these reasons first that which wee lawfully aske by prayer wee must beleeue by a speciall faith but in prayer we lawfully aske the pardon of our sinnes in particular and life euerlasting by christ therefore we must beleeue the pardon of our sinnes and life euerlasting by christ the aduersaries can denie nothing but the first part of this reason which is the very word of god it selfe mark whatsoeuer ye desire when you pray beleeue yee shall haue it and it shall be done vnto you where in euery petition of prayer our sauiour requireth two things first a desire of things promised secondly a particular faith of things desired standing in assurance that they shall be granted secondly whatsoeuer the holie ghost doth infallibly testifie to vs particularly that wee must beleeue particularly but the holy ghost doth particularly testifie by infallible testimonie to euery beleeuers conscience his owne adoption and pardon of sinne and acceptance to life euerlasting and therefore it must be particularly beleeued here the papist excepteth and saith that this testimonie of the spirit of god is not certain but probable onely and a man may be deceiued in it but the apostle rom answereth this allegation the spirit of god testifieth with our spirits that we are the children of god and cleereth this testimonie of fearfulnes and weaknes in the former words where he saith it is not the spirit of feare which wee haue receiued but such a spirit as maketh vs cri abba father and with a strong voyce yes and for the further assuring vs in this testimonie it is called the corinthian s ale and earnest penny of the spirit in our hearts than which things what are more sure and certain ratifications among man whose testimony though it be but of two man but much more of three seale or earnest if it be sufficient confirmatio vnto man how much more sure is the testimonie seale and earnest of the spirit of god vnto vs thirdly that which god offereth and giueth vs particularly we must particularly receiue but god offereth and giueth vs christ and all his benefits particularly in the word amp sacraments and therefore wee must haue particular faith to receiue him it will here be said we grant all this we must receiue christ and his benefits in speciall but we doe it by hope as the papists reach to hope well ans it is a work of faith alone ioh as many as receiued him ampc who were they the next words shew euen they that beleeued on his name againe in the sacrament of the supper christ is offered as the bread and water of life to euery one in particular and therefore euery beleeuer must haue something in his soule proportionall to a hand and mouth for the receiuing and feeding vpon him which is nothing else but faith specially applying christ and his benefits see ioh fourthly the example of beleeuers in the scriptures prooue the same truth abraham beleeued by a particular faith which was imputed to him for righteousnes rom so also paul galat i liue by the faith of the son of god who loued me and hath giuen himselfe for me now both these are patternes and presidents for vs to follow that as they beleeued and particularly applied christ to themselues so must we see rom timoth now fro these two namely knowledge and application followeth confidence whereby wee trust and relie our selues vpon christ and his merits thus knowne and applied vnto saluation which because it inseparably followeth faith is often in the scripture put for faith it selfe i distinguish it from faith because it hath been said though falsely that it is a part of faith which indeed is a fruite and a follower of faith and the apostle ephesian doth manifestly distinguish them by whom we haue boldnes and entrance with confidence by faith in him the second point in this ground is the weight of it that it is a maine ground of religion appeareth thus if the inheritance of life saith paul be not by faith it is not s re rom for if we were intitled by workes the promise should not be certaine he then that oppugneth this ground of particular faith ouerthroweth the gospel as which cannot assure a man of saluation secondly in the catechisme of the primitiue church faith in god is made one groud heb thirdly this ground being the most maine promise of the gospell whosoeuer ouerthroweth it hee depriueth man of all comfort of religion the aduersaries of this ground are first the common people who for the most part professe that they are not certaine of the pardon of their sinnes they hope well because god is merciful but to be certaine they thinke it impossible as though there can bee hope and confidence where is no assurance but speciall hope alwaies presupposeth speciall faith secondly the papists for they condemne speciall faith for these reasons first where is no word there say they can be no particular faith but there is no word that saith thou cornelius peter john ampc shalt be saued ans it is true indeede there is no particular faith where there is no particular word or which is proportionall but the minister truly applying the generall promise to this amp that particular man it is as much as if a mans name were registred in the scripture secondly wee haue in substance a particular word in that god who hath giuen the promise hath giuen also a commandement to euery beleeuer to applie the same vnto himselfe ioh this is his commandement that we beleeue in the name of his son iesus christ which is equiualent to a particular word as a king giues a pardon to a thousand man but nameth neuer one of them yet euery of them trulie applying the pardon according to the kings intention haue the benefit of it as surely as if all their names had bin set therein ii obiect many that applie the generall promise to themselues are deceiued and faile yes euery wicked man saith he beleeueth in the son of god wherein he is deceiued ans many indeede faile in their speciall application but it is onely vnbeleeuers but they must proue that none truly can applie the promise speciallie which all true beleeuers doe iii obiect they say in regard of god wee must beleeue but in regard of our selues we must doubt ans yes in regard of our selues wee must not onely doubt but despaire yet beleeuers being found not in themselues but in christ may proue themselues whether they are in the faith or no corinthian for whosoeuer repenteth knoweth that he doth repent we know we are of god ioh ob but all man in the world are full of doubting and how can doubting stand with certaintie of saluation ans consider faith first as it is in it selfe so it is certaine secondly as it is in vs amp so it is mingled with much doubting which is not of the nature of faith but contrary vnto it and yet these may and must stand together in the beleeuer for doubtings may disturbe but not destroy true faith for the lord notwithstanding them accepteth our weak faith as perfect and our will to beleeue for beleefe it selfe where he seeth griefe conceiued for doubtings strife against them and endeuour to haue our faith increased ob but to beleeue pardon of our sinnes is to enter into god counsell ans that is false because pardon of our sinnes is reueiled ob but your church say they abhorreth reuelation answer neither the scripture nor our church condemneth reuelations contained in the scripture but those that are without beside or against scripture ephesian the spirit is called the spirit of reuelation see also corinthian as for this reuelation of pardon of sinne to the beleeuer it is contained in the scripture and is no more a prying into god counsell than it is for a traytour to beleeue that he is pardoned when certaine newes of his pardon is brought vnto him from the king of whom none can say he entreth into the kings counsell hence we conclude that seeing the doctrine of the papists ouerthrow this maine ground wee must take heede of ioyning our selues vnto them the ground is that a sinner is iustified by faith without the workes of the law rom wherein consider first the meaning secondlie the weight thirdly the aduersaries for the meaning three things must bee knowne first what it is to be iustified secondly what it is to bee iustified by faith thirdly what workes are to bee excluded from iustification concerning the first in iustification there be three distinct actions of god first the freeing of a sinner from his sins for the merits of christ act from all things from which they could not be iustified by the law of moses by him euery one that beleeueth is iustified that is acquited from them paul opposeth it thus to condemnation rom which is nothing else but a binding of a man to iust punishment the second action is the reputing and the accepting of a sinner as iust for the merit of christ esay woe vnto him that iustifieth a wicked man that is not to make but accept him iust and in the gospell wisedome is iustified of her children that is approoued and acknowledged the third is the acceptation of a sinner to life euerlasting in christ for after that god hath absolued a sinner and reputed him as iust there must follow this acceptation to life which is therfore called the iustificatio of life with the reason rendred in the same place for that like as adams sinne is imputed vnto all by which death entred so christs obedience imputed to beleeuers bringeth life and iustification out of which three actions wee may gather a true description of iustification to wit it is an action of god the father absoluing a sinner from all his sinnes for the merit of christ accounting him as iust and accepting him to life euerlasting ii point what it is to be iustified by faith for the cleer vnderstanding of this waighty point we must answere questions first what is the very thing for which a sinner is iustified ans it is the obedience of christ the redeemer and mediatour passiue and actiue the former standing in suffering the death of his bodie and the paines of the second death in his soule the latter in fulfilling the law the truth of this answer appeareth thus since our fall we owe to god a double debt we breake the law and are bound to make satisfaction secondly being creatures wee must fulfill the rigour of the law and performe what it requireth neither parcell of which debt seeing we being bankcrupts are able to pay wee flie to our suertie who must pay both for vs the former hee doth by his death being made a curse for vs and so redeemed vs from the curse galath the latter by perfect obedience vnto the law that so in him wee doing these things might liue in them verse the second question is seeing the obedience of christ is the matter of our iustification and is out of our selues how commeth it to bee made ours ans to make it ours first god must giue it vs secondly wee must receiue it first god giueth it vnto vs when he giueth vs christ himselfe for it is giuen with him and it is made ours when god in mercie esteemeth iudgeth and accounteth it to be ours for it is ours by imputation which appeareth by these two reasons first as christ is made out sinne so are we made his righteousnes corinthian but hee is made our sinne by imputation and therefore his iustice being inheret in him is made ours by imputation secondly as the first adams disobedience is made ours so christs the second adams obedience is ours rom but that is ours by imputation and therefore christs obedience also secondly to make this obedience ours we must receiue it and that can be onely by faith which is the hand of the soule receiuing into it the things that are giuen vs of god where note by the way that a sinner is not iustified by the dignitie of his faith but as it is an instrument whereby christs obedience is applied vnto the soule iii point what workes are excluded from iustification ans the workes of morall and ceremoniall law workes of nature and grace that euen workes of grace are excluded appeareth by these reasons first a sinner must so bee iustified that all cause of boasting may be cut off rom but if a man were iustified by workes of grace he might boast still yes though hee acknowledge the workes to be of god see the pharisies example luke secondly if a man were iustified by the workes of the law then our iustification should stand by the law but that it doth not rom for then the promise were made voide yes the tenour of that whole chapter prooueth that abraham hauing store of good workes was yet iustified by faith without the works of the law the which thing also that obiection in chap witnesseth what then shall we continue in sinne drawne out of the fiue former chapters thus if a man may be iustified by faith without workes we may continue in sinne which obiection were no obiection if that had not been the intent of the apostle to prooue iustification by faith onely without the workes of the law thirdly paul was not iustified by any workes corinthian i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not therby iustified where he noteth two things of himselfe first that hee had a good conscience within him secondly that he was not thereby iustified where hee debarreth all works of grace fourthly we are saued by grace without workes these workes excluded are workes of grace for they are all such as god hath prepared to walke in ephesian fiftly a man must first be iustified before he can doe a good worke and therfore works follow iustification and cannot cause it yes and as all workes are excluded so al vertues also excepting faith are here reiected for as in a man that standeth to receiue a gift no part doth any thing to receiue it but the hand yet hauing receiued it all other parts testifie thankfulnes the tongue the feete and all the bodie euen so wee receiue the matter of our iustification by faith alone not by hope or loue but after the receiuing of christ these with the other graces work and shew themselues the second point in this ground is the weight of it appearing herein that he that ouerthroweth it ouerturneth the faith rom if they of the law be he res of life faith is made voide and the promise of none effect and galath if we be iustified by workes christ died in vaine aduersaries hereof first the home aduersarie is the common sort of ignorant people and all naturall man who with the young man say what shall i doe to be saued they say they will be saued by faith in christ but when it commeth to the point they will be doing somewhat and stand much vpon their good meaning and righteous dealing secondly the forreine enemie is the popish doctrine amp roman religion which teacheth that there be two iustifications first when a man of an evil man is made a good man this is by grace of the holy ghost put into the heart the latter is whereby a man is made of good better which is by good workes but what church soeuer holdeth this is fallen from grace this is a peremptorie sentence will some say and no generall councell hath so determined ans the more is the pitie but god word hath peremptorily determined it galat they are abolished from christ and fallen from grace whosoeuer will be iustified by the law as the romane church at this day they say our doctrine maintaineth loosenes of life by excluding all workes from iustification ans though we exclude the best works from iustification yet we debarre them not from christian conuersation but therein require them as fruits of the spirit plentifully ob but it is absurd say they that one man may be iustified by the righteousnes of another ans adams sinne is made ours and they marueile not at it what greater absurditie is it that the second adams obedience answering to the first adams sinne should bee ours in like manner the ground is this except a man be borne anew of water and of the hol e ghost he cannot enter into the kingdome of god ioh in which obserue first the meaning secondly the weight thirdly the aduersaries in the first consider two points first what it is to be borne againe secondly of what necessitie it is for the former wee must know that there must bee in him that is borne againe three things first a reall change from one estate to another secondly there must be a roote from whence this change may arise thirdly a new life first the chaunge is when a man of a meere naturall man is made a new man not in regard of his bodie or soule or powers of them all which a man retaineth the same after his regeneration but in regard of god image restored and renewed by christ ephesian this is the restoring of that new qualitie of righteousnes and holines lost in adam for so the apostle describeth this new birth in the place alleaged this change is attributed to water and the holy ghost wherein by water our sauiour alludeth to some speeches of the old testament as ezech where the prophet speaketh of the clensing of the church by powring cleane water vpon it that is infusing new graces into the heart which take place of the old corruption and by the holy ghost he sheweth that this clensing of vs is by the inward working of the holy ghost obiect but it will be said if a man bee a new man hee must haue a new soule ans this new qualitie of righteousnes and holines is as it were a new soule for in a regenerate man there is a bodie soule and besides the spirit which is the grace of sanctification opposed to flesh and corruption of nature rom this is as it were the soule of a soule renewed secondly that a man may come to this estate there must be some root and beginning whence this change may arise and that is no other than christ crucified the redeemer and mediatour of whose bodie beleeuers are members of his flesh and of his bones ephesian for looke as eue was made of the side of adam so is euery beleeuer of the blood of christ and as euery man so farre as he is a sinfull man springeth from the first adam so doth euery man so farre as he is renewed spring from the second adam christ iesus now that a man may spring out of christ he must first being taken out of the wilde oliue the old adam rom be set and ingrafted into the second adam as a new stocke and that by faith wrought in the heart by the spirit of god by which incision hee receiueth from christ two things first in regard of his soule holines secondly in regard of bodie incorruption seeing that the whole man is vnited vnto christ and so both soule and body receiue immortalitie and glorie thirdly in this new birth there must be a new life by which if any liue not he is not borne again for the distinct knowledge of which life wee must distinguish of life life is vncreated and created vncreated life is the life of god yes god himselfe of which kind this is not created life is either naturall or spirituall naturall is that which we liue by naturall meanes as meate drinke sleepe physicke ampc of which kind this new life is not but this is that spirituall life whereby a man in this life is ruled by the spirit of god according to the word and it standeth in two thinges first when the spirit dwelleth in the heart secondly when the spirit ruleth the hart or more plainely this life hath two degrees first when a man beginneth to sauour affect and will spirituall things loueth them and chiefely affecteth them rom when they haue some sauour and rellish vnto him secondly when a man in all estates liueth by a iustifying faith and ordereth his life thereby the iust man saith abacuke liueth by faith and this is as it is truly called life eternall the beginning and first degree of which euerie beleeuer hath possession of euen in this life the second point in this ground is the weight of it for which obserue the necessitie of the new birth in the former words where it is said that without it a man shall neuer see the kingdome of god much lesse enter into it no man is in christ and so consequently out of state of saluation who is not a new creature corinthian no outward prerogatiue can bring a man in request with god vnlesse hee be a new creature gal it is a constant truth of christ ioh if i wash thee not thou hast no part in me the third point is the aduersaries who are first euery man by nature the wisedome of whom herein is enmitie with god for euery one naturally is willing to yeeld vnto god some externall seruice and ceremoniall worship as in the church to draw neere to god with their lippes but when they should come to their renewing and the mortifying of their lusts o then they storme and swell and cast off this yoke because they say it abridgeth them of their ease libertie and pleasure and they cannot bee their owne man for it secondly the romane religion which for many hundred yeres hath stood in ceremoniall and bodily actions rites gestures apparrell and most of all in outwarde penance borrowed partly of the iewes and partly of the heathen but all this doctrine of the new birth of mortifying hidden lusts and deniall of a mans selfe is dead and buried among them little hereof is spoken or written in the great volumes of their greatest clerks but y e doctrine which is from god is spirituall as god himselfe is and most concerneth the inner man secondly they are great aduersaries hereof in teaching that man though captiue to sinne hath a power in his nature whereby if the holy ghost free him he can of himselfe will and doe that which is good which if it were so then he is but in part new and so is no new man secondly a regenerate man must be a new creature now creation is a framing of something out of nothing not of something into somthing thirdly thus a man should be but halfe dead and so could not be borne againe but onely strengthened euen as a man in a swoune of whom wee cannot say properly he is reuiued because hee was not dead but recouered the ground is out of galath stand fast in the libertie wherewith christ hath made you free for the meaning of which we must know that christian libertie which wee are exhorted to maintaine standeth in a double freedome first from the morall law secondly from the ceremoniall from the morall law two waies first from the curse of the law rom there is no condemnation to them that are in christ secondly from the rigour of it which requireth personall and perfect obedience this rigour is moderated by christ whence followeth a freedome also from iustification by workes rom galath the second freedome is from the ceremoniall law which hauing an end put to it by christ bindeth no man but our libertie is procured to vs in meates drinkes and all things indifferent with good conscience seeing to the pure all things are pure tit where we are commaunded to stand fast wee see the weight of it to be such as it may not be departed from nor forsaken for then we become debters againe to the whole law and so are fallen from christ aduersaries hereof are first the libertines as the family of loue who being as they say deified are so carried by the holie ghost that they cannot sinne no though they should commit fornication but no man is freed from obedience to the law by christ although hee be from the curse and rigour of it secondly all that take libertie to sinne because they say god in christ is mercifull but christ freed from sinne not vnto it thirdly the romane church holding that the pope hath power to make lawes binding conscience properly prescribing such things to be done the obseruing of which is the worship of god and meritorious as on the popish fasting daies yes and wednesdaies and fridaies not to eate flesh euen this law bindeth the conscience of a papist and such abstinence they say is a worke of merit and a worship of god but it will be said that princes and magistrates make such lawes of meates drinkes apparell and must be obeyed ans these lawes bind not conscience but the outward man secondly they do not abrogate our libertie but moderate the ouer common vse for the common good but popish doctrine accounteth the breach of any of these mortall sin ob yes but they forbid flesh for temperance sake because it stirreth vp lust answer but they forbid not the hotest wines spice conserues amp such meates and drinkes which more stirre vp lust than flesh and therefore this is but a shift the ground is in matth whatsoeuer the church bindeth in earth is bound in heauen and whatsoeuer it looseth in earth is loosed in heauen in which ground obserue first the meaning secondly the moment thirdly the aduersaries first to know the meaning two things are to be handled first what i this power of binding and loosing which the church hath secondly what is the ratification and efficacie of this power out of those words is bound and loosed in heauen concerning the former this power of binding and loosing is that authoritie giuen by god to his church on earth whereby it pardoneth or retaineth vnpardoned the sinnes of man for mens sinnes are cords and bands which binde them prou and chaines of blacke darknes wherein man are reserued vnto damnation pet and hence fitly when mens sinnes are pardoned are they said to be loosed and bound if they be not this power is called matth the power of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen for mens sinnes are as lockes yes bars and bolts shutting vpon them the doores of heauen and hence also when the church pardoneth sinnes the doores of heauen are said to be opened and when it retaineth them heauen is shut against the sinner indeede pardon of sinne is properly granted and giuen by god but yet man are truly said to pardon and retaine sinne when ministerially they pronounce that god pardoneth or doth not pardon ob it will be said that man vpon earth know not whose sins god will pardon and whose he will not ans it is possible for man to know whose sinnes god wil pardon and whose hee will not for god hath generally made knowne that he will remit the sinnes of all beleeuers and repentant sinners but will retaine their sinnes who goe on in the same now we may know particularly who these bee that doe repent and beleeue for the tree is knowne by the fruite according vnto which the church may pronounce a true sentence further to know more distinctly what this power is the parts of it are to bee considered and they bee two for it standeth partly in the ministerie of the word and partly in the iurisdiction of the church vpon earth the ministery of the word is either publike or priuate first the publike ministerie of the word is called the preaching of it in which is this binding and loosing opening and shutting it being an ordinance of god in which ministers are called of god to pronounce in the name of god pardon of sinne to the penitent and condemnation to the obstinate and here must bee noted that this binding and loosing in the publike ministerie is generall vnto all but with exception of faith and repentance ob but seeing it is generall it is of no great force ans it is for euery hearer must applie this general doctrine to his owne person and say with the virgin mary applying to her self the angels speech be it vnto me according to thy word this maketh it forcible in the conscience the priuate ministerie standeth in two things first priuate admonition secondly priuate comfort priuate admonition is god ordinance whereby the minister in god name bindeth a man to iudgement for his sinne except hee repent thus peter dealt with simon magus act priuate comfort is when vpon true repentance the minister pronounceth vpon the beleeuer pardon of sinne without condition thus dealt nathan with dauid sam dauid said i haue sinned nathan hereupon telleth him his sinnes are forgiuen secondly concerning the iurisdiction of the church it is a power giuen of god to the church whereby it vseth correction vpon open sinners for their saluation and it standeth in excommunication and absolution excommunication is a sentence excluding open and obstinate sinners out of the kingdome of god and consequently from the societie of the church for this followeth the former if he will not heare the church let him be an heathen paul calleth this sentence a giuing vp of a man vnto satan ob but no man can exclude another from the kingdome of god ans the church excludeth not properly but by declaring that god hath excluded such ob but the true childe of god may bee excommunicated and yet is not shut out of heauen ans in some sort and for a time he may be said to be shut out of heauen but conditionally and vntill repentance the contrarie hereof is publike absolution when open sinners repenting are by the church openly declared to be members of the kingdome of heauen and so admitted and receiued againe into the church this power of the church differeth from the power of the ciuill magistrate in foure things first the power of the church is ordered onely by the word but ciuill power by other ciuill lawes also secondly the former correcteth only by voice in admonition suspension and excommunication the latter by reall and bodily punishments thirdly all spirituall correction as excommunication it selfe standeth at the repentance of a sinner and proceedeth no further but the punishments of ciuill power stay not at repentance but proceede on euen to the death of the malefactor notwithstanding his repentance if he be a man of death fourthly in the ciuill power bee three degrees of proceeding first the knowledge of the cause secondly the giuing of the sentence thirdly the execution of the punishment in ecclesiasticall are the two former but the last belongeth to god alone the second thing in the meaning is to know what the ratification of this power is namely to be bound and loosed in heauen that is when the churches iudgment following the iudgement of god doth acquite or condemne a sinner god in heauen hath done it alreadie and ratifieth it for in absolution as also in the other pardon of sinne is first giuen in heauen secondly the church pronounceth this according to god will amp thirdly god ratifieth it thereupon in heauen and confirmeth it as sure as if on earth he had pronounced the pardon the second point the weight of this ground may appeare mat where the maine promise of the gospell for the stablishment of the church is contained vpon this rocke i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it and the ground of our assurance thereof is added verse i will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome this maketh the church preuaile against the gates of hell because it openeth amp sh teth heauen secondly hereby the word and sacraments are preserued from pollution and prophanation the soules of man pulled out of the snares of the diuell and god kingdome set open vnto them which being taken away there will be no difference left betweene the kingdome of god and the kingdome of the diuell which power of the keyes in opening and shutting heauen by the ministerie of the word seeing wee haue established by the lawes of the land we haue the state of a true church and therefore no man can in good conscience separate from vs as no church and people of god indeed if it had not the power to open heauen vnto man it were time to separate from it the aduersaries of this ground are first the ignorant people who popishly thinke that this power is onely giuen to peter whose office now is to open and shut heauen but this power was giuen to all the apostles as well as peter and in them to al ministers churches and congregations yes and it is not exercised in heauen but in earth secondly all atheists and epicures that contemne and skorne the word sacraments and all holy things yes euen the power of the church it selfe thirdly all papists and the roman religion who abolish all binding and loosing in the publike ministerie and haue brought al to a priuate shrift and absolution which in truth is nothing else but a racke and a gibbet to the conscience for first man must seeke for it at the hands of the priest secondly they must confesse all their sinnes to the priest thirdly they must make satisfaction to the iustice of god euen such as the priest shall enioyne them but all this is directly contrary to y e word for first ministers must offer pardon of sin before it bee sought for secondly in christ pardon is offered freely wee neede no satisfaction of our owne thirdly they impose a heauier yoke than euer christ or his apostles did vpon man when they enioyne them to an enumeration of all their sinnes before they can be pardoned the depth of which policie hath been sounded secondly that religion hath turned this power ecclesiasticall to a ciuill power whereby they take vpon them to excommunicate kings amp emperours not only out of the church also out of their kingdomes and empires whom they say they may set vp and depose at their pleasure as hauing power to wrest the scepter out of the hands of whatsoeuer monarch shall not stoope vnder their popes authoritie these bee the maine enemy of this ground against whom we must for euer contend the ground of faith is there is hath been and euer shall be a church one of which is no saluation this is an article of our faith and a maine ground of religion for if there be not euer a church of god christ is sometime no redeemer no king because there should be no people redeemed nor subiects to the rule of his word and spirit of which consider two things first what this church is secondly who be the aduersaries of this ground for the first the church is a company of man chosen to saluation called vnited to christ and admitted into euerlasting fellowship with him see hebr and pet compare these two places and this discription wil easily bee gathered the properties of this church are these sixe which follow first being the spouse of christ she is one onely indeed although distinguished in regard of time as the church of the old testament and of the new secondly of place as of england scotland ampc thirdly of condition as the militant and triumphant all these make but one bodie of christ secondly it is inuisible not to bee seene but beleeued for election vocation redemption can onely be beleeued yet some parts of it are visible as in the right vse of the word and sacraments appeareth thirdly to this assemblie and no other belong all the promises of this life and the life to come especially forgiuenes of sins and life euerlasting fourthly it consisteth onely of liuing members quickened by the spirit of christ not of any hypocrites or wicked persons fiftly no member of it can be seuered or cut off fro christ but abide in him and with him for euer sixtly it is the ground amp pillar of truth that is the doctrine of true religion is alwaies safely kept and maintained in it obiect the churches in earth are true churches and yet in these are many hypocrites and apostata s who fall from their profession and therefore all are not liuing members answer in visible churches are two sortes of man lust man and hypocrites who although they bee within the church yet the church is not so called of them but in regard of them onely who are truly ioyned vnto christ who are the better part although not the greater euen as a heape of wheate and chaffe together is called an heape of wheate or a corne heape of the better part aduersaries hereof are papists who frame not the church by these true properties but by other deceitfull markes as succession multitude antiquitie and consent for when y e church first began there could be none of those at least not the three former and yet was there a true church secondly all these agree to heretikes as among the iewes what was more challenged than these and yet christ saith they were blind leaders of the blinde but the true marke is the doctrine of the prophets and apostles truly taught and beleeued a note of christs sheep is the hearing of his voice ioh and ye are in the father and the son if ye abide in the word which yee haue heard from the beginning ioh see ephesian the ground is that there shall be a resurrection of the dead in the end of the world this was one of the sixe grounds of catechisme in the daies of the apostles heb hymeneus and philetus destroyed the faith of certaine in teaching that the resurrection was past alreadie aduersaries hereof are the familie of loue who hold that there is no resurrection but only in this life the last ground of doctrine is there shall be a generall iudgement of all flesh it is one of the grounds heb in which iudgement euery mans workes shall be tried and euery man accordingly shall receiue sentence of life or death eternall the aduersaries hereof are first the atheist who denieth god himselfe and consequently his iudgement secondly the drowsie protestant who in iudgement denie not the last iudgement but yet plainly shew in their liues that they are not perswaded of it for then would they make more conscience of sin and of pleasing god in all thi these are the maine grounds of beleefe vnto which all other may be reduced now follow the grounds of obedience and practise the first ground of practise is luke except ye repent ye shall perish in which two things are to bee obserued first the dutie required that is repentance the necessitie of which appeareth in that without it man perish secondly the aduersaries concerning repentance two things must be taught first what it is secondly what is the vse of it for the first repentance as paul describeth it is a conuersion whereby a sinner turneth himselfe vnto god and bringeth foorth fruites worthie amendement of life there be two kindes of conuersion of a sinner first that whereby god turneth man secondly that whereby a man being turned by god turneth himselfe by grace the former is not repentance properly but the latter iere conuert thou me and i shall bee conuerted surely after that i conuerted i repented quest in what part is this conuersion made ans it beginneth in the minde but it is of the whole man the minde laying off all purpose of sinning the conscience calling backe from sinne the will not seeking to fulfill the lusts of it but the whole man endeuouring to please god thorough his whole conuersation further repentance is attended with diverse fruites worthie newnes of life these are the duties of the morall law performed in faith and truth without hypocrisie which because they proceede from the same beginning are approoued of god as repentance is the second point in this dutie is the vse of repentance and that is not to be cause of saluation but only a way wherin man must walke to life euerlasting we are slandered by the popish church while they exclaime that our doctrine requireth nothing but faith to be saued by and so wee become enemy to all good workes but this is not our doctrine for we hold the workes of repentance to be the way of saluation indeed when we speak of the instrument wherby we lay hold vpon christ that we say is faith onely not hope loue or any workes but when wee speake of a way to life then faith is not alone but repentance is required hope the feare of god and e y good worke so woman are said to be saued thorough bearing of children tim namely as a way wherein they practise their faith and obedience thus abrahams faith and workes went together iam secondly the aduersaries of this ground are first professors of religion who content themselues with a fained repentance for most man being pricked and stung with the sense of their sinnes for a while will hold downe their heads like a bulrush breake off their company come to church pray heare the word and performe other duties but when the remorse is once past they returne to their former course of licentiousnes and this is thought a sufficient repentance whereas it is but ceremoniall and a fig leafe whereby man seeke to couer themselues for true repentance changeth the minde will affections conscience yes all the actions of life secondly the roman church which for many hundred yeeres hath ouerturned this doctrine as first in generall aboue these yeeres penance and publike confession of persons excommunicated hath bin by them taken and deemed to be repentance it selfe any other hath been scarse taught or knowne in these partes of the world secondlie repentance is by them turned into a iudiciall proceeding and sentence of the court wherein y e minister must be iudge the sinner must come vnder confession the minister must passe sentence and the other must make satisfaction accordingly which is an high abuse of this doctrine thirdly they hold the workes of contrition confession and satisfaction to merit yes and to conferre pardon of sinne and so abolish the merit and satisfaction of christ secondly the world hath bin by that church deceiued in diverse particulars concerning this doctrine as namely first it hath bin taught that repentance for the originall of it is partly from nature partly from grace partly from god partly from our selues which is a false foundation ioyning light with darkenesse it being wholy from grace secondly remorse of conscience which the very diuels may haue is made a parte of repentance saul himselfe nay iudas wanted not this contrition which is no grace but a preparation vnto it thirdly they make auricular confession whereby euery man is bound to confesse all and euery one of his sins with their circumstances in the priests eare so necessarilie vnto repentance as without which he cannot haue pardon which is a very gibbet to the conscience fourthly they turne their canonicall satisfaction into satisfaction of god i stice for sinne wherein blasphemously they ouerthrow the most perfect satisfaction of the son of god we are therfore to praise god who hath taken from our neckes this yoke of the roman church which neither wee not our fathers were able to beare the second ground of practise is concerning the exercise of repentance luke if any man wil come after me let him deny himselfe and take vp his crosse and follow me in which ground we will consider three thinges first the meaning secondly the moment thirdly the aduersaries against whom wee must contend for the meaning if any man wil follow me that is will bee my disciple for disciples vsed to follow their maisters and teachers hee must learne three duties first le him denie himselfe secondlie take vp his crosse thirdlie follow mee to the deniall of our selues three things are required first we must for the magnifying of the grace of god ab se our selues euen to nothing an example whereof wee haue in paul corinthian i i haue planted apollo hath watred but neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watreth but god that giueth increase if the planter bee nothing much lesse the planted we are not able as of our selues to think a good thought and againe all our sufficiencie is of god secondly wee must renounce our owne reason and will and bring them vnder subiection to the will of god wee must not striue to haue willes of our owne but let christs will be sufficient for vs his wisedome must be our reason thirdly wee must esteeme all things as dung for christ and preserue within vs a readines to leaue and forsake friends riches honours yes ou libertie and life it selfe if need be for his sake and a good conscience the second dutie is to take vp our crosse daily vnto which two things are required first euery member of the church must make reckoning of and looke for daily crosses priuate and particular in his calling and in his profession secondly when the crosse commeth it must be taken vp cheerfully and borne with reioycing matth reioyce and be glad namely euen when man reuile and persecute you rom iustified persons are able to reioyce in tribulations according to the exhortation iam count it a exceeding ioy an example of the saints hebr who suffred with ioy the spoyling of their goods the third dutie of a disciple is after the two former to follow christ for when christ saith and follow me it is as though he had said i goe before bearing my crosse let my disciples follow me step by step in bearing of this crosse this containeth in it the maine duties of christian religion to the performing of which two things are to be done first wee must beare the crosse in obedience as christ did who most willingly abased himselfe to the death euen the death of the crosse in obedience to his fathers will qu but wherein stood this obedience of christ ans in the practise of three speciall vertues first meekenes he opened not his mouth hee reuiled not being reuiled reuenged not when hee might secondly patience he grudged not to suffer those bitter torments for his very enemy thirdly loue he prayed for those that pierced him and shed his heart blood in all which it is our part to imitate him secondly wee must be conformable vnto christ being our head which conformitie consisteth in crucifying our body of corruption euen as he was crucified vpon his crosse we must arme our selues with peters exhortation pet to suffer in the flesh as christ suffered in the flesh which whosoeuer doth he ceaseth from sinne he liueth not henceforth after the lusts of man but after the will of god verse the learning of this dutie helpeth forward our obedience vnder the crosse which many cannot attaine vnto who in the time of their peace are in some sort obedient because they beare not about in their body the dyings of christ daily corinthian the second point the moment and weight of this ground appeareth luke he that will saue his life shall lose it that is that will not take vp his crosse to follow christ shall neuer be saued againe baptisme is a maine ground heb namely as it is ioyned with inward baptisme for els outward baptisme may be wanting so it be without contempt but both together are a maine ground especially in regard of that stipulation we make and that profession which wee receiue vpon vs thereby of forsaking euen our selues and following of christ without which can bee no saluation which being the matter and substance of this ground sheweth euidently the importance of it the third point aduersaries of this ground are first among our selues such as are content to make christ a sauiour and redeemer but not a patterne and example of imitation in his vertues but christ will not be made a packhorse only to beare sinnes seeing hee hath propounded himselfe a president to be followed of those who looke for saluation by his sufferings they must first bee his disciples before he be their redeemer secondly a more wicked enemie withstanding this doctrine is the church of rome in exalting nature and extenuating the grace of god as first holding that all sinnes deserue not not death but may bee done away with a little knocking on the breast or such light sorrow secondly that by nature a man hath free will in his conuersion and being helped by the holy ghost can moue himselfe vnto saluation thirdly that after iustification there is nothing in a man that god can hate fourthly that a man may merit life and performe workes of satisfaction to god which diuellish doctrines what else doe they but make the heart swell with pride so as it can neuer be brought to the deniall of it selfe the third ground is taken from the morall law thou s alt haue no other god before my face the scope and meaning of which law is to direct vs in chusing the true god onely to bee our god which is done first when we know and acknowledge him as hee hath reuealed himselfe in his word secondly when wee giue our hearts vnto him according to that precept my son giue me thy heart now the heart is giuen to god when he is loued and feared aboue all when he is alone trusted in relied on in danger when we ascribe all power vnto him beleeue in him subiect our selues vnto him in our very conscience for whatsoeuer hath these is become our god secondly that this is a ground cannot bee doubted for whosoeuer taketh not the true god for his god is out of all way to saluation seeing there is no couenant betweene god and him and being out of the couenant can haue no part not inheritance in god kingdome thirdly aduersaries of this ground are first the roman doctrine which committeth high treason against god in giuing his honour to other things as to saints and dead man whom they make god by teaching inuocation to bee due vnto them and so attributing an infinite power wisedome or presence vnto them which are god proprieties secondly in teaching that man can merit they make them god for if christ himselfe had bin a meere man he could not haue merited thirdly in ascribing to dead creatures the vertue of the holie ghost as to water the power of sanctification driuing away diuels and washing a ay sinnes fourthly in setting vp the woodden crosse for a god which must be worshipped with the same worship and affection as god himselfe is the virgin mary they make a goddesse and queen of heauen whom they pray to commaund her son and lastly the pope to whom they giue power to pardon sinne properly and to make lawes to binde conscience as properly as god lawes doe the second aduersarie is the comm protestant who carrieth an outward profession of christ but in his heart setteth vp many god as the belly wealth pleasure yes the diuell is the god of many man as philipp corinthian others set all their hearts and studie for the accomplishment of their sinnes now sin hauing the hold in their hearts is become their god yes and it is a common practise of many protestant i their crosses to put off their confidence in god and betake themselues to cunning man and southsayers so leauing the liuing god and trust for thei helpe in the diuell himselfe the fourth ground of practise concerneth the worship of god exod thou shalt not make to thy selfe any image ampc the first point the meaning this commandement hath two parts the former forbidding the making of images the latter the worshipping of them the former in these words thou shalt not make vnto thy selfe ampc in which is not simply forbidden the making of images as if they bee for politicall or historicall vse ut the making of them in way of religion or conscience to put vs in remembrance of god or to worship god in by or at the same the latter in these words thou shalt not bow downe ampc that is thou shalt not so much as bow downe thy bodie before such an image made by others neither to worship it no the true god in it which exposition because it is oppugned by a great part of the world i will prooue by some reasons first that which was the sinne of the israelites in making images is here forbidden but their common sinne in the vse of images was to make them representations of the true god and to worship the true god in them as appeareth exod the israelites hauing made a golden calfe said these be thy god o israel which brought thee out of the land of egypt that is this is a representatio of that god who brought thee out of egypt for they should haue been worse then mad man if they had called that calfe which was but one day old that god which brought them many daies before out of egypt besides that images true or false are vsually called by the name of god as being so in the reputation of the worshippers f rther aaron said to morrow shall be the holy day of the lord signifying that the calfe was made to represent the true god whom in the calfe they were to worship againe iudg michae mother sheweth that her intent was to worship god in the image when shee saith that shee had dedicated eleuen hundred shekels of siluer to the lord to make a grauen and molten image and hauing made the image she saith now will the lord blesse me though his fact was grosse idolatry yet he sheweth that he worshipped the lord in the image whose blessing he boasted of esai to whom will y ken god whence it is plaine they made images of the true god to worship him in iudg the israelites were sore afflicted for seruing baal and that is idols fetched from the heathen but herein their intent was to worship the true god in them as appeareth hose thou shalt call me no more yes the very heathen themselues worshipped the true god in their images rom they turned the glorie of the true god into the similitude of a corruptible creature much more then the israelites who took their idolatry from them and therefore in the second commandement is forbidden the making of images of the true god and not of false onely as the papists would falsely teach vs the second reason is in deut where moses making a commentarie vpo this coman ement and forbidding to make any representation of any figure addeth this reason ye saw no image in the day that the lord spake out of horeb and therefore moses vnderstood the commandement as we doe namely not to make any image of the true god the third reason is in the words thou shalt not make the image of any thing that is in heauen aboue ampc seeing then that god is in heauen aboue as also the saints and angels wee must make no image to represent them for euen images of the true god are idols hated of god and condemned in the scriptures so the golden calfe is called an idoll act the second point is the weight of this ground standing herein that whosoeuer ouerthroweth this ground ouerturneth this religion for first whosoeuer resembleth god in any image and worshippeth him therein he denieth the true god rom the wisest of the heathe worshipping god in their images turned the truth of god into a lie so whatsoeuer me may beleeue of worshipping y e true god in an image the truth is it will proue no better than a lie vnto them the apostle affirmeth that whatsoeuer the gentiles sacrificed to idols they sacrificed it vnto diuels and not vnto god some may aske how can this be seeing their intent was to sacrifice vnto god i answere that by offer to an image they denied god and so not seruing him they became sacrificers to the diuels for whosoeuer conceiueth of god otherwise than he will be conceiued of conceiue an idoll and not god and he that wil remember him in things wherein he will not be remembred forgetteth him as the israelites psalm secondly professed idolatry maketh a separation betweene god and his people as adulterie doth betweene man and wife for as a wife that seeketh to strangers denieth her proper husband so the church which is the spouse of god going a whoring after images and strange god denieth god her husband and procureth the bill of diuorce see hose and ierem thirdly the aduersaries of this ground are the professed papists first in allowing making of images for religions sake as the image of christ crucified which they call the crucifixe and of christ glorified which they call agnus dei also images of the virgin mary and other saints yes cursing and condemning all those that forbid the making of them amp so curse euen the lord himselfe yes and most blasphemouslie in former times they were wont to make images of the trinitie picturing the father like an old man the son like a childe the holie ghost like a doue and yet much more blasphemously than that otherwise but they are now ashamed of such wicked pictures secondly they maintaine yes and commaund the worship of christ in an image and condemne them who deny the worshipping of images whether they be images of god or of saints angels and dead man thirdly they teach that a man is to worship the crucifixe religiously yes with the same worship and deuotion with which christ is worshipped wherewith also they worship their breaden god in former times their consciences secretly checking them of their idolatries caused them to leaue out the whole second commandement and diuide the last into two to fill vp the number but of later daies seeing they are constrained to retaine the commaundement they haue found out some shift which we will examine first they say there is a difference be weene an idoll and an image as the one is a greeke word the other a latin the former is a representation of the true god the latter of false god ans the difference is but in the word for indeed they be both one acts the calfe was an image and an idoll too ob they make difference also of worship which they say is of two sorts the first is latreia this is a worship and reuerence due to god onely the second is dulia and this is a seruice due vnto saints to y e crucifixe ampc ans but besides that y e scripture make these both one they herein bewray their follie in that if either be greater it is dulia which is a kind of seruice most submisse and that properly which vassals were wont to yeeld their lord who had taken them in war and yet this must be giuen to saints and the wooden crosse being the greatest subiection ob but they intend to worship not the image of the crosse but christ in it ans no intention of man can institute a true worship of god without warrant from god himselfe who neuer authorized man to worship him in images ob englishman kneele downe to the chaire of estate the king not being in presence and therefore wee may much more to saints and angels ans first this is a ciuill and politic worship testifying the subiects alleageance but kneeling to saints is religious secondly the king appointeth his chaire of estate to be a signe of his presence and willeth it but no papist can proue that euer christ appointed a crucifixe to bee a signe of his presence or that god willeth their images to bee signes of his presence thirdly the chaire of estate is a signe only in the kings absence for himselfe being present the ciuill worship is performed to himselfe but christ is neuer absent from his church and yet in his presence they set vp an image to remember him by thus that church being an open idolater must not bee ioyned with for she is not ioyned to christ any longer but is a professed harlot neither i it so indifferet as some think to finde saluation there as well as by our religion the fifth ground is matth thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serue that this is a chiefe ground needes no proofe and therefore wee will consider first the meaning secondly the aduersaries against whom wee must contend to know the meaning the words going before will affoord vs some direction wherein satan hauing moued christ to fall downe and worship him with bodily worship only and requiring not the maine worship due to god but a little bowing of the bodie betokening that he was the disposer of the kingdomes of the world this christ denieth him with this reason ratified by scripture that it is a worship and seruice proper to god and to bee tendred to him onely secondly the words themselues are to bee weighed by worship is properly signified bodily worship in a bodily gesture the meaning then is thou shalt with thy bodie adore the lord for so it is sutable to satans demaund the word serue signifieth all worship due to god both inward and outward only this word appertaineth to both the members and so to the whole sentence for else there should bee no direct deniall of satans temptation requiring onely the former and not the latter but some will say we may serue man lawfully how then is seruice proper to god only there be two kindes of worship religious and ciuill religious is an action or actions of reuerence and subiection whereby a man doth acknowledge the godhead it self or the properties thereof either in god himselfe truly or in the creature falsely these properties of god are first to bee an absolute lord secondly to bee almightie thirdly to be present in al places at all times fourthly to heare all man in all places at all times fiftly to know all things past present and to come yes and the hearts of man sixtly to be giuer of all good things and the preuenter of all euill now any action of reuerence in signification of any of these properties is a religious worship the very intent of the minde in religious worship being to ascribe either godhead or diuine properties to the thing worshipped ciuill or politic worship is when man performe actions of reuerence and subiection to others as acknowledging them to bee preferred aboue themselues in gifts or authoritie thus bowing of the bodie is sometime religious when it is done to god in acknowledging his properties and sometime ciuil performed to a man in respect of his eminency in gifts or gouernment but these words of christ are meant only of the former and not of the latter which belongs vnto man this ground thus truly conceiued affoordeth vs these two maine points of religion first that god is to be worshipped with religious worship secondly that all religious worship is proper to god and due to him alone now religious worship is two fold first inward standing in two things faith and inward obedience secondly outward when this inward worship is outwardly testified consisting of three principall parts first in preaching hearing and reading the word secondly in receiuing the two sacraments thirdly in prayer and thanksgiuing publike and priuate the aduersaries hereof are the papists who pretend the catholike religion but indeed ouerthrow it in deprauing the outward worshippe of god wherein the inward is testified the first part whereof standing in the preaching hearing and reading of the word they depraue first by mingling the pure word of god with mans word and writings and authorising bookes apocryphall as canonicall scripture secondly by making vnwritten traditions apostolicall and ecclesiasticall as they say of equall authoritie with the scripture thirdly in that they teach in their catechismes that the worship of god doth stand in obeying the commandements of the church as wel as the commandements of god themselues and are necessarily to be practised vnto saluation amp so they worship god in vain mat fourthly in that they allow no bible to be uthenticall but onely the latin translation of iere ie renouncing both the hebrew and greeke fountaines and ye learned papists confesse that their latin text i corrupted and that therefore the true sense is to bee fetched from the popes determination and from councels and no other sense to be admitted fiftly in that they make images lay mens bookes and teachers and debarre the people of the scriptures publikely and priuately in the vulgar tongue and suffer it only to be read by them and vnto them in the latin tongue vnknowne vnto them the second part of outward worship standing in administration of sacraments they likewise corrupt and abolish for howsoeuer baptisme is preserued for the substance of it in the roman church which as a lanterne carrieth the light it retaineth not for it owne but for the hidden churches sake within it yet haue they abolished the lord supper for the substance of it first of a sacrament they haue made it reall sacrifice secondly they haue turned the communion into a priuate masse where the priest alone receiueth all and the people nothing thirdly although in a sacrament the e must bee a distinction between the signe and the thing signified yet they make none but ouerthrow all such signification of the signes by their transubstantiation fourthly they haue turned the bodie of christ into a breaden god which they carrie about in boxes and worship which is as vilde an idolatry as euer was among the heathen not inferiour to the worshipping of cats and buls as god among the egyptians fiftly they haue added to christs institution fiue sacraments viz penance confirmation orders matrimonie and annoynting but indeede baptisme is a sacrament of penance the lord supper of confirmation and further are they deceiued in the other the third part of outward worship concerneth prayer and thankesgiuing this they ouerthrow likewise first they mocke god in praying in an vnknowne tongue not knowing what they aske much lesse seriously addressing themselues vnto the dutie which euen earthly kings would disdaine secondly in prayer must bee brought sense of want and contrition of heart this they cannot bring who are taught that they merit by prayer thirdly prayer must be made in particular faith but this they make presumption fourthly they allow praying to creatures amp the mediation of saints and so denie the very substance of prayer which is to make request to god only in the alone mediation of christ the second maine poin of religion out of this ground is this that religious worship is due to god alone for wee may not giue apparance of religious worship to creatures cornelius is reprooued for giuing to peter excesse euen of ciuill worship acts for he knew peter to bee a man and not god and so seemed to mingle a kinde of religious worship with ciuill this is a maine ground also which whosoeuer denieth he holdeth no the head christ column the aduersaries of this ground also are the professed papists who worship saint and angels not onely by kneeling before them but praying also vnto them which cannot be denied to bee a religious worship seeing it attributeth vnto them to heare the prayers of all man all times in all places ye and to know the hearts of man vpon earth secondly they maintaine religious worship of images they goe on pilgrimage vnto them offer incense creepe vnto them and kneele before them yes they worship the crucifixe with the same worshippe whereby they would adore christ if hee were liuing vpon earth as also the reliques of saints out of all which wee see what to thinke of that church which onely hath the name of a church she holdeth not the head christ seeing for so many hundred yeeres she hath displaied her fornication in worshipping saints angels images and the virgin mary so as her bill of diuorcement is iustly giuen her thess revelation from whom we must separate if we would not partake with her in her plagues the sixth ground of practise is esai sanctifie the lord of hostes which words contain the substance of the third commaundement in which consider first the meaning secondly the weight thirdly the aduersaries for the meaning a thing is said to bee sanctified two waies either when it is made holy or when it is acknowledged to bee holie now this latter must bee heere vnderstood for god name cannot be made holie which is holinesse it selfe and the first cause of all holinesse but it is sanctified of vs when wee acknowledge it holie and this our sanctification of god either respecteth god himselfe or the gifts of god our sanctification of god himselfe the thing intended in this ground is done two waies first when in our mind we acknowledge and praise him in his attributes of wisedome mercie louing kindnes power prouidence and such like pet sanctifie the lord god in your hearts that is acknowledge him in his wisedome power and other his attributes look as good subiects speaking of and mentioning their prince will put off their hats in reuerent opinion of him so we religiously should thinke and speake of these iob fearing only and but suspecting that his sonnes in their feastings had dishonoured this name of god sanctified them when hez k h heard y e blasphemies of rabshak h against god be humbled himself rent his cloathes and put on sackcloath king yes wicked ahab hauing heard though falsely that nab had blasphemed god he rent his cloathes and proclaimed a fast which sheweth whatsoeuer his fact was the vse and manner of holy man in his time when god name was dishonoured and blasphemed secondly wee sanctifie god himselfe when wee with reuerence acknowledge his titles as god lord iehoua father christ iesus holy ghost and not without religious and obedient affection speaking or thinking of them our sanctification of god gifts which are many as the word preached prayer sacraments meate drinke and all things seruing for the good of bodie or soule is not by giuing or adding any holines vnto them which in themselues are all holie but when we acknowledge them holie by preparing our selues to a holie vse of them and vse them accordingly with good conscience for euery creature of god hath a double vse first a lawful vse when god permits a general vse of his creatures thus all may vse meate drinke apparell ampc secondly a holy vse when a creature in his lawful vse is vsed in a holy manner for this includeth the former though that may be without this for example all the iewes kept the passeouer lawfully but onely those celebrated it holily who prepared themselues according to the commandement which holy vse is obtained by the word and prayer tim the word directeth vs to vse these gifts of god in obedience and prayer obtaineth grace to vse them according to the worde vnto which holy vse of god creatures we are to be mooued by these reasons first we must distinguish our selues from the bruite beast the swine in the forrest teth vp the maste but looketh not vp to heauen no not to the tree whence it falleth secondly because we haue lost our title to all the creatures in adam which onely is in this vse restored thirdly because they are the gifts of god we must thus acknowledge them to be his and in him learne to vse them fourthly that vice may auoide the common abuse of them whereby hee is prouoked to displeasure the second point is the weight of this ground which may appeare in the con rie seeing the blasphemer doth what hee can to ouerthrow the godhead it selfe whence euery such one is called by such a name as signifieth a of god or one that thrusteth god thorough and therefore the sanctification of god is a ground of moment secondly the first petition of the lord prayer is sanctified be thy name wherein wee are taught to preferre and pray for the hallowing of god name before our own saluation thirdly the scope of the third commandemet is the same which whosoeuer obserueth not reuerseth both the former and lastly the lord is so iealous of his glorie that he will bee sanctified of all them that come neere him else hee will sanctifie himselfe in their confusion leuit thirdly the aduersaries of this ground are first though by god mercie the religion of the church of england is no aduersary vnto it yet the liues of the most fight against it for although when we mention earthly princes wee can vse all reuerence yet god name is most fearfully abused and tossed in wicked mens mouthes by oathes and cursed speakings besides that many abuse the same to charmes and spels in their sorceries and man thinke all is well because herein they vse good words but the truth is the better the words be the greater is the sinne yes it is noted to be a signe of a low and base spirit not to sweare and blaspheme vpon any occasion many souldiers thinke they cannot be couragious enough vnlesse they pierce god amp rent christ by detestable oathes such as would cause wicked ahab himselfe to rend his cloathes at the hearing secondly the great aduersarie is the papist and that diverse waies first in that they teach that the very doing of some worke is a sanctification of god as the outward worke of baptisme yes in it the very action of the minister is a worship of god and doth confer grace ex opere operat this was their old doctrine which now they colour with this addition if the partie be well and rightly disposed but besides the vse yes the lawful and common vse there is by this ground required an holy vse of any thing to make it acceptable to god or rightly profitable to the doer himselfe secondly their hallowing of water bels palmes ashes spettle is a meere mockerie of god seeing they haue neither word nor promise from god that these creatures should thus be hallowed to preserue from euill bodie or soule thirdly they erre in the foundation of religion diuer waies euery which such error is blasphemie fourthly that religion oppugneth the sanctification of god name in the vse of a lawful oath teaching first that the pope hath power to dispense with an oath secondly that man may sweare by the masse and so doing make it a god thirdly euen the learned among them with one consent hold that a man may sweare ambiguously euen when he knoweth the thing to be otherwise the seuenth ground is galath the whole law is fulfilled in this one word thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe the meaning is not that we should loue our neighbour equally with our selues and with no lesse affection or degree of loue but that with the same cheerefulnes willingnes and truth of heart that we perform duties of loue to our selues ought wee also to reach them out vnto others the weight of this ground appeareth in that not onely christ saith it is like the great commandement but also in that it is the summe of the whole law for the first table must be practised in the second and the loue of god testified in loue to man the aduersaries of this ground bee the popish church who thus expound it first loue thy self and then thy neighbour making the loue of our selues the foundation of the loue of others but sometime wee may loue our neighbour aboue our selues as ionathan loued dauid more than his own soule and christ loued his enemy more than his owne life secondly it teacheth that a man must not loue particularly his particular enemie nor salute him in particular but generally as if hee salute a whole company together his enemie being there the eighth ground exod honour thy father and thy mother ampc in the words two things are to be considered first an ordinance of god secondly the meanes to preserue it the ordinance is that all man must not be equall in degree but there must bee orders of man of whom some are to be in higher degree as superiours some in lower condition as inferiours the former are aboue others in regarde of power to command and to punish the latter are in subiection vnder others by whose discretion and will they are to be gouerned this ordinance is described rom let euery soule be subiect to the superiour power that is be content to be vnder others which are above him in power so here some must bee as fathers and mothers some must bee subiected vnto them the meanes to preserue this ordinance is the yeelding of honour vnto whom it belongeth which standeth in three things first in reuerence towards the persons of superiours secondly in obedience to their iust commandements thirdly in thankefulnes for their paines in gouerning thus is that golden sentence to be expounded matth giue vnto c sar the things that are caesars that is giue him reuerence obedience thankfulnes according to that rom giue feare vnto whom feare belongeth honour to whom honour tribute to whom tribute the weight of this ground is plaine because without it can be no practise of true religion for first by it stand the three things the familie the church and common wealth all which are maintained by gouernment and subiection wherefore the lord set this commandement the first of the second table as whereupon he would found all humane societies secondly gouernour in any of these societies are the keepers of both tables without whose helpe and authoritie god kingdome could haue no abiding on the earth aduersaries of this commandement are the papists who weaken the authoritie of the magistrate in exempting their clergie from all ciuill power of magistracie in causes both iudiciall that is matters controuersall and criminall that is matters of trespasse although the apostle saith let euery soule be subiect secondly that church hath set vp a power to bring into order and subiection all the kings vpon earth namely the power of the pope who challengeth to himselfe to ouerrule yes and to depose at his pleasure kings and queenes who in their dominions are aboue al and only vnder god thirdly that religion lesseneth the power of parents for in the councel of trent they establish first mariages and contracts made by children without consent of parents secondly vowes also made by children vnder age and without consent of parents are held lawful and not to be broken the ninth ground is micha he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what the lord requireth of thee surely to do iustly to loue mercie to humble thy selfe and to walke with thy god the meaning three vertues are here required first iust d aling secondly mercie thirdly humilitie touching the first wee are commanded to do iustly and this execution of iustice between man and man hath fiue substantiall parts first to giue honor to whom honor is due secondly by thought word and deed to preserue the body and soule of our neighbour that is his life spirituall and temporall thirdly his chastitie which is the honor of bodie and soule in single life and matrimonie fourthly his worldly estate fiftly his good name this is the scope of all the commandements of the second table now because the due execution of iustice must bee tempered with mercie therefore is mercie required of man in the second place which is a readinesse to relieue the miserie of the distressed and thirdly because iustice and mercie without godlinesse are but ciuil vertues we are in the last place commaunded to walke in humilitie with our god which containeth the summe of the first table and standeth in three things first wee must acknowledge our sinnes secondly intreate for pardon thirdly purpose not to offend god any more but endeuour to preuent sinne to come concerning y weight of this ground it appeareth in micha where the lord testifieth himselfe to be more delighted with the practise of loue and mercie than with oblations of thousands of rammes and tenne thousand river of oyle and elsewhere i will haue mercie and not sacrifice yes titus this is made the end of the appearing of the grace of god that we should liue soberly in regard of our selues iustly in regard of others and godly in regard of god these vertues are so respected of god that they are said to go immediatly before his face psalm and so necessarie among man that without them no societie can be preserued the aduersaries hereof are first the liues of most man who seeke their own things and not to maintaine the liues goods name chastitie of others yes too many preferre their priuate gaine before the common good of man in church and common wealth secondly the maine aduersarie is the romane religion which defendeth the greatest iniustice that can be by establishing a monarchy among themselues not onely controlling the soueraigne authoritie of princes in their owne kingdomes but also exempting their subiects from their alleageance at their pleasure of which vsurped power deba e them once and that counterfeit religion will fall with it because it is onely vnderpropped by it secondly that religion ouerthroweth iustice in chastitie for first it giueth power to the pope to dispense with mariages within degrees of nature it licenseth the brother by that dispensation to marrie his brothers wife and so is a patrone of horrible incest secondly it defendeth the toleration of stewes thirdly by solemne decree it forbiddeth mariages to sundrie orders of man which paul calleth a doctrine of diuels timoth yes they binde certaine man and woman from mariage and yet call it a sacrament fourthly the last councell of trent affirmeth that all mariages not solemnized by a masse priest and in the faith of the roman church are of none effect thirdly that religion teacheth that to steale a small thing is a veniall sinne whereas the thought of stealing deserueth the curse of the law secondly it defendeth begging yes and placeth holines in it whereas the word teacheth that there should be no begger in israel fourthly it teacheth that a sporting lie or a beneficial lie are venial sins flat against the ninth commandement lastly against the tenth commandement it teacheth iniustice namely that hurtfull motions intended against our neighbour if there bee no consent of will are no sinne whence wee may see what to thinke of that religion yes christ himselfe sheweth mat whosoeuer breaketh the least of these commandements and teach man so to doe he is the least in the kingdome of heauen that is he hath no part therein but the romane church breaketh them yes and teacheth man to doe so and therefore it is not of god and the peremptorie teachers thereof haue no part without repentance in the kingdome of heauen the tenth ground is corinthian let euery man abide in that calling in which hee was called first the meaning the scope of the words sheweth that among the corinths some who were sla es and servant but couerted to the faith their masters still remaining infidel thought that now they were free from their masters and might relinquish their seruice and hence tooke occasion to liue as they listed against which conceit of licentiousnesse the apostle paul opposeth himselfe and wisheth that this be reformed and that those who being called to the faith vnder vnbeleeuers abide in that same calling wherein they were called in which verse two things are contained first that euery man that would liue religiously must haue a double calling first the generall calling of a christian secondly some particular vocation and calling wherein to conuerse secondly that euery man must abide in his particular calling which that a man may doe first he must be contented and well pleased with his calling secondly hee must walke diligently in the duties thereof for these reasons first the commandement of god genes in the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate thy bread which words though they be a threatning yet they include a commaundement bounded with a promise of blessing psalm the man that feareth god shall eate the labours of his own hands and blessed shall he be exod sixe daies shalt thou labour enforced by god owne example for in sixe daies the lord made heauen and earth quest may we not vse recreation in the sixe daies ans yes so it be moderate and help to make vs fitter for our callings for labour it selfe being commaunded euery thing also which vpholdeth it is commanded such commandements are vsuall in the new testament also ephesian let him that stole steale no more but rather let him labour with his hands the thing that good is so thess man are commanded to eate their owne bread secondly examples in the scripture god enioyned adam in the state of innocencie this double calling first to serue him secondly to dresse the garden the second adam christ himselfe while he led a priuate life till his baptisme which was the space of thirtie yeeres liued in his father iosephs calling the angels themselues are ministring spirits for the good of the godly and ascend and descend vpon the son of man and liue not out of their calling thirdly it is the ordinance of god that man should be his instruments for the commo good of the societies wherein they liue euen as euery member in the bodie endeuoureth it selfe not onely for it owne good bu for the benefit of the whole so should euery member of the bodie politic this ground is of great weight for the maintaining of the three maine societies for neither familie church nor common wealth can stand without distinction of particular callings and labour in the same for which cause the apostle would not haue him to eate that will not labour thes the aduersaries hereof are first many amongst vs as those who spend their liues in gaming and they who spend their wealth in bezeling and drink and they also who being strong to labor spend their time in begging all which are vile courses of life and enemy to all good societies secondly the roman religion first in maintaining a monkish life whereby a man cutteth himselfe off from all societie and liues in prayer and fasting but wee are taught not onely to practise duties of the first table but of the second also and without the speciall calling the generall is nothing secondly in maintaining loosenes of life and idlenes for god hauing appointed sabbaths in the yeere wherein man are to lay aside their ordinarie callings and no moe they haue added as may appeare in their callender fiftie two moe which they call holy daies and so spend more than a quarter of a yeere in rest and idlenes whereby they become aduersaries of this ground the eleuenth ground is tim keepe faith and good conscience the meaning by faith we must vnderstand the wholesome doctrine and religion deliuered in the writings of the prophets and apostles further this faith must not goe alone but must haue his companion which is a good conscience the propertie of which is to excuse and iustifie a man in al callings before god and man and it is knowne by a two fold testimonie first of the life past secondly of the life present and to come the testimony of the life past is that a man hath repented him of all his sinnes past and is turned vnto god the testimonie of the life present and to come is first that a man hath a purpose neuer to offend god but endeuours to please him in all things secondly that when hee hath slipped and sinned against go it was not wittingly and willingly but of humane infirmitie thirdly that a man hath his generall testimony which is required to a good conscience psalm i shall not be confounded when i haue respect to all thy commandements iam he that breaketh one commandement i guiltie of all that is hee that wittingly and willingly against the knowledge of his conscience breake one of the commandements of god will if occasion be offered willingly and of knowledge break them all so as a good conscience must testifie on a mans side concerning all sinnes and all obedience examples whereof we haue in hez kiah esai remember lord how i haue walked before thee with a perfect heart and in paul corinthian i know nothing by my selfe the weight of the ground appeareth in the wordes following where the apostle saith that while some put away good conscience they haue made shipwracke concerning the faith where he compareth our conscience to a ship our religion and faith to our treasures laid in it now as a hole in the ship loseth the treasures by sinking the ship so cracke the conscience and the treasures of religion suffer shipwracke whence it is that timothie is willed to keepe the mysterie of faith i pure conscience tim the aduersarie of this ground is the roman religion who ouerthroweth true testimonie of conscience which is euer ioyned with true humiliation and repentance for sinnes past in teaching that many sinnes are in themselues veniall or no sinnes as those lusts against the last commaundement which killed paul himselfe and in extenuating mans corruption and extolling nature wherby they say a man may worke his saluation being holpen by the holy ghost whereas indeede no true peace of conscience is to bee found till nature bee wholy debased amp grace take the whole place secondly they teach that a man cannot bee certaine of his saluation in this life but may coniecture and hope well which is the very racke and torment of the conscience thirdly while they teach that a man must merit his saluation by his workes they torture the conscience and leaue it destitute of this testimonie for how can the conscience quiet it selfe when it knowes not how many workes will serue the turne nor when it hath sufficiently satisfied the iustice of god and this is to bee marked that the chiefest of that religion whatsoeuer they hold in their life time yet when they lie on their death bed they flie from their owne merits to the merit of christ notable is that speech of stephen gardiner at his death to conuince it who hauing been a great persecutor and being much perplexed on his death bed by a friend of his visiting him was put in minde of that iustification which is by the meere mercy of god in christ to whom hee answered you may tell me and those who are in my case of this doctrine but open not this gap to the people so as they are glad to entertain our doctrine for the true peace of their conscience which in their owne doctrine they can neuer finde thus haue wee shewed in part that faith is a most pretious treasure beset with many enemy against whom wee must alwaies contend which wee shall yet more clearely see in beholding the vse of this treasure which is two fold first to r ueil from god vnto man all things needfull vnto saluation concerning doctrine or manners wherein it excelleth all man learning for first all the lawes and learning of man reueile the morall law only in part and mingle it with superstitions and ceremonies but they reueale no part of the gospell onely this doctrine of faith reuealeth in the full perfection both the law and gospell secondly the lawes and learning of man know nothing much lesse reueale of m ns miserie neither the cause nor the remedie thereof but this doctrine of faith knoweth and reueileth both namely the first cause to bee the sinne of our first parents and the proper and perfect remedie to be the death of christ thirdly mens lawes and learning speake at large of temporall happinesse but know nothing of eternall but this doctrine not onely knoweth the true happines of man but teacheth and describeth the readie way thereunto the second vse of this doctrine of faith is that it is a most perfect instrument of the holy ghost for the working of all graces in the hearts of man i meane not the letters and syllables but the doctrine of the prophets and apostles taught and beleeued paul calleth it the power of god to saluation and christ himselfe saith that his word is spirit and life that is the instrument of the spirit whereby life eternall is procured for which two notable vses it is a most pretious treasure whence we learne first to be swift to heare this doctrine taught in the publike ministerie as iames counselleth chap because in it god openeth his treasure to dispence the same vnto vs secondly it being a pretious treasure wee must hide the same in the coffers of our hearts psalm i haue hid thy word in my heart it must be an ingrafted word in them iam and this dutie we practise first when wee haue care to know it secondly to remember it thirdly when wee set the affections of our hearts vpon it as man do vpon their treasures thirdly if it be the treasure of the church then it bringeth to the possessors of it wealth honour and pleasure as other treasures doe for as the house of obed edom was blessed for the arke so is that heart which holdeth true wisedome within it see prou ampc we in this land haue good experience of this truth who by god blessing haue aboue fourtie yeeres enioyed wealth peace honour and aboue all god protection and whence haue these flowed but from the true faith and religion set downe in the prophets and apostles maintained and defended amongst vs which if we would haue continued we must also continue to hold and affect this truth as a treasure vnto the end the second point or head of the exhortation is that the saints are the keepers of this treasure of faith to whom it was giuen whence we may learne first that it is an infallible note of the true church of god to keep maintaine and defend the wholesome doctrine of religion deliuered by the prophets and apostles it was noted to bee the chiefe prerogatiue of the iewes that to them the oracles of god were committed roman hence tim the church is called the ground and piller of truth because in her publike ministery she maintaineth and preserueth the same cant christ where she shalbe sure of him and not mi e of finding him in her necessitie he maketh answere she shall be sure of him in the te s of shepheards whence may bee truly concluded that neither are the assemblies of turkes nor heretikes the churches of god because they fight against the truth neither is the church of rome a true church of god because the truth of doctrine is for substance reuersed amongst them as also we may be confirmed that our churches are the true churches of christ by this infallible note a register is known by his records so our church is known to be god register because it keepeth faithfully the records of the prophets and apostles secondly that it stands vs in hand to whom this treasure is now committed so faithfully to keepe it that it be not taken from vs and giuen to others who will keepe it better which we shall do by making this vse of it that wee bring foorth the fruites of it in amendement of life else our vnthankfulnes shall iustly bereaue vs of it concerning that circumstance in the text once giuen and not often it may b are a double sense first it was giuen a wee say once for all that is perfectly sufficiently as neuer after needing any alteration or addition whence wee note first that all reuelations in matter of saluation and religion giuen since are friuolous and superstitious for there is but one edition of true faith and no edition of reuelation besides or without the word such as the papists haue deuised to confirme their purgatorie prayer and almes for the dead masse ampc seeing all necessarie doctrine to saluation was once giuen perfectly secondly that all church traditions in matter of religion and doctrine of saluation are meere prophanations of true doctrine and argue it to bee vnperfect as those of the masse of receiuing the communion in one kind of the popes supremacie of workes of satisfaction and many moe secondly it may bee thus vnderstood once giuen to the saints that is not in writing but in the hearts of the saints when they are truly enlightened and therefore if after enlightening it bee quite lost it is not giuen the second time and consequently cannot be recouered heb if a man who hath bin once enlightened and tasted of the good word of god fall away it is impossible th he should be renewed againe by repentance from which wee must learne to beware of apostasie and falling from the faith yes and of al steps and degrees leading thereunto as of declining from our grounds of religion for better it been for vs neuer to haue knowne the way of truth than after the knowledge of it to forsake the holy commaundement pet which is the more to bee remembred because religion hath been more cherished than now it is and the declining from it a great deale lesse if it be asked how may wee preuent apostasie i answer neuer call any ground into question here cyprians rule is to be learned that diuine matters admit no deliberation the third point of the exhortation is the office of the church of god and euery member of it and that is to maintaine yes to the word is not but signifying an instant contention the weapons of ou warfare are not carnall corinthian fight for the maintenance of this reasure and this is not a bodilie fight by strength of arme or bow but a spirituall fight by spiritual duties which euery member of the church must take vp and namely by foure duties first by doctrine for euery man in his place and calling must be a prophet as ioel and must teach all vnder him the father must teach the children the master his servant and thus keepe out satan and al satani doctrines secondly by confession euery man being called must stand against the ga es of hell by constant witnessing of the ruth pet sanctifie god in your hearts and be ready alwaies to giue an account of the that is in you thirdly by example of a good life and vnblameable sutable to the doctrine philip this maketh man shine as lights in the world fourthly by prayer that the lord would send forth labourers into his haruest to withstand al false doctrines and heresies that so the faith and religion wherewith hee hath honoured vs these many yeeres may bee maintained vnto vs and continued vnto ours for euer the word is not but signifying an instant contention the weapons of ou warfare are not carnall corinthian here the apostle proceedeth to confirme his exhortation by a reason drawne from the state of the church in his time and it is thus briefly framed there bee certaine man which secretly seeke to vndermine and ouerthrow the faith therefore you ought the more earnestly to contend for it and that these aduersaries lurking amogst them might the better bee descried hee describeth them by fiue seuerall adiuncts first by their hypocrisie in creeping in secondly by their estate before god they are of old ordained to this condemnatio thirdly by their religion vngodly man they are fourthly by their doctrine they turne the grace of our god into wantonnes fiftly by their liues they denie the onely lord for the first there are certaine man crept in that is there be man who secretly haue insinuated themselues into your societies professing themselues to be teachers of the true faith but are indeede the destroyers and disturbe s of it in which words two sins are la d to their charge first that they cunningly ioyned themselues vnto the church pretending themselues to be the servant of christ and of the church and yet were enemy to both here marke the subtiltie of satan who causeth prophane man to ioyne themselues to the societies of the saints that by this meanes mingling his instruments with the members of the church he may by degrees corrupt the faith and ouerthrow the church the parable matth sheweth that wheresoeuer the good husbandman soweth his good seede this malicious man scattereth his tares in abrahams house shal be an ismael in isaaks an esau in the arke a cursed cham in christs familie a iudas in the primitiue church the diuell raised vp of all sorts of heretikes great numbers in our owne church the diuell stirreth vp daily troopes of atheists and papists to the corrupting and deprauing of true faith and religion vse first wee must not take offence when we see vngodly man in y e church much lesse cut our selues from it by separation but rather conceiue of the policie of satan who for the hindrance of the faith thrusteth them in when the israelites entred into the land of canaan they must not dwell alone but be mingled with the cananites the enemy of the church least y land being too much dispeopled wild beast should preuaile and deuoure the people of god so the lord ordering the malice of satan to the good of the church suffereth seducers in the church both to exercise the faith and patience of his as also to preuent greater dangers which they might in their secure condition fall into secondly hence wee see that such hypocrites as these be though they be in the church yet are they not of it they are no members of that bodie as the roman church teacheth for they onely creepe into it the second fault that is laid to their charge is that they are intruders thrusting themselues into the office of teaching not being called thereto but creepe into the calling whence wee note that it is most necessarie that those who are to teach publikely in the church should bee first called thereunto reasons first besides the auoiding of this sinne of creeping into the church it is the order that god hath set in the same that he that is to teach should first be sent rom and no man taketh this honour that is lawfully to himselfe except he be called as aaron was secondly the ministerie is god and not mans because the minister standeth in god roome and speaketh in his name which he can neuer doe truly vnlesse god send him and depute him in his stead thirdly the minister must maintaine that which he teacheth vnto which he had neede as in all the parts of his calling of god speciall protection for the which hee must bee alwaies instant in prayer which hee can neuer be assured of if he be not perswaded of the truth of his calling fourthly the people cannot heare with comfort and profit if they bee not perswaded that god hath called the teacher to instruct them rom how can they heare ampc this truth extendeth it selfe also to all other offices as well ciuill as ecclesiasticall all which are to bee welded and executed by man lawfully called vnto the same all entrance then into any office in church or common wealth by money fauour of man or any vnlawful meanes is intrusion and such are not called of god but are to be ranged among these seducers who creepe into places and come not in by god call or approbation the second adiunct whereby the seducers are described is their estate before god being man of old ordained to this condemnation that is they were before all times locked enrolled or billed vnto condemnation euen as though their names had been set downe in a booke by condemnation is meant iudgement as the particle this doth plainly shew which maketh this the plaine meaning they were of old ordained to this iudgement in this life to trie to exercise and molest the church of god and so consequently to procure vnto themselues at length their own iust condemnation in which words we are taught first that god keepeth his bookes of registrie and records in which all things are set downe the persons behauiours and eternall estate of all man which bookes are of three sorts first the booke of his prouidence containing all particulars of things past present and to come in which the lord saw the members of dauid when he was yet vnformed psalm in the same booke the number of the haires of our heads and the falling of sparrowes to the ground are recorded the second booke is of the last iudgement in which the persons and sinnes of all man al enrolled daniel the thrones were set vp the ancient of daies did sit thousand thousands ministred vnto him and enne thousand thousands stood before him the iudgement was set and the bookes opened reu i saw all great and small stand before god and the bookes were opened and another booke was opened the third is the booke of life in which are written the names of those who are to be saued philipp paul saith of clement and other his fellowe labourers that their names were written in the booke of life now by these books we may not grossely conceiue materiall bookes such as man note what they would remember in but the counsell election prouidence pleasure and knowledge of god wherein all these things are so certainly set downe as if any man should write them in a booke out of which wee note two things first that in regard of god there is no chance neither any euent by it in regard of man indeed who know not the causes of things many chances may be but god prouidence and chance are contrarie he hauing all things written before him with their causes secondly that nothing comes to passe without the decree of god no not the wicked actions of man which god not onely foreseeth but decreeth for this iude insinuateth saying they were ordained to this iudgement and euen that which is against the will of god commeth not to passe without his will god willing the being of that which he willeth not to effect and though hee esteeme not euill to be good yet hee accounteth it good that euill should be further where hee saith ordained of old to this condemnation we learne that as god hath before all worlds decreed the electing of some to saluation so he hath decreed the refusall and reiecting of others to condemnation pet many were disobedient vnto the which they were euen ordained thess god hath not ordained you to wrath but to obtaine saluation through christ shewing that some are ordained to wrath who are not to obtaine saluation through christ rom god is compared to a potter framing vessels of honour and dishonour vessels of mercie and vessels of wrath in the same place i haue loued iacob and hated esau that is i haue decreed so to doe for the whole chapter speaketh of god counsel amp vnchangeable decree ob if this be so will some say then god dealeth iniustly that absolutely ordaineth some man to condemnation and perdition ans we must know that wee are creatures and may not presume to prescribe a law of iustice to the creator whose will is iustice it selfe whatsoeuer we may conceiue and maketh the things willed good because it is willed and not willed because it is good secondly though god refuse and reiect man yet hee doth it in most wise order and iust proceeding in these two degrees first hee vouchsafeth to some man the riches of his grace tending to life euerlasting which speciall abundant grace hee denieth to some other passing by them who being left of him vnto themselues fall into sinne secondly for sin god decreeth iudgement and condemnation so as he doth not simply and absolutely ordaine his creature to hell but in regard of sinne not that sinne is a cause of the decree moouing him vnto it but that hee decreeth not condemnation without respect of sinne and relation vnto it which speech wee neede not feare to speake because the holie ghost so speaketh vse first if some man be passed by of god we must humble our selues vnder his mightie hand and with feare and trembling worke our saluation roman some are cut off thou standest by faith be not high minded but feare secondly wee may not be offended when we see the gospell not receiued yes hated of man and the professors of it persecuted for many are of old ordained to be vnderminers of the truth euen to this condemnation which by disobedience they hasten vpon themselues if the gospell be hid to any it is to them that perish thirdly many diuines ouershoot themselues that seeke to obscure or ouerthrow this doctrine of reprobation teaching that god for his part electeth all and that man himselfe is the cause of reprobation so as man is either the sauiour or damner of himselfe by receiuing or refusing grace offered whereas the scripture speaketh otherwise and here teacheth vs that some man were enrolled to certen iudgement by god before all worlds the darkning of this doctrine breedeth securitie of spirit wherein grace is made so large and saluation so easie that if man will they may be saued whereas our doctrine leadeth to the feare of god and a care to walke as in his presence continually lastly in that it is added they were preordained of old note first the time of the reiection of some man namely before all worlds secondly the proper cause of the decree of god which must needes be in himselfe because it was before the creature was rom before they had done good or euill that is before he considered of their good or euill in his decree he decreed to loue the one and hate the other so ephesian whom hee chuseth he chuseth in himselfe not informing his iudgement nor framing his counsels as man doth from outward respects he goeth not out of himselfe for any motiue to chuse or refuse but as matth because his good pleasure was such this confuteth the popish error which affirmeth that god did decree according to his foresight of faith or infidelitie the sauing of some and refusing of other but this cannot stand seeing god decree is in order and time before the creature which being the latter cannot bee the cause of the former the third adiunct or property of these seducers is their want of religion vngodly man they are vngodlines is a sinne much spoken of but not so wel known and therefore it is requisite to shew the nature of it that wee may know who an vngodly man is the rather because it is a grieuous sinne much greater than any of the seauen deadly sins of the papists being the ground of them all secondly because it is rooted in the bottome of the heart and cannot be so easily discerned as others though as dangerous as any thirdly because it is a sinne more spirituall against the first commandement of the first table directed against god himselfe robbing him of his due honour for the cleere knowledge of which consider three maine parts or properties of vngodlinesse first that it denieth god the honour due vnto him and that three waies first by ignorance it causeth the vngodly man to rob him of his honour in that he acknowledgeth not the godhead but in his heart he inwardly denieth the prouidence the presence the iustice mercie power and the other attributes of god psalm the thought of the heart of the foole that is of euery vngodly man is that there is no god not that in conscience he is not conuinced of the contrarie but by reason of his wicked heart vpon occasion offered he is willing to acknowledge none secondly by not subiecting the conscience and life to the written will and word of god but reiecting and renouncing subiection thereunto thus iob bringeth in the vngodly man saying to the almightie depart from vs wee will haue none of thy waies which is too outragious to ee the speech of the tongue but of the heart casting off the lord yoke to whom the king shall say those mine enemy that would not haue mee to raigne ouer them bring them hither and slay them before me luke thirdly by not lifting vp the heart by inuocation of god for blessings needfull and in thanksgiuing for benefits receiued the property of the vngodly man is that he calleth not vpon god psalm this point of atheisme maketh a man like a beast which looketh not vp from whece his food falleth the second propertie of vngodlines is to attribute and giue this honour which it denieth god vnto some thing else than god as when the vngodlie man setteth his loue ioy feare or any other affection vpon any thing besides god thus the couetous man becommeth an idolater and tim in the last times man shall be louers of pleasures more than of god the third propertie of it is when it giueth god his due honour to denie him the true manner which causeth the vngodly man to content himselfe with a forme and shew of godlines outwardly bearing himselfe as godly but inwardly wanteth the power of it the heart is not single but full of fraud of doubling and deceit before god who looketh into it and delighteth not with the approching of the lippes when the heart is remoued by which wee see the practise of the vngodly man sundrie waies robbing god of his due honour which one sinne entertained breedeth and nourisheth sinnes of all sorts and so much wee are giuen to vnderstand in the placing of it here as the first sinne of the seducers producing a great number of sins more noted in them through the epistle neither can any other be looked for but that the life should be plentifull in all sinnes where the heart is possessed of this vngodlines rom the gentiles acknowledged not god and therfore he gaue them vp to vile affections and this was the ground of all those sins reckoned there aboue twentie in number abraham thought not amisse that he might easily bee slaine for sarah his wife whom therefore he durst not confesse if the feare of god were not in abimilech court genes giuing vs to know that where the feare of god is not in the heart there is no bones made of any sinne in the life no not of murther it selfe vse wee are hence taught to spie out in our selues this hidden and secret sinne and heartily to bewaile it aboue all other sinnes as the mother sinne of the rest but some may say we are not tainted with this sinne we abhorre to be counted vngodly ans it is too common a sinne among all sorts wee haue indeede an outward forme of godlines we come to heare the word to pray to receiue the sacraments but the most want the power of it in their hearts for first the lawes binde our outward man to this outward forme but the hearts of man remaine secure seldome thinking of their sinne and damnable estate by it and seldome sorrowing for the same and saying what haue we done secondly many haue the forme of godlinesse whose hearts are filled with the cares of this life which choke vp the power of godlinesse and will not suffer it to fea e it self there seeing the loue of the world and the loue of god cannot stand together thirdly many hauing this forme cannot abide to subiect their hearts and liues vnto the lawes of god yes they would exempt their speeches and affections from such strictnes and count it too much precisenes these are al fruites of the vngodly heart of which the fewer wee can see in our selues the more they be and the more to be bewailed vse further hence wee are to take out that lesson which the apostle teacheth tim to exercise our selues vnto godlinesse for if vngodlinesse bee such a mother sinne we must endeuour our selues to the contrarie for which purpose we must first prepare our selues thereunto else wee shall faile in the whole exercise by learning to acknowledge god prouidence presence mercie and iustice in euery thing gal when the galathians know not god they worshipped them which by nature were no god no godlinesse can stand with the ignorance of god neither can it be exercised in particular actions vnlesse we behold him thus in the particulars secondly to this exercise of godlinesse wee must first inwardly worship god in our spirits soules hearts amp affections not in lips only speeches amp outward actions for the ioh right worshippers worship him in spirit and truth paul rom serued god in his spirit qu how shall a man doe this ans true inward worshippe standeth in two things first in faith secondly in the actions of faith faith is that whereby a man generally beleeueth the whole word of god containing the law and the gospell to be the truth of god it selfe and particularly concerning himselfe three things first god mercie in the forgiuing of his owne sinnes secondly his presence in all his actions thirdly his prouidence ouer all euents good or bad that befall him the actions of faith are two first subiection of the heart vnto god in three respects first to god iudgement that seeing hee passeth sentence against our sinnes we also should call our selues to account for them confesse them condemne our selues for them and intreate for mercie secondly to his word and lawes of both tables by heartie and conscionable obedience willingly taking vp his yoke amp suffering our selues to be directed by all his lawes thirdly to the good pleasure of god knowne by the euent whether sicknes or health want or abundance in departing from our owne wils and patiently yes thankfully submitting them vnto his blessed will the second action of faith is the eleuation or lifting vp of the heart vnto god incessantly both in suing for his grace and aide in the seasonable supplie of our necessities as also in blessing him for blessings receiued in these stand the practise of the true worship of god in the spirit which is true godlinesse vnto which wee may be incited by these reasons first because this godlinesse hath the promise of this life and the life to come tim that is the godly man hath title to all blessings of all kindes secondly godlines is great gaine timoth euery man affecteth gaine but if any man would attaine it let him bee godlie man are often crossed in the world and things succeede not with them they are not prospered in their callings and duties of it and seeing no reason of it marueile why they should not thriue as well as others whereas indeede being vngodly man they want that which should bring in their gaine thirdly le the consideration of the last iudgement ioyned with the dissolution of heauen and earth moue vs hereunto pet seeing all these things shall be dissolued what manner of persons ought we to be in holy co rsation and godlines as though h had said seeing nothing else shall stand v in stead but godlines how are we to our selues to the practise of it fourthly the appearing of grace teacheth vs to denie all vngodlines and to liue in this present world tit if this be the end of the gospels appearing and we ha e been they to whom hath appeared with peace and prosperitie aboue fourtie yeeres how can wee bee but vnexcuseable and speechlesse before god if wee remaine vntaught in this dutie but continue still in the waies of vngodlinesse the fourth adiunct whereby the seducers are described is their doctrine in these words they turne the grace of god to wantonnes in which consider two points first the sinne or vice here condemned secondly the du ie or contrarie vertue commanded before wee can know the former we must search out the meaning of the words and first by grace is meant the doctrine of the gospel called in the former verse by the name of faith so it is called titus the grace of god hath appeared teaching vs ampc because it teacheth vs that remission of sinnes and life euerlasting are obtained onely by the meere grace of god in christ by wantonnes is properly vnderstood that sinne whereby man addict themselues wholie to intemperance incontinencie and vnlawful pleasures but here it must be taken generally for a licentious prophane kinde of liuing and libertie of sinning turne that is they displace the grace of god applying it from a right to a wrong end and that not onely in practise of life but in propounding of doctrine tending thereunto as though hee had more plainly said that whereas the doctrine of grace in the gospell teacheth man free iustification by faith in christ without the workes of the law these man peruert this gratious doctrine and teach that therefore man may liue as they list and so themselues doe also by which same sinne such seducers are elsewhere noted in the scripture rom some gathered from pauls doctrine the same libertie saying why doe wee not then euill that good ay come of it and pet some such are mentioned who beguiled diverse with wantonnes through th lusts of the flesh promising vnto them libertie ecclesiasticall history mention in any such who sprung vp after the apostles daies the libertines simon magus and his disciples who ught that man might lawfully commit fornication so also the disciples of a ilides eu omius and the osticks heretikes who taught that man might liue as they list seeing ow such libertie was procured them being freed from being vnder the law any longer which sinne died not with those cursed heretikes but the diuell hath in these last daies reuiued it especially in foure sorts of man first the libertines of this age who hold with the former that being vnder grace wee are free from the obedience of the law secondly the anabaptists who vpon the consideratio of abundant grace amp peace in the new testament and of the libertie obtained by christ teach that ciuill iurisdiction and magistracie is unlawful as also to make war and to take an oth before a magistrate which sort of man are not so well knowne here as in other churches but are daungerous enemy wheresoeuer both to the grace of god and good of man for where the ciuill sword doth cease there can no societie stand in safetie thirdly another kind of libertines are the papists and the popish church with the whole romane religion themselues being open enemy vnto the grace of god and their whole religion turning it into wantonnes and libertie of sinning and that diverse waies first god hauing of his grace giuen vnto the church a power of the keyes to open and shut heauen that religion hath turned it into an instrument first of prophanenesse in setting vp an new priesthood to absolue and lose man sins properly in offer a sacrifice for the quicke and the dead so abolishing the sacrifice of christ secondly of iniustice for by it they depose kings and princes they free subiects from their alleageance they stirre them vp and encourage them to conspiracies rebellions and maintaine in other states factions ciuill war and seditions and al by vertue of their power thirdly of horrible couetousnes for by it they sell pardons for thousands of yeeres the which sales haue brought to the church of rome the third part of the reuenewes of al europe which one practise if there were no moe prooueth plainly that that church turneth the grace of god to the libertie of sinne secondly their whole religion is a corrupted religion and maketh the receiuers of it the children of satan more than before for first it maketh man hypocrites requiring nothing but an externall bodily and ceremoniall worship without any inward power of it as in fasting it requireth onely a shew of it as to abstaine from flesh and white meates but they may vse most delicate fish the strongest wines and sweetest spice and in other parts of their religion is no lesse hypocriticall secondly it maketh man proud and arrogant teaching the freedome of will vnto good if the holie ghost doe but a little help it that a man can merit by his workes that hee can satisfie god iustice by suffering for sin yes that hee can performe some workes of supererrogation who can hold these points and be humble thirdly it maketh man secure teaching that they may haue full pardon of all their sins by the power of their keyes for money and that though they haue no merits of their owne they may buy the merits of other man yes although in their death they faile of repentance yet for some money they may be eased in purgatorie what shall any rich man now care how he liue or die seeing all shall be well with him for a little money fourthly it maketh man in their distresse desperate teaching that no man can be assured of his saluation without some reuelation fiftly it reuiueth the old sinne of these seducers teaching that diverse man and woman may not marrie that were adulterie and yet openly tolerating stues and vncleannes which what is it else but to maintaine wantonnes whereby the chiefe teachers of that church witnesse themselues the right successors not of the apostles as they pretend but of these seducers and other wicked heretikes old and new the fourth sort of libertines are carnall and formall protestant who first turne the counsell of god election into wantonnes by reasoning thus if i be elected to saluation i shall be saued let me liue as i will or if not i cannot be saued doe what i will or can because god counsels are vnchangeable and thus conclude to spend their daies in all wantonnes secondly they turne the mercie of god into wantonnes thus reasoning in their hearts because god is mercifull therefore i will deferre my repentance as yet for at what time soeuer a sinner repenteth god will put away all his sins out of his remembrance what yong saints old diuels thus the timely acceptance of god mercie offered is become a reproch besides many moe who because the lord deferreth punishment set their hearts to doe euill thirdly others vnder pretence of brotherly loue mispend all that they haue in wantonnes riot excesse company keeping gaming to the beggering of themselues and vndoing of their owne families vnto which they ought to shew their loue in the first place fourthly others vnder pretext that the iewish sabbath is abrogated and that christ hath brought such libertie as hath abolished distinctions of times take libertie to keepe no sabbath at all whence many tradesmen will do what they list on this day and dispatch those businesses which they can finde no time for in the weeke daies fiftly some because they would humble themselues commit diverse sins and continue in others these say in themselues let vs continue in sinne that grace may abound all these sortes of man turne the grace of god into wantonnes and practise the vice here condemned the thing to be considered is the contrary vertue and y is to make a godly amp holy vse of the grace of god and to applie it to the right end for which god vouchsafeth it vnto vs to wit that wee might be thankful vnto him and testifie the same in obedience to all his lawes which appeareth first by testimonie of scripture luke we are deliuered of the hands of our spirituall enemy to serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse rom we are vnder grace therefore let vs giue vp the members of our body weapons of righteousnesse tit the grace of god hath appeared teaching vs to denie vngodlines secondly the end of all god graces is that wee should be furthered in holinesse of life we are elected that wee might be holy the end of our calling is that we may be saints iustification freeth from punishment of sinne sanctification from corruption and sinne it selfe faith purifieth the heart loue containeth vs in obedience he that hath hope purgeth himselfe and so of all other graces thirdly christ is a mediatour two waies first by merit to procure life and worke our saluation secondly by efficacie that is whereby his death is powerfull to cause vs to die to sinne and his resurrection to raise vs from the graue of sinne to a new life and he is no mediatour by his merit to those who are destitute of this efficacie vse we haue in this land been many yeeres partakers of this grace of god our dutie then is to make a holie vse of it and walke thankfully before god rom i beg you by the mercies of god which he had in the former chapter mentioned that ye giue vp your selues a holie sacrifice to god no more forcible argument can be vrged to stirre vp man to thankfull obedience than this for if god mercie in christ cannot mooue what will let this then perswade vs likewise if we beleeue god to bee our father that is a great grace let this grace moue vs to walke as children before him let the grace of our redemption mooue vs to walke as redeemed ones rescued out of such captiuitie wherein wee were inthralled to sin and satan seeing it were a madnes to returne to such bondage againe if christ be dead for vs let that grace moue vs to die to sinne if hee being risen againe sit at god right hand that wee might sit there with him let that grace mooue vs to walk as those that are risen with him and haue our conuersation in heauen seeking euen while wee are below the things that are aboue and so of the rest further the apostle to make those seducers more odious saith not simplie they turne the grace of god but of our god into wantonnes which noteth the indignitie of their fact in which consider three things first by what meanes god becomes our god and that is not by any merit of ours but by meanes of the gratious couenant propounded in the gospell promising pardon and remission of sin in and by christ iere this is called the new couenant which the lord contracteth with his people where writing his law in their inward parts he becommeth their god and they his people secondly what must wee doe to say truly and in assurance that god is our god ans wee must for our parts make a couenant with him vnto which is required a consent on either partie first on god part that he will be our god which we shall finde not in any reuelation besides the scriptures but generally in the word and more specially in the ministerie of the gospell and administration of the sacraments annexed as seales vnto the couenant in which god doth as surely couenant with vs as if hee should from heauen speake vnto vs secondly on our part is required consent of which there be two degrees first when we make an outward profession of faith heare the word receiue the sacraments baptisme and the lord supper which serue to distinguish vs from iewes turkes ampc this is somewhat but not sufficient to make god our god seeing it is common to the very hypocrites themselues secondly seeing hee is not a iew which is one outwardly but which is a iew within there is required in our consent a further degree which standeth in an inward consent of the heart whereby a man taketh god for his god which is then begun when first a man acknowledgeth and bewaileth his sinnes secondly when he endeuoureth to bee reconciled to god thirdly when he purposeth neuer to sin againe when this couenant is thus concluded by consent of both parties a man may safely and truly say that god is his god now seeing wee know these things our dutie is to labour to be setled and assured in our conscience that god is our god for first in this assurance is the foundation of all true comfort all the promises of god are hereupon grounded and herein accomplished that god is our god see isai be not afraid i am thy god yes christ being vpon the crosse hauing the pangs of hel vpon him herein staied himselfe my god my god so dauid psalm and being readie to be stoned to death comfort d himselfe in the lord his god sam and not onely is it the foundation of all our comfort in this life but of our happines after death it selfe being the ground of those two maine articles of our faith the resurrection of the bodie and the immortalitie of the soule for by vertue of this couenant alone shall wee rise againe after death to life glorie and immortalitie as christ himselfe disputing against the sadduces from hence prooueth the resurrection in that god is the god of abraham isaac and iacob secondly it is the ground of al obedience psalm the prophet exhorting man thereunto vseth this as a reason for he is the lord our god and wee are the people of his hands the preface of the morall law enforcing obedience laieth the same ground for i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt see also psalm and whosoeuer is truly perswaded that god is his god cannot but obey him the fift propertie of these seducers is that they deny god the onely lord and our lord iesus christ thus are they described by their manners the translators of this epistle were as it seemeth of opinion that these words are properly spoken of god the father and of god the son also but by the tenour of the words in the originall it seemeth that they are all to bee vnderstood of christ and not of the father and are thus to be read which denie that onely ruler who is god and our lord iesus christ again the tenour of the words being borrowed from the epistle of peter may thence be rightly expounded now peter speaking of the same sinne of these seducers applieth it only to be a denial of christ pet they denie the lord that bought them in the words then consider two things first the sinne here condemned namely to denie iesus christ secondly a description of christ for the first to denie iesus christ is to renounce and forsake christ and so much as in a man lieth to make his death voyd and of none effect now because this deniall presupposeth a redemption as peter mentioneth they denying the lord that bought them this question is to be cleered how these man being reprobates can be said to bee redeemed by christ answer wee must not thinke that they were in god decree euer redeemed for then had they been saued he doing whatsoeuer he willeth psalm but it is to be meant in regard of themselues and other man for both in their owne conceit amp iudgement they were redeemed as also in the iudgement of others who are to bee led by the rule of charitie in passing their iudgement vpon man and to account of them as redeemed leauing all secret iudgements to god secondly the description of christ by three things first that he is a ruler yes an only ruler a lord and ruler ouer all things in generall in heauen earth and hell and more specially a lord ouer his elect onely and in that he is said to be an onely ruler it must not bee meant as excluding the father and holie ghost but all false god and false christs as ioh the father is called the onely god for all outward actions of the trinitie are common to all the persons secondly that hee is god which is a notable place against all arrians to prooue the godhead of christ thirdly he is said to be our lord ours in two respects especially first of the free donation of his father who gaue to him a people to be lord and king ouer before all worlds secondly in regard of his worke of redemption which hee wrought for them who were of the father giuen vnto him out of that which hath bin here said we may note these two points first how these seducers denie christ namely not openly and plainly for then the church should haue espied them neither in word nor speech for in word they professed him but in their deedes denied him liuing after their owne lusts and encourage others in the same course titus and this sinne is reuiued and renewed in this our age wherein too many outwardly and in word professe christ come to the word and sacraments but couertly and in their deedes denie him whose liues are very full of epicurisme and earthlines and mouthes filled with blasphemies and reproches against true obedience which of them is counted too much nicenes and precisenes these are the disciples of the old heretiques whom without repentance the like fearefull iudgements awaite which befell them secondly we may obserue in what regards they deny christ namely first in regard of his godhead by withstanding the meanes of that power of christ whereby hauing redeemed them he would sanctifie their hearts to obedience the merit of his redemption is welcome to them but they will none of the efficacie of it which sanctifieth and reneweth the inner man subdueth sinne and quickneth the life of god in them secondly in regard of his lordship by denying him obedience which as to a lord is due vnto him a redeemer they would haue him but not a lord so euery man would haue portion in christs redemption but their lusts must be their lord and they servant to sinne and satan but these bee those enemy that will not that he should raigne ouer them who shall be brought and slaine before him our part then is if euer wee would finde comfort in christ to make him our lord his counsell is that those that are laden should come vnto him for ease but the next words are take my yoke vp thee and if wee would haue him our iustification let him become also our sanctification the apostle hauing propounded his principall exhortation to contend and fight for the faith verse with the reason thereof verse doth here begin to answere a secret obiection which might bee made against that reason thus these seducers professe christ and looke for saluation by him what danger then can redound if we should ioyne our selues vnto them this obiection is answered from this fifth verse vnto the twentith in all which verses hee disputeth at large that there is great daunger herein seeing their end shall be destruction the summe of which disputation is contained in this reason all such persons as giue themselues libertie to sinne shal be destroyed but these seducers giue themselues libertie to sinne and therefore shall be destroyed the former part of which reason is contained in the verses and the latter from the vnto the the former proposition is not plainly set downe in so many words but the proofe of it onely by an induction and enumeration of examples of sinners which haue bin destroyed and they be three in number first of the israelites in the verse secondly of the angels in the verse thirdly of sodom and gomorrha in the verse in this verse are two things to bee considered first the preface in these words i will therefore put you in remembrance for as much as you once kn w this secondly the first example whereby the point in hand is prooued in the words following the preface serueth to preuent an obiection which might be made by the church reading these examples that iude teacheth them nothing but things which they knew well enough before to which he answereth that his intent is not to teach them any new thing or any vnknowne thing but to bring knowne things to their remembrance and in it three things are to bee obserued first the apostles practise i will therefore put you in remembrance where note the office of all pastors and teachers which is not onely to teach thing vnknowne but to repeate and to bring into remembrance things known before this was peters care pet though they had knowledge to put them in remembrance and chap to stirre vp and war e their pure mindes giuing vs to vnderstand that knowledge in the minde lieth as embers vnder ashes and needes daily stirring vp which admonisheth all hearers not to be offended if they heare the same thing often seeing it is the dutie of ministers to teach the same thing often yes hearers which haue vnderstanding in the scriptures must be content if they heare nothing but that which they haue bin out of the scriptures acquainted with before seeing the apostle thinketh it meet to teach nothing else secondly in this preface obserue the propertie of the church which is to know the history and examples of scripture christ commanded his hearers to search the scriptures the apostle wisheth that the scriptures dwell plentiously in m n which exhortations no doubt stirred them vp to haue the scriptures familiar vnto them euen as timothie knew the scriptures of a childe the state of our times is farre otherwise for ministers cannot say as iude speaketh for as much as you know these things i will put you in remembrance but our people pleade and professe ignorance yes that the knowledge of the scriptures belongeth not vnto them they being not booke learned but to schollers and ministers that liue by it but wee ought to account it a propertie of euery saint of god who is iustified and sanctified to know the scriptures which onely are able to make them wise vnto saluation the third point in the preface is a second propertie of the saints namely that they once know that is they know certainly vnchangeably and once for all neuer to reuoke or alter this knowledge which first informeth vs what to thinke and iudge of those man who because of diuersitie of opinions will be of no religion nor beleeue any thing vntill it be determined by some generall councell these want this propertie of the saints and are plaine atheists secondly it teacheth vs to hold our religion certainly receiuing it once for all vnchangeably in humane things wee may often without danger chaunge our mindes and deliberate but grounds of religion must be out of al question and admit no deliberation now followeth the first example whereby the first part of the former reason is prooued and that is of the israelites who wittingly and willingly sinning against god were destroyed as appeareth numb in which example consider foure things first who were destroyed the people secondly the time when after that hee had deliuered them out of egypt thirdly for what cause which beleeued not fourthly the manner of the speech for the first the persons who were destroyed were the people by which word is meant a speciall people a peculiar and chosen people the seede of abraham isaac and iacob a people priuiledged aboue all people of the earth to whom belonged the couenant sacrifices worshippe of whom christ came according to the fles rom and notwithstanding all which prerogatiues the lord destroyed them if it had been a heathen people against whom this destruction had preuailed it had been worthie obseruation but much more when it is against god owne people here then we learne that no outward priuiledge can auaile vs nor any o ward meanes of saluation bee effectuall or fruitful to our good out of their right vse in faith and repentance rom circumcision is nothing vnlesse thou keepe the law gal neither circumcision auaileth nor vncircumcision but a new creature iudas had many great priuiledges and yet perished this made paul though he had many priuiledges to account them all as dung in regard of the knowledge of christ philipp we must not then content our selues with the meanes of saluation in the word and sacraments but vse them aright in faith and repentance otherwise they being out of their holy vse enioyed shall turne to our destruction and greater condemnation as they did to this people who notwithstanding them were destroied the second thing in the example is the time when the israelites were destroyed that is after their deliuerance out of egypt god had diuersly testified his loue to this people hauing chosen them out of all the people of the earth he called himselfe their god and hee gaue them many pledges of his loue but especially in that their great deliuerance out of the bondage of egypt by such an outstretched arme yet for all this not long after they sinning against him hee destroyed them whence learne that after many great blessings man not walking worthie of them but prouoking the lord by their sins commeth a great vengeance the whole booke of the iudges is a worthie proofe of this truth where wee shall see the people still forgetting their deliuerance and are forthwith left to tyrants to bee afflicted for tenne twentie fourtie yeeres together the same appeareth in the common wealth of israel vnder the kings in the daies of salomon the state was most florishing and glorious enioying a most happie peace but salomon once forgetting the lord and his commandements and falling to the idolatry of his outlandish wiues there followed most fearefull accidents as the diuision and rent of the tenne tribes from iudah a long dissention and hot war between reh boam and ieroboam whose idolatries brought much euill vpon their seuerall lands and at last vtter desolation the tenne tribes being carried into syria captiues and there ended their daies the other two tribes into babylon and there remained yeeres which iudgements ouertook them about yeeres after iacob when hee went ouer iordan made a vow to the lord that if god would blesse him and giue him but food and raiment he would in way of thankfulnes returne to the lord the tenth part of his goods gen god blesseth him so farre as hee became a mightie man hauing the substance of a prince in this abundance he forgat his vow or neglected it but what followed of it was there not horrible confusion in his familie dina was deflowred ruben ascended to his fathers bed hamor was slaine and the lord is glad to call to minde hi vow gen vse this doctrine concerneth vs neerely in this land who by god mercie haue enioyed many of his best blessings in this our long peace hauing bin deliuered from the egypt of rome and haue vnder the lord protection all the day long but as ou blessings haue been and are many and great so haue been and are our rebellions raging amongst vs especially that sinne of falling from our first loue so as l sse loue of god and religion is to bee found amongst vs than heretofore besides that our peace causeth man to make their heauen here vpon earth and to embrace and affect things below these sins vnrepented of will bring vpon vs daies of affliction wee hauing no more priuiledge than this people had who after their deliuerance were destroyed the third point in this destruction is the cause of it namely because they beleeued not here first obserue what kind of vnbeleefe this was to the answere of which we must know that first god had promised to abraham that after yeeres hee would giue to his posteritie the land of canaan for their inheritance this promise they all knew well inough secondly it was often repeated amp renued and namely to moses vnto whom the lord promised that he should be their guide yes and that himselfe would pro ect them in their iournie and safely conduct them thither thirdly god sealed this promise by many and sundrie signes and miracles both in egypt at the red sea and in the wildernesse yet for all this they beleeued not that god would accomplish these promises vnto them to bring them to that good land and further seeing the land of canaan was a type of that heauenlie canaan they beleeued not that god would bring them to heauen and giue them inheritance in that eternall rest by meanes of the messias this vnbeleefe then of the promises of god was the cause of their destruction secondly why are they destroyed for vnbeleefe rather then for their murmuring fornication and diverse other sinnes which we reade of to haue been rise among them ans although they murmured blasphemed tempted god reuiled their guides ampc yet this sinne of vnbeleefe was the foundation and ground of them all the which doth the more displease god in that it was the first sinne that euer was in the world and the mother of all transgression secondly this sinne in a more speciall manner dishonoreth god in making him a lyer and so toucheth his honour more neerely thirdly what was this destruction an it was the destruction of their soules and body for their carcasses were left in the wildernesse where they fell and their soules haue their portion in the lake prepared for vnbeleeuers revelation for the fur her hatred of this sinne see kings the prince who would not beleeue the word of the lord was troden to death and moses not waiting but failing in his faith was barred the land of canaan and onely saw it a farre off vse seeing destruction followeth vnbeleefe we must labour to see our vnbele fe and take out that exhortation heb take heede least there be in any of vs an euill heart of vnbeleefe to depart away from the liuing god which place well considered sheweth what are the degrees of falling away which are studiously to bee declined as first when a man is deceiued by sin and giueth himselfe libertie thereunto secondly when the heart is hardened and made an euill heart thirdly when infideliti taketh possession of the hart to rule it and cause it to call in question god promises and prouidence fourthly then followeth apostasie and departure from god now wee must beware of the least and lowest of these degrees of this defection and departure from god secondly if they were destroyed for vnbeleefe wee must on the contrarie exercise our faith daily and inure it in the daily apprehension of god prouidence power protection iustice and mercie and thus walking vndismaid we which haue thu beleeued shall enter into the rest prepared for the people of god when as many shall not enter for vnbeleefes sake heb and euen as caleb and iosua only entred into that good land because they beleeued that god could and would bring his people thither thirdly this must teach vs obedience for vpon this ground that they were destroyed for vnbeleefe dauid inferreth this cosequent psalm to day therefore if y heare his voyce harden not your hearts which moses also maketh the ground of his exhortation to the people o feare the lord because destroyed for vn eleefe deut ampc fou hly in that destruction of bodie and soule followes of vnbeleefe let such persons as when iudgements are vpon themselues wiues or children runne to witches and wizards for ease as though they were bewitched and make that the ground of their harmes bee enformed that their owne wretched hearts haue bewitched them which being full of vnbeleefe bring plagues of al kinds not onely vpon their body but their soules also article thou strangely diseased the witch that hath brought it vpon thee is thy owne wicked heart which knoweth not to relie it selfe on god promises and protection fiftly were they destroyed because of their vnbeleefe let not vs iudge of our sinnes by the crooked rule of our owne reason but by the law of god wee can iudge murther theft and adulterie great sins but wee neuer espie the mother sin of all which is our infidelitie the maine sinne of the first table and the nurcerie of other sins we neuer bewaile it we account lightly of it and therefore the lord taketh the reuenge of this sin into his owne hands and punisheth it with destruction both of soule and bodie so odious it is in his eyes and ought therefore to bee as hainous in ours also the fourth thing in the example is the manner of the speech which at the first seemeth to bee generall as though all they had been destroyed which beleeued not whereas indeed it is special for all that beleeued not were not destroyed seeing that all vnder twentie yeeres were exempted and saued number who were reserued that god might still haue his church among the and that there might be of them a people left to possesse the good land according to the promise where note that to bee true which habacu ke ascribeth to god that in his iustice he remembr th mercie by which mercie the younger so are here spared which warranteth vs to pray in common iudgements that the lord powre not ou his whole wrath vpon vs neither in our temptations vtterly forsake vs and giue vs ouer to satans malice seeing hee hath manifested such goodnes towards his church that in iudgements he h th remembred his m rcie but here it may bee asked this can stand with equitie that e en th se man should bee destroyed for it seemeth that they repented of this sin numb yes they confessed it and mourned for it and offered to passe into canaan yes and were very readie to hasten into the land ans they repented indeed but fainedly it was farre from true and sincere repentance and sorrow for euen in the very same place it appeareth that they disobeyed god for when he had passed sentence against their sin commanding that they should returne into the wildernes of arabia verse and there abide fourtie yeeres and die there they would not submit themselues to that sentence but in all haste they would goe forward to canaan according to the promise although against a particular commandement yes moses himselfe could not stay them but that brought on their neckes a more speedie destruction as appeareth in the end of the chapter whence note the wicked nature of the deceitfull heart of man which in distresse when god hand is stretched out against it can faine a false repentance and counterfeite humiliation which causeth many a man in sicknes to vow amendement of life if euer god raise him againe and yet as soone as the scourge is ouerpassed he forgetteth the hand of god his owne vowes and promises and falleth backe into the same bad courses againe which consideration may mooue vs to watch ouer our hearts and suspect them of this deceit whereby they can frame and faine a false repentance when indeede there is nothing lesse then soundnes in it the fifth point in this iudgement is the generall vse of it namely that wee should frame our selues to repentance for this particular sin of vnbeliefe vpon which we behold such a fearefull destruction in god owne people to the practise and performance of which we must doe foure things first laying aside the common perswasion of the fulnes of perfection of our faith we must come to the discerning of this sin in our selues which is the first step to repent of it and the rather because it is our mother sin now because this sinne is so inward and secret and so hardly to be discerned for our helpe herein some directions may be giuen for the especiall of it in some signes and fruites thereof which euery man shall find in himselfe lesse or more for first we beleeue not as we ought the particular presence of god in all places and times towards vs for we are ashamed to doe and speake many things in the presence of man which in the presence of god man not being by wee make no bones of either to speake or doe so as mans presence keepeth vs in some awe which god presence cannot doe secondly wee beleeue not the particular prouidence of god watching ouer vs but either not regard it at all or not as wee ought which appeareth by these three things first if wee haue health wealth friends fauour amp means we are well contented we can think our selues very well and can then relie our selues on god but if god take these away oh th n wee are troubled much disquieted and discontented the reason whereof is because the heart is not setled in the perswasion of god special prouidence which if it haue a pledge of god can trust him otherwise not at all but as the vsurer trusteth not the man but his pawne so man relying themselues on these pledges trust neither god himselfe nor for himselfe secondly in any distresse let our friend promise vs helpe wee are well cheered but let god in his word promise supply of all good and ease in our troubles we reape little or no comfort from thence this is a manifest fruite of inbred vnbeleefe thirdly in sicknes or any iudgement any meanes is vsed for case and freedome yes there is too common running and riding to witches charmers cunning man and woman for man waite not on god nor expect the same hand in healing them which hath smitten them he that beleeueth maketh not haste saith the prophet which if it be true then this hastines to be disburdened of the hand of god is a token of distrustfulnes of god and want of faith nay this practise argueth not only want of a true faith but a presence of a false and satanicall faith for if there bee no faith in the charme it will not worke thirdly wee beleeue not the lord to be the lord of bodie and soule as one hauing soueraigne lordship and power to saue and destroy for let any ciuill man be pressed by temptation vnto sin he will bee easily brought to make no bones of very dangerous sinnes what other is the reason hereof but that hee esteemeth not the lord to be his lord and accounteth of his commandements but as dreames not serious or giuen in earnest whereas if god lordship were rightly acknowledged sinne would not be so ripe and rife as it is fourthly wee beleeue not the mercie of god in the pardon of our sinne as we ought for howsoeuer in our peace wee thinke our faith strong enough for any encounter yet let a temptatio assaile vs then we begin to doubt whether we be the children of god or no and are full of impatiencie example hereof we haue euen in iob himself who before his triall thought himselfe safe in his nest but when god hand was heauy vpon him then he brake foorth in speeches full of impatiencie as that god was his enemie and did write bitter things against him wherein he bewraied his want of faith and his crooked and cankered incredulitie and the same weakenes may the dearest amp strongest of god childre one time or other espie in themselues fiftly wee know not as we should the agonie and passion of christ he suffered the first death and the paines of the second death for our sinnes they were the speares that pearced his heart but we carrie vp our heads and can take delight in them as though there were no danger in them whereas the remembrance of them should make our hearts to bleede and faith in the heart should cause vs die to sinne seeing those who are christs are crucified with him but because man wil not depart from their sins which are not killed but liue and are strong in them and no man saith what haue i done it is a plaine euidence that the life of faith is not to be found in the liues of most man sixthly wee beleeue not that wee did rise with christ and ascended with him into heauen because in this our long peace our thoughts are set vpon the world and we mind earthly things still whereas if we were risen with christ we would seeke the things that be aboue coloss seuenthly we doe not beleeue as we ought the last iudgement because wee are not smitten with feare and reuerence in speaking and meditating of it paul speaking of it calleth it the terror of the lord corinthian and this made him so forward in al good duties yes this same consideration of the last iudgemet made him endeuour to keepe a good conscience before god and all man but man make no conscience of their waies eightly wee beleeue not aright our owne death and resurrection in the last day for man commonly deferre their repentance and amendement of life till the last day of their daies and then they crie and call on the bed of their sorrowes which argues a counterfeit faith for if a man did beleeue his death it would driue him to the daily amendement of his life by these notes we may easily discerne this secret sinne of vnbeleefe within our selues secondly when wee haue thus found out this sinne wee must bewaile it an mourne for our vnbeleefe as being the mother of all our sinnes confesse it before god and craue increase of faith as the man in the gospell lord i beleeue helpe my vnbeleefe and with the disciples lord increase our faith thirdly we must set before our eyes and acquaint our selues with the promises of the pardon of sinne and life euerlasting by christ as also all other dependant promises whereof some concerne our prosperous successe in our waies and god protection in our labours and callings and others concerne afflictions promising happie issue and deliuerance therefrom with strength in temptation to the which all promises may be referred which we must alwaies haue in our eye that our faith may ground it selfe vpon them fourthly we must truly relie and rest our selues in these promises settle and content our hearts in them that looke as the earth hangeth without proppe or pillar in the middest of the world onely by the word of god so must our hearts be staied in the same word and promise of god yes if wee should see nothing but destruction before our eies our faith must then be our subsistence and when our vnbeleefe would vnloosen our hold and make vs giue backe let our faith in these promises make resistance as dauid psalm my soule why article thou so disquieted within me trust still in god especially seeing wee haue promises which assure vs in our troubles either of their mitigation or remouall after all these followeth the subiection of faith when the heart and life are conformed to the obedience of all the commandements of god and thus we purging our harts of vnbeleefe shall escape such fearefull iudgements as this first example hath put vs in minde of these words comprehend the second example whereby the first part of the former reason is confirmed namely that whosoeuer giue themselues libertie to sinne shall be destroyed here prooued by this example of the angels themselues in which consider three points first the persons that sinned the angels secondly the sinne or fall of the angels which kept not their first estate but left their owne habitation thirdly their punishment he hath reserued in euerlasting chaines in the persons sinning wee haue sundrie considerations as first that it pleaseth the spirit of god to chuse this example of the angels to prooue his purpose and that most fitly because they are the excellencie of all creatures for so the scriptures euery where speake of them as when the highest praise that belongeth to inferiour creatures is attributed vnto them in scripture the speech is drawne from the glorie of angels gen iacob commending the fauourable countenance of isaiah being reconciled vnto him saith he saw his face as the face of an angell so manna is called angels foode that is a most excellent foode that if those excellent creatures should neede foode they could wish no better corinthian though i should speake with the tongue of man and angels signifying that if angels had tongues they must needs bee most admirable diuine and excellent dauid speaking of the glorie that man once had and in admiration of it being not able to containe himselfe breaketh out into a speech full of passion o lord what is man that thou article so mindfull of him i thou hast made him little inferiour to the angels shewing that the chiefe glorie of man in their best estate is inferiour to the excellent condition of angels yes further it is a part of the glorie of god to be attended of them and a part of our glorie after the resurrection to be like them whence note the scope of the apostle which is hence to teach vs that no glorie beautie or excellencie of the creature can exempt it from the punishment of sin when it falleth thereinto nay the more glorious the sinfull creature is the more grieuous punishment may it expect if sinne be found therein as the angels here which may instruct those who are in these schooles of the prophets in which many man excell in rare gifts of whom in regard of their wisedome and knowledge may bee said as the woman of tekoah said of dauid sam my lord is as an angell of god to heare good and bad and they are the angels of the lord of hostes malac yet for all this let them not be puffed vp hereby but walke in feare and trembling not emboldening themselues to sinne for bee it they were as the angels in gifts yet if they sinne they shall be as angels in punishment also secondly hence note that angels are substances though inuisible hauing being life sense and vnderstanding and are not onely qualities for pure qualities neither can sin nor be capable of punishment as the angels are here said to be ob it will be said seeing they are capable of punishment they must be bodily substances ans no it is sufficient they be substances to be capable of punishment though spirituall for the punishment of hell is spirituall where wee see the sadduces and others euen of our daies are deceiued who thinke angels to be nothing but motions and melancholy passions and the libertines also who thinke they are nothing but good and bad successe thirdly the name angell is not a name of nature but of office which signifieth that their office was to be the messengers of god who were to stand round about him as attendants readie to be sent foorth at his pleasure for the execution of his will in all the parts of the world in which function of theirs they are propounded patternes to vs and examples for our imitation who ought accordingly to set our selues euer in the presence of god as prest and readie to performe his will for so wee pray daily let thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen that is giue vs grace with cheerefulnes and readines to performe thy will here on earth as the angels in heauen do for whosoeuer would be like the angels in heauen must be herein like them first in earth now in that this name is here giuen to the diuels and wicked spirits it sheweth two things first what their office was in the creation vnto which they were fitted and deputed secondly the iustice of their punishment for the neglect of the execution of the same fourthly obserue the distinction of angels of which some kept their first estate others of which hee here speaketh left their first condition some stoode and some fell the ground of which distinction paul mentioneth tim i charge thee before god and his elect angels some therefore are elected and because election presupposeth a refusall others are reiected no other cause of this distinction is known to man but the will of god and his good pleasure ob if any man say it was because god foresaw that some would fall and others would stand i answere that is no cause for god did not onely foresee the fall of some but decreed also before all worlds to confirme some in their state and to passe by others in his iustice so as the cause shall euer rest in his good will which willing the same maketh it most iust not giuing vs any leaue otherwise to dispute of this doctrine or curiously to search out the secrets of it but rather to stand in admiration and say with paul o the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of god how vnsearchable are his iudgements and his waies past finding out now followeth the second point namely the fall of the angels in which obserue three points first the cause secondly the parts thirdly the measure of the fall the cause of their fal in these words which kept not their first estate but left their habitation themselues were the cause of their own fall which is thus prooued either god must be the cause of their sin or man or themselues but neither god nor man and therefore themselues first god cannot be the cause for that were iniustice to condemne them for that which himselfe caused how vnrighteous were it first to cause them to fall and then to punish them for falling obiect but it will be said that god did foresee their fall and might haue preuented it and so not hindring it hee seemeth to bee a cause of it ans whosoeuer foreseeth an euill and hindreth it not when hee may is accessarie vnto it so be he be bound to hinder it but god was not bound to hinder it being a most absolute lord not bound to any of his creatures further than he bindeth himselfe ob but god did not confirme them in that grace which he gaue them whereupon they fell whereas if he had confirmed them they had stood whence carnall reason concludeth god to bee the cause of the fall answer god gaue them grace in creating them righteous but confirmed them not therein he gaue them a power to will to perseuere but gaue them not the will not perseuerance it selfe and yet he is not to bee blamed because he would not doe it quest why would hee not ans i answere with the apostle what article thou o man that disputest with god let vs without further reasoning stay our selues in these two conclusions first that god is an absolute lord neither bound to any action neither to giue reason of any secondly that hee doth all to the glorie of his name in the manifestation of his mercie and iustice secondly as god is no cause or author of this fall of angels no more is man for the angels fell first and were the cause of mans fall and therefore themselues were the proper cause of their owne fall qu how can this be ans the angels had in themselues the proper cause and beginning of their own fall and that was a free amp flexible will whereby for the present they willed that which was good and might will to perseuere in it but that will being mutable they might also will euill and so fall from god this being the same will that adam had in the state of innocencie obiect good trees cannot bring foorth euill fruite therefore the angels being good could not sinne of themselues answer a good tree remaining good bringeth foorth good fruite but being changeable may bring forth euill so much of the cause of the fall of angels the second thing in their fall is the parts of it which here are two first they kept not their first beginning secondly they left their owne habitation first they fell from their first estate which words are expounded ioh they stood not in the truth by this truth is meant the image of god in righteousnes and true holines ephesians and this image is truly called truth because it neuer deceiueth man as vnrighteousnes doth which maketh a glorious shew of pleasure or profit but indeede it deceiueth man who finde nothing lesse therein secondly because herein is no hypocrisie it maketh no shew or appearance of other than indeed it is as the manner of falsehood is the sense then is that the angels voluntarily departed from their originall condition and stood not in that image of god wherein they were created the second part of this one sinne is that they left their habitation which a man might esteeme but a small matter but yet the sinne is not small for god in the beginning appointed most excellent places for his seuerall creatures wherein they were to performe their seruice and homage vnto god as heauen was the proper place assigned to angels to man paradise in his innocencie as after his fall the families of the patriarches before and in christs time the temple since that time the societies and congregations of the faithfull are these places appointed for man to set the speciall praises of the creator in now the angels leauing their place incurred two grieuous sinne first they left the presence of god secondly their office and calling in which they ought for euer to haue been employed in the glorifying of god ob but doe not the diuel keepe in the ayre ans some of them doe by god permission but not as in their proper place or first habitation for that was in the comfortable presence of god in heauen the third point in this sinne is the measure of it they left that is wholly and to ally their condition they quite forsooke god his image heauen it selfe and that office which therein they were assigned vnto obiect here it may bee obiected if the angels in their innocencie and excellencie f ll wholy and vtterly from god much more sinfull man although beleeuers wholy fall from god and vtterly cut themselues by from christ ans but hereunto i answere that there is not the same reason of the grace of creation as i of the grace of regeneration for that commeth farre short of this by the former the creature hath a power either to stand or fall to abide with god or depart from him and this power is in it selfe but by this latter grace of regeneration such feare of god is put into the hearts of the regenerate that they shall not depart from god iere and this power of not falling is in them indeed but not from themselues neither is it strange that there should bee such difference betweene the state of nature and that which is aboue nature againe as the grace of creation and regeneration is different so there is a difference of the will created and regenerate created will hath a freedome to will that which is good so hath the will regenerate also secondly created will hath a power to will to perseuere in that which is good so also hath the will regenerate the created will hath not the will it selfe neither the act of perseuerance wherein it differeth from the will regenerate which hath both these heere the schoolemen deceiued themselues and others in that they taught that in the conuersion of a sinner the will hath a freedome to receiue grace or not to receiue it so placing it in the will of man and putting it in his own hand and power to beleeue or not beleeue but the truth is that in the first conuersion of a sinner the will rebelleth and for none commeth to the son vnlesse the father draw him it is not the will it selfe but the conuersion of it that frame i willingnes making it of vnwilling willing to tertaine that which i truly good i is vntrue that the will of man is now as the will of angels was before their fall hauing a power to fall or not fall vse first in th the angels were condemned for forsaking their first beginning we must bewaile this sin in our selues for we also had the same first beginning with them the same image of god vpon which wee haue willingly departed that remaineth for vs to doe which belongeth not them to vs all meanes to obtaine ou first beginnings againe that this image may be restored vnto vs and renued vpon vs vnto which three things are required first that our spirituall vnderstanding be cleered and enlightened secondly that a good heart and conscience bee gotten and preserued thirdly a subiection in our whole conuersation vnto all the lawes and commandements of god secondly though we haue the same beginning by creation which is lost by our fall yet wee haue another beginning by a new birth and regeneration which they want we haue been borne baptized and brought vp many yeeres in the true faith and profession of christ now our dutie is to bee more wise than before to be warie lest wee fall from this beginning as wee haue done from the former but cleaue to our faith and stand to our vow made in our baptisme for otherwise our estate becommeth as remedilesse as the condition of the angels themselues who are shut vp in the chaines of condemnation for euer thirdly we see how farre the scriptures may bee said to bee sufficient to cleere all doubtes and determine all controuersies seeing here it onely propoundeth a generall sinne of angels and nameth no particular as peter also saith they sinned and john that they stood not in the truth thus contenting it selfe with generall tearmes without particularizing the proper sinne deseruing this iudgement and determineth not that great question controuerted among diuines of whome some say it was a in thought other that it was actuall others that it was envy some pride ampc which maketh the papists saye that the scriptures are not sufficient to determine all hard questions but we must not imagine the scriptures to be such a iudge decideth all doubts which the curiositie of mans braine may cast within it selfe whereof there are among the ancient schoolemen such as this i by scripture indeterminable nay of purpose the holy ghost u teth all cause of such curiositie by silence in such nnecessarie matters that the rather to re ne ssarie yet is the scripture a iudge sufficie tly able to resol e thy spirituall minded man in any case concerning conscience or in any matter concerning saluation all which it is the sole and proper determiner of now as for the particular sin of angels it is not necessarie to saluation to know it but seeing the scripture concealeth it it is a safe and learned ignorance to be rested in without further desire to know that which the lord hath hid in secret with himselfe fourthly wee are hence taught to seeke to enter into our habitation and true resting place which is not the earthly paradise for that was our dwelling place before the fall but heauen it selfe which since the fall is assigned and prepared to be a rest for the people of god this was the citie which abraham looked for heb so the saints departed are said to be at home with the lord being in heauen christ telles his disciples he goeth to prepare them these dwellings in heauen ioh which elsewhere he calleth euerlasting habitations make you friends of vnrighteous ma man ampc now for our better practise hereof this must be marked that howsoeuer this our habitation be in heauen yet the suburbes and the gate of it is here in earth for all the assemblies of the people of god are the and gates of heauen it selfe ye the ery entry into it iacob when he saw the testimonies and tokens of god presence and fauour built a altar in the place for his worship and called it b thel and said it was the very gate of heauen gen and therefore we must while we li e here seeke to enter if we would be ad i ted within that glorie hereafter qu but what may wee vse to help vs forward herein ans these fiue first wee must alwaies endeuour to be found readie to enter into that heauenly habitation for which purpose our hate must be at this our ho e y our whole conuersation must be in heauen w lest our are vpon earth our walking must bee in the path of life euerlasting ll containing ourselues in the waies of repentance obedience and daily mortification whereby wee denie our selues take vp our crosse and follow christ secondly loue assemblie of god people and oy e our selues vnto th i th holy vse of the word and sacraments whereby wee draw neere vnto heauen it selfe yes and keepe at the gates of this citie and with dauid thinke it a speciall priuiledge to be a doore keeper in the house of god psalm moses chose rather to suffer with the people of god great affliction than to enioy the treasures and honors of pharaohs court yes euen wicked cain himselfe thought of this as the greatest part of his punishment and which he most complained of that hee was cast out from the face of god that is out of adams familie where god face was to be seene in his worship thirdly we must weine our affections from our earthly inheritances which are but tents that they may be fixed vpon this sure habitation in heauen without the assurance of which all earthly reuenews and treasures can adde but little comfort to the heart cain built a citie hee had besides great lands and faire possessions but yet euen then the holy ghost brands him with the name of a vagabond because he was cut off from god people and cared not to ioyne himselfe vnto them againe by repentance fourthly we must euery day addresse and prepare our selues to our death seeing our death is a meanes to bring vs home to this habitation euery new day must occasion vs to renew this our preparation and this will cause vs neither to feare our owne nor excessiuely to sorrow at the departure of our faithfull friendes seeing they haue passed these first things and are onely gone before to their longed for habitation fiftly if god call vs hereunto wee must bee contented to leaue and forsake goods friends natiue country and all for assurance of inheritance in this our country and if we cannot finde the doores hereof in our owne country wee must seeke them elsewhere where we may enioy them making light reckoning of all things for this one thing of highest account the last vse of this doctrine is to teach vs from this sinne of the angels our contrarie dutie they by their office were to doe homage vnto god and performe all dutie as children to their father for so iob calleth them the sonnes of god but this office they departed from we now being by adoption the sonnes and daughters of god being called vnto holinesse are to take heede of this sinne of forsaking our calling yes on the contrarie to walke worthie thereof as the sonnes of god approouing our faithfulnes vnto him and it standeth vs in hand so to do seeing the contrarie hath such iust vengeance attending vpon it as now in this example we are in the next place to behold the third point in this example is the punishment of the angels which hath two degrees first their custodie in these words he hath reserued them namely in durance secondly their full punishment vnto the iudgement of the great day the former is set foorth in two things first in that they are reserued in chaines secondly vnder darkenes by these chaines are signified first that mightie power of god which bridleth and restraineth the might and malice of the diuels themselues as reu the old dragon was bound for a thousand yeeres the power of god was the chaine that curbed and ouermastred him and this is one part of his present punishment secondly the chaines signifie also that guiltines of the angels which by the tenour of god iustice bindeth them ouer to destruction these bonds be vpon the consciences of the wicked angels they know they are adiudged to damnation for their sinne so a let them be where they will in the earth or ayre or wheresoeuer these chaines of guiltie consciences binde them ouer to iudgement where we are taught two things first to beware of guiltie and accusing consciences for these are god chaines binding bodie and soule vnto euerlasting vengeance and therefore for time past if thy conscience accuse thee seek in due time to be loosed and freed by christ that thou maist be able to say with paul i knowe nothing by my selfe and for time to come beware of sinne euen small sinnes as well as great for so many sinnes as thou committest are so many chaines binding thee ouer to iust damnation secondly hence wee also learne that the seruice of god is a most happie and sweete libertie any libertie else is straite bondage man thinke that to be tied to the daily seruice of god is a yoke and bondage intolerable and they must need haue libertie to sinne but they deceiue themselues for while they seeke for libertie by this meanes they plunge themselues into captiuitie and lay chaines vpon themselues yes bolts which hold them in eternall bondage the libertie which is sweet vnto those who are freed by christ is that they can walke before god in the compasse of their callings without those accusing consciences which continually vexe and torment the wicked man and angels themselues further these chaines are called here eternall because the wicked angels stand guiltie for euer without hope of recouerie or redemption seeing christ tooke not vpon him the seede and nature of angels to redeeme them but abrahams seede where note god infinite mercie to mankinde who being fallen haue found a meane of redemption published in the ministrie of the word whereby god people being bound before are loosed from their chaines but the angels those glorious creatures being fallen found no sauiour nor any meanes giuen by god to loose them for their chaines are eternall which infinit mercie towards vs should stirre vp our dead hearts to thankfulnes and continuall praise of god free mercie who hath giuen vs the blood of his son to loose these chaines when wee as little deserued it as the angels vnto whom such fauour was denied the second part of their custodie is that they are kept vnder darknes which darkenes signifieth the wrath and anger of god and want of the blessed fauour which dauid prayed for and calleth it by the contrarie name the light of his countenance psalm and as these angels are said to be in darknes so the saints are saide to bee in light column that is in god fauour ob but the wicked angels are not wholy cast out of god fauour for they haue faith and therefore some fauour and grace of god ans the diuels indeede beleeue but they haue not their faith by the gift of illumination as man haue but it riseth of the remnant of naturall light and vnderstanding left in them since their fall whereby they can perswade themselues of the truth of the word of god so their faith is not from any grace since their fall neither common nor speciall besides this reserued light lighteneth not nor easeth but increaseth their torment vse seeing the miserie of the angels is to be kept vnder darknes which is to bee cast out of god fauour wee learne to place all our happines in the fruition and enioying of this fauour of god and instantly to pray that the lord would still lift vp the light of his countenance vpon vs in that our whole felicitie must be placed in the apprehension of god mercie in the pardon of sinne and life euerlasting the second degree of their punishment is that they are reserued vnto the iudgement of the great day wherein the fulnes and extremitie of their torment is expressed for by iudgement is meant that fearefull and finall condemnation and torment which they are adiudged vnto which abideth them and is reserued for them where we see that howsoeuer the diuels are alreadie entred into diverse degrees of their punishment yet their full punishment and the full wrath of god is not powred vpon them till the last iudgement this themselues know as matth article thou c me to torment vs before the time that time is called here the great day because the greatest workes of god shall be accomplished in that day for first an assemblie of all man and angels shall be made by the sound of a trumpet who shall all be cited before god iudgement seate though they were resolued into dust many thousand yeeres before secondly all the workes and intentions of man good or bad shall be in that day reueiled eccl thirdly another great worke is the giuing of a most vpright sentence vpon all man of absolution vnto the godly and of condemnation vpon the wicked angels and man fourthly the reward shal be giuen to euery man according to his worke to the godly free reward of life and glorie to the wicked deserued condemnation fiftly then shall christ god and man giue vp his kingdome vnto his father and shall cease to raigne not as god for he shall bee still equall o his father but as mediatour for an end shall be put to all families societies ciuill and ecclesiasticall distinctions and gouernments so as in regard of ou ward gouernment and administration this his kingdome shall cease vse let the remembrance of this great day strike vs with feare and reuerence of it shall euery worke bee brought vnto iudgement then let vs feare god and keepe his commandements it is the vse that salomon maketh ecclesiastes and considering those terror of the lord what manner of man ought wee to bee in all holy conuersation saith the lord yes the diuels themselues beleeue and tremble in remembrance of this terrible and great day but how many atheists be there worse than the diuels themselues that make a mocke of these great workes not fearing nor acknowledging the scriptures heauen hell god diuell nor this great iudgement day but experience shall teach such fooles who in the meane time might learne so much of the diuell himselfe but that god hath giuen them into his hand to bee led by his will to tremble at the remembrance of this dreadfull day and let all that loue the lord shake off securitie and stand in awe and feare with another feare let their hearts bee smitten with a reuerent feare that this day ouertake them not vnawares in this verse is laid downe the third and last example proouing the first part of the former reason and it is the first part of a similitude the words euen as signifying that the holy ghost here instituteth a comparison the former part or proposition whereof is in this verse and the reddition or second part in the two next following in the example consider three things first the people who were destroyed secondly the sin for which they were destroyed thirdly the destruction or punishment it selfe first the people destroyed were sodome and gomorrha and the rest of the cities about them which cities are named deut admah and z b im the reason of whose destruction is noted by the apostle because they followed the sinnes of sodome and gomorrha they sinned in like manner so as they being found in the same sinnes they were wrapped vp in y e same iudgements here first marke that the holie ghost mentioneth not the persons who were destroyed but their cities to signifie an vniuersal destructio an vtter ruine and a total ouerthrow of the the which heaping vp of so many words expressing the same thing giueth vs likewise to vnderstand that place in pet he turned their cities into ashes condemned them and ouerthrew them whence we may note that there is a difference betweene the people of god amp those who will not be obedient to his word these meet with vtter destruction god people may be destroyed indeed but not vtterly for we must alwaies beleeue the catholike church vpon earth elijah in his time could not behold it but yet there were reserued from that general apostasie of those daies when the lord visiteth his owne house in iudgement his manner is to leaue some remnants whom he saueth lest their destruction should be like this of sodome and gomorrha so isaiah acknowledgeth except the lord of hostes had reserued vnto vs euen a small remnant wee had been like to sodome and the people of gomorrha vse this may teach vs true humility in regard of our own deseruings and true thankfulnes in regard of god gratious dealing with vs both of which must be often acknowleged of euery member of the church and euery man must confesse and say with the church lam it is the lord mercies that wee are not vtterly consumed secondly in these people obserue the iustice of god and his seuerity in such an vniuersall destruction sparing none but destroying euen the children with the parents who sinned not in following strange flesh as their fathers did which maketh this a strange and vnsearchable iudgement whence the atheists condemne these bookes of moses whence this iudgement is fetched as attributing to god crueltie and iustifying in him iniustice but herein to cleere the iust proceeding of the most righteous god we are to know first that the childe is god creature and the life of it is god hee being the lorde of life so as hee may take it away when he pleaseth hauing power to doe with his owne as hee will secondly children are part of the parents and therefore the lorde may iustly infold them in the punishment of their fathers sinne to manifest his greater detestation of it thirdly children are borne in originall sinne and therefore god may iustly inroll them with their parents not onely in temporall punishments but in euerlasting condemnation also thirdly in this people who are made examples note that as wicked a people as these haue had mercie offered them isai the prophet calles the iewes princes the princes of sodome and their people the people of gomorrha that is such princes and people as matched sodome and gomorrha themselues in wickednes and yet hee inuiteth them vnto repent nce with proffer of mercie and promise of pardon yes though their sins were as red as scarlet he would then make them white as snow verse whence we may learne that the mercie of god euery way matcheth his iustice in iustice he ouerthroweth sodome and gomorrha and in mercie saueth those who were euery whit as wicked as they his free grace bringeth those to heauen who by their sinne equalled themselues to those whom his iustice had detruded into hell yes it offereth and giueth repentance to them which are holden in the snare of the diuell and ruled at his will tim manasseh himselfe who broke off his couenant with god by making league with the diuell found mercie with god vpon his repentance vse let not the greatnes of our sinnes dismay vs from seeking the lord thy sinnes are not aboue the sinnes of sodome and gomorrha for which mercie hath been obtained vse thou also meanes to turne vnto god and there is mercie in store but see thou abuse not this mercie vnto sinne fourthly note that in the same time this people of sodome and gomorrha was destroyed lot escaped though he was in sodom for at the time of the execution the angell led him out from among them and not before which teacheth that although the lord seeme sometime to neglect his deare servant and leaue them in tribulation yet the instant time of their necessitie sheweth his gratious and seasonable regard and remembrance of them the israelites had a promise that after foure hundred and thirtie yeeres they should be deliuered from their bondage in egypt which promise the lord was not vnmindfull of neither for the substance nor circumstance of time for in the very same night that the time was expired their deliuerance was wrought according to the promise our dutie hence is to learne in the middest of our afflictions with quiet hearts to rest and relie our selues vpon god waiting his time wherein hee will come in mercie vnto vs fifthly note that with this people of sodom and gomorrha the other cities admah and zeboim because they followed their sinnes were likewise destroyed where we learne to auoide the wicked manners and fashions of the world not imitating these less cities which imitated the greater in their wicked manners but on the contrarie follow the example of dauid in shedding river of teares when hee beheld man not keeping the lawes of god wee should not with drie eyes behold mens impieties ye for this end our hearts should be like vnto lots when wee see the sinnes of our people breake out as the sinnes of sodom and gomorrha our righteous hearts should be vexed within vs in the daily seeing and aring of such vncleannes so much of the people punished now followeth the second point in the example namely the sinnes for which sodom and gomorrha were destroyed in these words they committed fornication and followed strange flesh first they committed fornication secondly they committed sinnes against nature it selfe following strange flesh to vnderstand the vilenes of these sinnes consider two things first the cause and occasion of them and that was abundance of prosperitie and plentifulnes of god blessings for sodom was as a garden of god enriched with varietie of profit and pleasures this caused lot to chuse sodom to dwell in this ground nourished foure bitter rootes from which these sinnes of fornication and following strange flesh did spring reckoned vp by ezechiel chap the sins of thy sister sodom were first pride by reason of prosperitie secondly fulnes of bread that is they gaue themselues to eating and drink excessiuely for so saith luke thirdly idlenes which was the daughter of their securitie fourthly vnmercifulnes and contempt of the poore and these must needs nourish all sinnes of vncleannes vnto which adde a fifth sinne mentioned gen and that is contempt of heauenlie admonition and instruction for they scorned lot while hee warned them of their danger the second thing in their sinne is the measure of it they sinned in like manner ampc the originall signifieth and implieth not onely a bare committing of sin but a giuing of themselues ouer to commit their filthie lusts and that impudently and shamelesly which the prophet esay noted also chap they declare their sins at sodom they hide them not shewing that they were past all shame in these most shamefull sinnes yes they boasted and gloried in them both which may be gathered in genesis and doctr by these sins we are taught to take a view of the sinnes of these last times vnto which that of ezechiel vnto ierusalem may bee properly applied thou hast iustified thy sisters namely samaria and sodom in all their abominations so these last times iustifie sodome in her abominations which i prooue thus first the church of rome is that sodome wherein the two prophets were slaine revelation it is there so called because it matcheth sodom in her sinnes in that it teacheth the sins of sodom in making lawes to inhibite lawful mariage in sundry sorts of man to tole ate fornication and such filthinesse yes not onely by the scriptures but in many other sundrie ancient and some of their owne recordes it is manifest that rome is a sodome whence wee see not onely the dutie of euery lot and righteous person namely to hasten out of her but also the end and destruction that abideth her to be euerlasting secondly againe in these times i must bee verified and is also which was applied by christ vnto them of his age luke it is in these latter times as it was in the daies of lot man eate and drinke buy and sell marrie and giue in marriage and thinke of nothing and the wonderfull of many that many in the midst of the church herein may match if not exceede euen sodom amp gomorrha themselues thirdly whoso uer saith christ shall not beleeue and obey the doctrine of the gospell it shall be easier for sodome and gomorrha in the day of iudgement than for them which sentence might moue most man to tremble who whilest they take themselues freed from sodomes sins fornication and following strange flesh they nourish a sinne within them which maketh them as farre off their saluation as sodom it selfe is and that is the not receiuing of the gospell as they ought most man content themselues to liue ciuilly and out of danger of humane lawes but as for the doctrine of religion and yet much more the power and life of it it lieth horribly neglected but sodom it selfe shall bee saued before such man doct in that fornication and following strange flesh are the sinnes of sodom wee are taught to auoide this sinne of fornication and al sinnes of vncleannes for first the heauie curse of god is passed not only against sodom and gomorrha for th se sinnes but wh esoeuer they be found they be sins that burne to destruction iob they set families on fire and deuoure them vtterly waste and consume them againe no fornicators adulterers wantons b gga ers shall euen be admitted into the kingdome of heauen and in verse the same apostle propoundeth sixe reasons why we should flie fornication first our body are the lord and must be seruiceable vnto him secondly wee looke they should be raised to glorie in the last day and therefore wee must in the meane time keepe them honorable thirdly they are the mebers of christ we may not th n make them the member of an fourthly whereas all other sinnes are without the body this directly is against the body fifthly the body is the of the holy ghost and th se sinnes make it the diuels and sixthly our body are bought with a price and it is sacriledge glorifie god in the body as well soule both are alike his now if any man solicited by temptation vnto and would know how might ouermaster them hee must begin with his heart and obteine and reteine within it the feare of god which onely is able to ouerrule him this grace alone preserued ioseph being daily inticed by po iphars wife how should i doe this wickednes and sin against god gen the third point in this example is the punishment it selfe in which three things may bee noted first the matter of it they suffered the punishment of eternall fire by fire we must not vnderstand our fire no such materiall and bodily fire as ours is but an eternall fire that is the endlesse and comfortlesse apprehension of god wrath for sinne eternally burning that is alwaies terribly tormenting the sinner called fire because as burning of fire is the most horrible and sensible torment vnto nature so much more terrible is this torment which elsewhere is called by other names as the worme that neuer dieth ampc where in the fearefulnes of the punishment marke the grieuousnes of this sinne it were therefore to bee wished that whoredome might bee punished with death the theefe doth not more if so much harme against families and common wealths as sinners of this kinde and qualitie the second thing is the of their punishment when they gaue themselues wholie to fornication amp were come to the height in their sins where note that though the lord be slow to wrath yet hee recompenseth that slownes with the heauines of it when hee commeth seeing he commeth not till he must needs and that is not till sin bee at the height and most of necessitie bee taken downe as appeareth in those foure hundred yeres allotted for the filling vp of the amorites sinnes let vs then beware of abusing god patience by adding to our sinnes for then he is adding vnto and heaping his iudgements and wee shall finde that though he come slowly yet he will strike surely if we giue not a stroke to our sinnes by repentance as in his iudgements may bee preuerned the third thing noted here is the vse of this punishment namely they an example to the whole world which that so all of the son for god teacheth not nely by his word of it but really also by his workes in the execution of his iudgements iob saith that god speaketh to man once or twice therein teaching that corrections are the speeches of god in mens so as no person or people can go cleere away with that plea that they wanted all meanes of instruction seeing the whole earth is filled with the iudgements of god now the apostle commeth to the proofe of the second part of the former reason namely that these seducers are they which take libertie to and therefore they shall be destroyed this is prooued in this and some verses following by a particular rehearsall of certaine sinnes apparant in these man in this verse three things are offered to be considered of vs first the downe of two vices vnto which these man were addicted first they flesh secondly they despise gouernment secondly the fountaine of these and other their sins in this word thirdly the manner of their sinnes in these two words likewise notwithstanding namely in two things first as sodome and gomorrha sinned so ned these likewise no otherwise than they secondly they did not only sinne as they of sodome did but notwithstanding they knew what had befallen sodom and gomorrha they not being afraide of these iudgements rush into these sinnes and hereby they are conuinced to bee dreamers seeing they sleepe securely in the middest of such iudgements in handling the words wee will first speak of the fountain because it is first in nature and then secondly of their sinnes flowing from thence the origin ll of these sinnes is that they are dreamers which worde leadeth vs to a double cause of them first that they are sleepers made with sleepe and secondly in this sleepe of theirs they are deluded with dreames we are then to vnderstand first what th sleepe is and in the next p ce what bee the dreame which in sleepe them this sleepe is not that naturall sleepe which oppresseth the bodie but a spirituall sleepe like vnto that in diverse things going ouer the soule binding vp the faculties of the same and bringing a heauines or deadnes rather into all the powers of man so far forth as they ought to be mouing in spiritual actions and affaires it causeth the mind neuer to thinke seriously of god or a mans owne estate the conscience neuer or seldom to accuse for sinne committed the will neuer or seldome to will that which is truly good the affections neuer or seldome to be mooued at god word or workes thus it goeth ouer the whole soule and casteth it in a dead sleepe so as it is altogether vnfit to goe about the actions of an heauenly life example hereof we haue in the old world they eat and dranke ampc and knew nothing till the flood came they dreamed continually of many other things but neuer of their owne destruction diues also was cast on such a sleepe he f red deliciously euery day hee neuer thought of heauen for he was neuer to come there nor of hell fire till he felt the flame this spirituall sleep is three fold first the naturall sleepe of heart by which euery one is ouertaken so as by nature no man can so much as moue himselfe to the least good till god awake him and say to him awake thou that sleepest and stand vp from the dead the second sleepe is a slumber and indeed the remainders of this naturall sleepe in the children of god being awakened out of their dead sleepe for euen they are ouertaken often with a spirituall slumber by reason of remainders of sin in them so the spouse acknowledgeth cant i sleep but my heart waketh the third sleepe is the increase of that naturall sleepe and deadnes of heart by the custome of sinne when as the heart is made past feeling and altogether senselesse through continuance in sinne ephesian this last kind is that which is attributed here to these deceiuers for so the word notwithstanding importeth for although they knew the iudgements of god against sinne yet they are senselesse and carelesse in the middest of them now in the next place let vs see what these dreames are here spoken of and they bee nothing else but wicked carnall and vaine imaginations arising from an impure heart and conceiued in a corrupted mind which in the end deceiue and delude man no otherwise than a dreame which while a man sleepeth seemeth to haue some truth in it but as soone as one awaketh it vanisheth away and indeed hath in it nothing lesse an example whereof wee haue in the rich man luke who in his fulnes and encrease of riches dreamed of an happinesse and a continuance in it many yeeres when that night his soule was taken away the angell of the church of laodices dreamed that hee was rich encreased with wealth and stood in need of nothing whereas hee knew not that hee was blinde poore miserable and naked reue so the pharisee dreamed that he was another manner of man than the poore sinfull publicane but it was but a meere dreame for the other departed away iustified doct hence we may note the cause why so few entertaine the doctrine of the gospell so few forsake their sinnes and turne vnto god and that is because man are dreamers being cast and lulled asleepe in their sinnes and therein deluded with many false imaginations which draw them from god as first some pleade that they were neuer booke learned they could neuer write nor reade therefore they must be excused in their ignorance as not being bound to know the word of god they need not frequent so many sermons or if they doe they are not greatly to care to carrie them away secondly others dreame that because they haue liued thus long and yet had neuer any such crosse as they see befall others therfore they are most happie man and god loueth them they finde the blessing of god vpon them in euery thing and therefore they serue god well enough or so much as serueth their turne thirdly others haue learning and knowledge and begin to dreame that therefore they want nothing they blesse themselues in their naked knowledge and neuer haue care in their hearts to receiue christ fourthly others are prophane and dreame that the master will not come yet god will not yet call them they shall haue time enough to repent in for they craue but one houre on their death beds and that shal they haue in the meane time they giue themselues ouer to riot and excesse neuer regarding though all the world crie shame vpon them vntill their master take them vnawares lastly it is a common dreame amongst man that the promise of life eternal is but a dreame and so many make but a dreame of the whole word of god and all religion that looke as sarah did not so much regard the promise as she ought to haue done because she tooke it for a dreame and made a matter of laughter of it gen and as those who were reduced from y e captiuity of babylon entertained the promise of their returne but as a dreame by their own confession psalm and peter whe he was deliuered by the angel out of prison could not bee perswaded that it was so but that he had seene a vision or dreamed a dreame act euen so man hold the doctrine of the gospell but as a dreame seeing they can hold it in opinion but neuer endeuour to reforme their liues by it but such dreames disappoint man commonly of saluation which while man bring to the hearing of the word it is no marueile if we haue such iust cause of complaint for want of profiting vnder it as appeareth euery where at this day the most powerfull ministrie shall little preuaile so long as man come with their hearts ful fraught with their carnall imaginations and with such heauines of spirit secondly in that these dreames are made the causes of all sinnes we are taught to learne the lesson of the apostle ephesian awake thou that sleepest and stand vp from the dead and thess let vs not sleepe as others doe which that wee may doe consider first the reasons and meanes which may bee effectuall to awaken vs and secondly the notes to know when wee are wakened for the former consider first the infinite iustice and wrath of god against the least sin which made the apostle say it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of god secondly the greatnes of our sinnes and the number which is like the sand vpon the sea shore thirdly y e vncertaintie of the day amp houre of our death which as it leaueth vs so shall the last iudgement finde vs fourthly our vow in baptisme wherein we promise to forsake the diuell and all our owne lusts fifthly christs passion and his bloodie sweate not for his owne but our sinnes which made him crie my god my god why hast thou forsaken mee sixthly that the night is past and it is n w day the sun is vp euen the sun of righteousnes is risen vpon vs and therefore we are to be raised out of our sleepe and walke as children of the light rom secondly if a man would know whether he begin to be awakened let him obserue whether his heart haue begun to moue in spirituall actions or no for that bodie is wakened out of bodily sleepe which can moue it selfe in bodily actions quest when doth the heart begin thus to mooue it selfe and how shall i know it answer when thou beginnest to turne thy eyes inwardly into thy selfe and canst finde and espie the priuie corruptions which lurke within thee secondly when thou article inwardly and heartily displeased with thy selfe and grieued for thy sins thirdly when thou canst humbly and heartily sue to god for pardon and canst hunger and thirst after christ and his merits aboue all earthly things fourthly when thou beginnest to endeuour to doe the will of god and please him in all things then assure thy selfe thou article wakened out of thy sleepe of sinne and not before thirdly if dreaming be the fountain of all sinne we must learne the contrary vertue namely that being once awakened wee striue to watch and be sober thess for the practise of which dutie these rules are to be marked first wee must daily and diligently obserue our selues our hearts and sinnes and seeing what sinnes wee are most prone vnto there must wee double our care and watchfulnes for otherwise where we are weakest satan soonest maketh a breach for there he makes his greatest assaults secondly we must daily looke for an euill day so as wee forecast euery day to endure the worst that it can bring foorth against vs and our profession out of which forecast in vaine shal any man purpose to keepe faith and a good conscience wee may not crie peace peace for then commonly sudden desolation commeth vpon vs thirdly wee must esteeme of euerie day as our last day that so wee may be did of which wee haue spoken in the seuenth verse and therefore passe this sinne ouer without further handling onely let this one thing bee here remembred that seeing it is a sinne of sodome to defile the bodie with the sinnes of the seuenth commandement our dutie is to reserue within vs that speciall care whereby our body may bee preserued in holines and honour thess this is the will of god the bodie must be giuen vp as an holy sacrifice to god else it shall not be acceptable rom wouldest thou haue thy bodie rise vp vnto glorie and fellowship with god and christ at the last day then let thy are bee to lay it downe in the grant in honour by preseruing i a pure member of christ for without holinesse no man shall euer see god that is haue fellowship with him being a most holy and cha spirit yes the contrarie things ought not to be named in the church of god ephesians the second sinne followeth in these words despise gouernment and speake in which words refuse and put away yes and so as they can put downe all lordship gouernment ciuill power and dominion secondly in their practise first in their iudge they put downe gouernment by eaching for otherwise they could not and maintaining that after man were conuerted to the faith being now become christians and beleeuers they were no longer to be vnder magistracie or authoritie but their neckes were to be eased from that yoke and this errour was dangerously sowne by the malitious m n in the primitiue church and called some trouble and labour vpon the apostles themselues in their as appeareth corinthian where the apostle answereth this case which servant themselues were hold to call in question being conuerted article thou called a servant care not for it so titus put them in remembrance that they be subiect to principality and powers so as it a lesson not well learned in those first ages of the gospell this was the iudgement and opinion of the false teachers which euen the word despise implieth amp presupposeth now whereas some might say that they must needs will they ill they be vnder authority for rulers and princes would and did keepe them vnder the apostle addeth and speake euill ampc that is although they cannot shake off gouernment so easily as they would yet they can easily manifest their malice against it in reuiling them that are in authoritie first then we are to speake of their doctrine and then of their practise in the former consider three things first what is this rule or gouernment which they despise secondly vpon what ground refuse they to be vnder authoritie thirdly vpon what ground doth iude condemne them for this refusall first to know what this authoritie is we must distinguish all gouernment into diuine and humane the apostle peter acknowledgeth this distinction pet submit your selues to euery humane ordinance diuine gouernment is the absolute power of god whereby he maketh lawes to binde the conscience and that vnder paine of life and death eternall this is the power of all the trinitie but the administration of it is giuen to the son this power is not here meant for had they denied this they could not haue carried a face or shew of christians the other which here is vnderstood is humane or ciuill rule and dominion whereby man is set ouer man which may be thus described ciuill gouernment is a state of superioritie consisting in the power of commanding and in the power of the sword for the common good of mankinde that it is a state of superioritie appeareth rom let euery soule be subiect to the higher power further i say it consisteth in a double power first of commanding that is of making edict and lawes of calling and conuenting secondly of the sword and that in foure things first in arresting secondly imprisoning thirdly putting to death fourthly making war in way of protection or otherwise this second power namely of the sword is added first to put a difference betweene the authoritie of the magistracie and ministrie which difference standeth in three things first the magistracie hath a power in it selfe whereby the ciuill magistrate may commaund in his own name the ministrie hath power onely to pronounce what god commandeth and that in his name secondly the authoritie of the ciuill magistrate is in himselfe the authoritie of the minister not in himselfe but in christ so as the ciuill magistrate may command obedience to himselfe but the minister commandeth it to god thirdly the ciuill gouernment hath an absolute power to compell and enforce the outward man but the ministrie hath power only to counsell perswade exhort secondly this power of the sword is added to distinguish it from all priuate power as in schooles families which haue a power of commanding but not of the sword lastly i adde for the common good of mankind rom the magistrate is the minister of god for thy wealth that is procuring the welfare of soule and body which standeth in two things first true religion secondly ciuill iustice both which are by magistracie maintained it may be here demanded church appeareth in that the preparation and performance of the same chronicle and here two differences in this authoritie must be marked first that ciuill doth not after the same order causes ecclesiasticall as in ciuill causes is ord th all and all likewise but in ecclesiasticall it hath power to order all but not execute them the magistrate indeed ordereth and prescribeth in all but the minister is e that executeth in ecclesiasticall causes secondly that ciuill authoritie hath power ouer all the things of man but not ouer the things of as the wo d and sacrament faith conscience the graces of god in ci ill power hath no rule ouer these concerning which christ comm nded to giue vnto god the things of god and vnto caesar caesars secondly this authoritie extendeth it selfe to all persons as well ecclesiasticall as ciuill but so as it stretcheth onely vnto the man to the bodie life and outward things but not to the soule and conscience of which god is the onely lord and gouernour asked what are the kinds of this power i answere it is of three sort first in one person man or woman which is a monarchie secondly in moe when the gouernment is in a few states and thirdly in the bodie of the people which is a popular gouernment by one of these three is euery common wealth gouerned these are the gouernment despised by these seducers the second point followeth vpon what grounds they despised gouernment ans their grounds may be knowne by the heretikes of th time the anabaptists who are giuen vp to the same and they be to these foure heads first subiection say they came in with sinne and therefore christ hauing taken away sinne hath taken away subiection also the former part they prooue out of gen man in innocencie was to rule ouer the fish of the sea the fowles of heauen ouer the beast the earth and all creeping things but not ouer man but after the fall eue is put vnder subiection to adam genes ans there bee two kindes of subiection the first seruile the second ciuill the former is the subiection of a slaue or vassall who is onely to seeke the proper good of his lord and master the latter whereby one man is subiect to another for the common good the former came in by sinne the latter was before sinne in innocencie eue was subiect to adam in innocencie thus the apostle reasoneth tim let the woman be subiect to the man for she was taken out of the man againe in innocencie it was said increase and multiplie and therefore in the light of nature is a plaine distinction betweene the father and son and an inequalitie the first place is misalleaged genes because it was spoken not of man alone but of all mankinde euen woman as well as man who haue also dominion giuen ouer the vnreasonable creatures as for the second place gen he shall rule and thou shalt be subiect it is not spoken because the ordinance of god simply considered in it selfe was not before the fall but because now the subiection was ioyned with feare griefe and sorrow which it wanted in innocencie for then it was a pleasure and this makes subiection a curse in some respect but is not so no not since the fall in it selfe considered secondly they reason thus euery beleeuer is in the kingdom of heauen euen in this life now in heauen there is no king but god and therefore no beleeuer is to bee subiect to any but god and christ ans there bee two kindes of gouernments vpon earth one is spirituall and inward this is the kingdome of heauen and of christ within man standing in peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost in regard of which regiment of christ there is no distinction of persons no difference of bond or free master servant father son but all are one in christ the other is a ciuill regiment wherein orders and distinctions of man must be maintained as some must bee princes some subiects some fathers some children some masters some servant whence it is that euery man susteines vpon him two persons and is to be considered first as a beleeuer and as a member of the kingdome of christ thus is he equall to any beleeuer and any beleeuer equall to him secondly as a member of the common wealth wherein he liueth thus he is either a superiour or inferiour their reason were somewhat if euery beleeuer were onely in the kingdome of heauen but euery of them liuing here in earth is also a member of some common wealth thirdly ciuill gouernment is full of crueltie which hauing the power of the sword destroyeth the body and soules of offenders in not giuing them time of repentance and therefore is intolerable among christians ans moses and the leuites by god commandement flew of the israelites for worshipping their golden calfe and neuer gaue them space to repent secondly the malefactor that is not moued to repentance at the sentence of present death there is little hope that euer hee would repent after if hee had longer time thirdly god wisedome and commaundement must take place of mans reason he commaundeth that the malefactor should die and thereby that the euill be taken away better it is that one should bee destroied than an vnitie better that one bee remoued than a multitude by the contagion of his example infected fourthly they plead liberty by some places and testimonies of scripture gal stand fast in the libertie wherein christ hath set you free ans the libertie which christ hath procured vs is libertie of conscience freedome from the power of sin satan death hell and condemnation and therefore spirituall but not from temporall and ciuill subiection ob rom owe nothing to any man but loue therefore not obedience ans there bee two kindes of debt first a ciuill debt occasioned by contract and bargaining between man and man the second is a debt to which we are bound by god law and couenant the place is meant of the former so far as it lies in our power but wee are bound still to obedience and subiection by the latter ob matth the kings sonnes are free from tribute and therefore from subiection ans christ speaketh that of himselfe who by his birth was heire to the crowne and kingdome of the jew and therefore by right was to pay none neither did but for auoiding of offence what is this to free other man from obedience to the magistrate obiect corinthian ye are bought with a price be ye not the servant of man ans the meaning is that servant should not subiect themselues to man as to absolute lord for wee must doe seruice one to another for god sake and not onely for god but in god ob beleeuers are gouerned by the spirit of god and so are able to gouerne themselues euery way and need not any gouernment of man ans one thing it is what wee doe another what wee ought to doe we ought indeede so to liue as not to need gouernours but we doe not yes and if beleeuers could yet were the reason naught for the church containes as well bad as good hypocrites as well as sincere christians and therefore the best churches neede magistracie for the punishment of the euill doers and the praise of them that doe well yes the church lying open to the malice of satan and the wicked standeth euer in neede of magistracie to protect it by force and war or otherwise the third generall point is vpon what ground doth the apostle here blame and condemne these seducers for despising ciuill gouernment ans the ground is because it is a solemne ordinance of god called therefore by peter a creation or creature which bindeth euery soule vnto subiection to the higher power rom and that for conscience sake which respecteth not so much the rule it selfe as god commandement subiecting not only ciuill but all ecclesiasticall persons thereunto christ himselfe taking vpon him mans nature was subiect vnto authoritie submitting himselfe vnto caiphas and pilate yes to apprehension arraignment condemnation and execution matth paul himselfe whose apostolicall authoritie and spiritual weapons were able to bring downe euerie opposition yet acknowledged that he must be iudged by caesar act ob ierem i set thee ouer nation and kingdoms to plant and pluck vp the prophets therefore and their successors are not to be subiect vnto ciuill magistracie an the prophet is set ouer nation amp kingdomes not to gouerne by the ciuil sword but the sword of the spirit in his mouth and he is to plant and plucke vp kingdomes no otherwise than by declaring that god would plant or pluck them vp ob esay kings shall come and serue the church in the new testament and therefore the church is not to be subiect vnto princes but they vnto it ans in the church are two things first the persons of man secondly the things of god now kings are subiect to the church but how not to the persons of beleeuers but to the things of god namely the word sacraments faith ampc obiect kings and magistrates are as sheepe ministers are pastors and shepheards therefore they are vnder the ministers as the flocks vnder the shepheards ans in the prophets pastors and ministers consider two things first their persons secondly their ministerie in regard of their persons all of them are subiect to their owne princes and that for conscience sake but in regard of their ministerie princes and magistrates are to bee subiect thereunto as wherein the word is taught and sacraments administred euen as a meane man being a sergeant may arrest a baron earle or duke who may not resist him because hee commeth with the princes authoritie vnto which he must yeeld himselfe though not vnto the person of the sergeant so must magistrates to the ministers comming not in their owne but in the name of god for this also must be marked that magistrates are not simply subiects to the ministerie but so farre as the word is rightly taught and sacraments du ie administred for else they haue power either to reforme or depose such ministers as shall faile in their administration for euen in this regard themselues are shepheards as isai cyrus is called a shepheard though otherwise he be a sheepe so far as he is truly taught and directed by the minister so much of the ground vse by this doctrine we may discouer the wickednes and horrible rebellion of sundrie persons in this age first of the bishop of rome that most ancient rebell who hath for many hundred yeeres taken vpon him an vsurped supremacie ouer all ciuill gouernment in the earth which is the highest rebellion which euer the world hath heard of seeing there is not a soule which must not bee subiect to the higher power ob yes but that place is meant of those that are to be subiect but the popes themselues are exempted ans but besides that the text commandeth euery soule to bee subiect it is made a note of antichrist to exalt himselfe aboue god and all that is called god that is all magistrates ob but they alleage the example of vzziah the king chronicle who taking vpon him presumptuously the office of the priest azariah the priest resisted him cast him out of the temple and deposed him from his kingdome ans azariah resisted the king not by force or violence but by word onely and admonition whereby hee caused him to depart the temple neither did he depose him from his gouernment but being by god striken suddenly with a leprosie he was by the law shut out from the company and societie of man and so disabled to gouerne although the right of it still belonged vnto him ob they alleage likewise the example of iehoiadah the high priest who deposed queene athaliah from her kingdome and set vp yong ioash to be king chronicle therefore the pope hath authoritie to depose kings and emperours answer iehoiadah the high priest was next to the king in blood chro and was one of the states of the land who deposed her not alone but by the common consent of all the states and peeres of the land as chap he indeede is chiefly named because he was the chiefe of them in blood neither did he set vp ioas but helped to maintaine his ight which was vsurped by attaliah in a word he protected the right heire but could not himselfe nor did not dispose the kingdome vnto him and of this kinde are all their allegations which yeeld no patronage at all to that vsurped papall authoritie but euen the pope himselfe ought to bee subiect to his emperour if hee would auoide his most iust title of a most vniust vsurper vse hence also may be obserued that the exemptio or immunitie of the clergie from the authoritie of the ciuill magistrate is wicked and a kinde of rebellion and this is the condition of the whole romane clergie ob they pleade that kings and princes of their bountie haue granted these priuiledges vnto them ans the law of nature acknowledgeth a ciuill subiection the law of god straitly enioyneth it and no law of any man may offer violence or derogate from either of these thirdly the pope vsurping a power to free subiects from their alleageance and their oath of obedience hath been for many hundred yeeres a most wicked instrument of rebellion as the kingdomes of europe haue had too wofull experience of if here they say the pope may dispense with the lawes of kingdomes i answere were it so that he could dispense with humane lawes of kings and princes in their country and prouinces which is grosse vsurpation yet with what face dare he challenge to dispense with the lawes of god and nature fourthly wee see hence what we are to esteeme of the romane religion namely as of a religion to bee abhorred as are these seducers themselues because it is cleane contrarie to christian religion which teacheth to feare god and honour the king but the romane religion pretendeth to each man to feare god but putteth downe the honour of the king nay he that professeth that religion must sweare the flat contrarie to the kings honour fifthly wee are hence directed what to thinke of that oath of the supremacie vnto the bishop of rome namely to be such a one as fighteth directly against the law of god and nature seeing it giueth all ecclesiasticall gouernment vnto the pope which belongeth properly to kings and princes in their seuerall dominions sixthly if euery man must be subiect to the power of the magistrate for conscience sake then all wandring beggars and rogues that passe from place to place being vnder no certaine magistracie or ministrie nor ioyning theselues to any set societie in church or common wealth are the plagues and banes of both and are to bee taken as maine enemy of this ordinance of god and seeing a most excellent law is prouided to restraine them it is the part of euery good subiect or christian to set themselues for the executing strengthening and vpholding of the same and speake euill of them which are in authoritie in these words the apostle sheweth how these false teachers pull down authoritie by their practise as in the former they did by their iudgmet for when they cannot quite put downe all authoritie and magistrates they speake euill of them and blaspheme those that exercise the same that is as the word signifieth those that are in dignities and glories for that is his meaning when hee calleth princes by the name of glories here two things are to bee considered first their sinne speake euill secondly the amplification of their sinne partly in this verse and partly in the next the sin is mentioned and condemned in exod thou shalt not speake euill of the rulers of thy people ecclesiastes curse not the king no not in thy heart for the birds of the ayre shall bewray it which sinne wee should be so farre from as that wee should not receiue any accusation against any elder vnder two or three witnesses timoth if we may not receiue slanders against rulers much lesse may we raise them vse see here as in a glasse the common sinne of these daies wherein the common practise yes and table talke of man is the censure of the doings of the magistrate and the doctrine of the minister paul when he called ananias a painted wall being reprooued answered that he knew him not to be the high priest for then he would not haue reproched him that is he acknowledged him not but knew him rather to be an vsurper which made him vse that boldnes secondly if a man may not speake euill of a ruler then much lesse may any priuate man take a sword in hand to take away the life of a prince or magistrate dauid knew that he was to succeed saul in the kingdome and that saul sought his life daily and yet his heart smote him when finding saul at aduantage that he cut off but the lap of his garment whereas he might haue as easily taken away his life the ground of his griefe was because hee was the lord annointed where take notice of the spirit that leadeth and ruleth those roman vassals who are sent out into christian lands with commission to take away the liues of the lord annointed ones who will not stoope vnto that antichristian tyranny instruments of satan they are inflamed by diabolicall furie fighting for their babylon with the weapon of most monstrous and vnnaturall crueltie thirdly we are on the contrarie taught hence to blesse our magistrates especially the lord annointed ouer vs as also other inferiour magistrates who although their persons may bee meane yet are vnder the supreame as hee vnder god is a steward and deputy for our wealth the apostle paul willeth that prayers be made for all man but especially for kings and princes and those that are vnder them in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honestie ieremy wisheth the people in captiuitie to pray for nebuchadnezzar an heathen king that vnder him they might haue peace hence is that good order commended vnto vs wherby in our publike prayers we make solemne mention of our lawful magistrates testifying both our desire of their good and our thankfulnes for their gouernment secondly the amplification of their sinne standeth partly herein that they speake euill of dignities glories maiesties that is of those whom god hath adorned with these in detracting and detaining from them their due honour it may bee here asked why doth the holie ghost call magistrates by the names of glorie and dignitie ans for two causes first because the lord hath set them in his owne roome and place and accordingly honoureth them with titles befitting the same psalm god standeth in the assemblie of god that is of magistrates called god not onely because he hath set the in his place but also because they haue receiued a particular charge and commandement and therwith a power of executing his own iudgements amongst man vpon earth as his deputies chro they execute not the iudgements of man but of the lord secondly these titles are giuen them because the lord doth vsually furnish them with worthie and peculiar gifts though not alwaies of sanctification yet of regiment and gouernment to bee answerable to their former designement as of wisedome courage zeale ampc sam when saul was made king the lord gaue him such princely gifts as it is said god gaue him another heart his heart was changed in regard of other gifts than formerly he had so when dauid was annoynted king and when samuel had powred the horne of oyle vpon his head it is said sam that the spirit of the lord came vpon him which furnished him with gifts and graces both of regeneration and regiment also in like manner the lord tooke of the spirit of moses and put it on the seuenty elders numb whereby they were furnished with gifts of gouernment and enabled to beare rule and iudge iustly as moses was such titles therefore as these are not ascribed vnto them without iust cause yes how can they be fitlier called than glories seeing there is no greater glorie in earth than to supplie god roome and to bee enabled with gifts for the sufficient discharge of it hence learne that it is lawful for princes to beare an outward pompe in diet buildings costly apparell and troopes of man for they are dignities and their dignitie being outward in regard of man they may maintaine it by outward pompe to procure more reuerence and awe of man thereunto so agrippa and bernice came with great pompe and entred into the common hall which pompe is not there discommended but rather approued as by the circumstances of the text appeareth secondly magistrates ought especially to honour god because he especially honoureth them this must they doe by discountenancing and punishing vice and by setting vp and maintaining true religion and vertue thirdly being in god place they are to execute iustice without corruption or partialitie in the face and feare of god chro seeing the iudgement is the lord let the feare of god bee vpon you take heede and doe it deut ye shall haue no respect of persons in iudgement but shall heare the small as well as the great ye shall not feare the face of man for the iudgement is god and herein stands a great part of their glorie fourthly we are in all lawful things to yeeld free subiection and obedience vnto our magistrates and gouernours euen as vnto god himselfe whose roome they are in which duty the child oweth also to his father the servant to his master because they also are set ouer them in god stead fifthly hence also is it lawful for vs to giue to princes the titles of maiestie and grace because it hath pleased the holy ghost to ascribe them vnto them and by their titles to commend their persons and places vnto vs yes and to furnish them with such gifts of magistracie as that they become not onely naked titles but iust significations of the true honour which god hath graced them withall in this verse is laid downe another reason amplifying their sin of these seducers by a comparison from the greater to the lesse and thus it standeth michael the archangell durst not so much as raile on the diuell himselfe much lesse may these vpon magistrates who are god and consequently their sinne is hainous who dare open their mouthes to reuile princes and magistrates here one question is mooued namely whence the apostle had this historie of the disputation betweene michael and the diuell concerning the bodie of moses seeing it is not to bee found in the scriptures i answere the substance of it is in the scripture although though not the circumstances for in deut is said that the lord buried moses but no man knoweth of his sepulchre till this day there is the ground of the historie the other particular concerning the contention of the archangell and the diuell wi h this manner of rebuking is not found in the old testament quest where then had he this ans either from some booke then extant among the iewes which is not now to bee found or else from some tradition which passed amog the iewes from hand to hand as many things did as that timot where the apostle saith that iannes and iambres withstood moses the historie of which is not found in the old testament hence the papists conclude that the word written is not sufficient and perfect in and of it selfe vnlesse the vnwritten word be added vnto it that is that word which is giuen by tradition both which say they make a perfect word but neither is perfect or sufficient alone grounding their opinion hence that iude alleageth an example out of a tradition which is not found in scripture but that is an hereticall doctrine and vntrue seeing the perfection of a thing is not to bee measured by euery thing that is wanting vnto it but by the perfect end of it for perfection is taken from the end whence i reason thus if the written word be perfect and sufficient to the end to which it is ordained it is euery way perfect but it is perfect and sufficient to that end namely to the glorie of god in working out perfectly the faith amp saluation of man and is in nothing wanting for the atchieuing of this end but sufficiently teacheth all things to be beleeued and done and giueth perfect direction concerning faith and manners ioh these things are written that they might beleeue and beleeuing might haue life thorough his name rom whatsoeuer things are written are written for our learning that wee through patience and comfort of the scriptures might haue hope and therefore the word written is euery way most sufficient and absolutely perfect and neede no addition or tradition to helpe forward this end ob this place is a tradition and not written and many other true traditions were neuer written besides that the church may make traditions ans we grant many true traditions are not in scripture but such they are as a man may be ignorant of and not preiudice his saluation againe the church hath a power and hath had priuiledge to make constitutions and lawes which were to be knowne and receiued but these are such as only concerne the orderly gouernment of the church and are not necessarie to saluation ob but some traditions are necessarie to saluation which are not contained in the written word and they alleage two first in rom that god word must be tried by the rule of faith and so also by the same rule expounded this rule of faith is nothing else by their exposition but a general consent in the hearts of all true catholikes together with the pope assenting with them which of necessitie wee must beleeue and yet say they it is not in the scripture and therefore some things must of necessitie bee beleeued which are not in the scripture ans the rule of faith is not such a crooked rule as they would thrust vpon the world by their wicked exposition but the right rule of faith is the plaine word of god euery way absolutely directing in all points of faith and loue tim paul wisheth timothy to keepe the true patterne of wholesome words in faith and loue which is nothing else but the testimonie of scripture in points of faith and loue comprised in the decalogue and apostles creede the rule of faith therefore in expounding scripture is scripture it selfe the second thing necessarie by their doctrine to be beleeued not contained in scripture is that the canonical scripture is god word which truth is absolutely necessarie to saluation to be beleeued but cannot otherwise bee knowne or beleeued but onely by the tradition of the church ans as euery other arte and science hath certaine principles of truth to proue all other precepts by but themselues are to bee prooued by none so also hath diuinity the chiefe of al other sciences of which kinde this is one principle that canonicall scripture is god word which not granted inferreth a destruction of all other diuine rules this is a truth therefore confirmed not a thing testified from some other but as a ground of it selfe secondly in diuine matters saith goeth before knowledge which in humane things is cleane contrarie for if a man would know whether fire bee hot let him put his hand vnto it he shall haue experience of it and then he shall beleeue it but in diuine things first a man giueth credit and yeeldeth consent to the word and then hath experimentall knowledge for although faith hath his knowledge yet experimentall knowledge followeth faith abraham beleeued aboue hope here faith went before knowledge ioh if ye do the will of my father yee shall know whether the doctrine bee of god nor no thus then we may conceiue it the tenour of the word of god is this thus saith the lord if the question now be whether the lord said thus or no i answere to beleeue the church herein before god is sacriledge but herein we are first to yeeld assent vnto god and then after this experimentall knowledge will follow that canonicall scripture is the word of god thirdly wee know that scripture is god word by scripture and not by the church out of which being in humilitie taught and acquainted with the excellent matter of it and manner of writing the end the glorie of god and our owne saluation wee cannot but haue sufficient perswasion of the author of it and that it can proceede from none other but god himselfe thus notwithstanding the allegations of the aduersaries the written word retaineth that perfection which needeth no tradition to strengthen or further it in that end to which it is appointed now to the reason it selfe amplifying this sinne in this verse which containeth three points to be considered first the person that durst not raile secondly the goodnes of his cause which was very iust and yet he durst not raile vpon the diuell himselfe thirdly the manner of his speech the lord rebuke thee the person that durst not raile was michael the archangell whom some affirme to bee christ himselfe others that he is some chiefe arch and principall angel which opinion is more probable for first the apostle speaketh of him as one in subiection and standing in awe not daring to breake the law of god for he durst not reuile the diuell secondly in thess the lord christ shall come to iudgement with the sound of a trumpet and the voyce of an archangell where is a plaine distinction betweene christ who should come in the clowdes and the archangell thirdly peter explaineth it speaking the same thing and saith the angels giue not railing iudgement against them pet it is more probable then that by michael was meant a principall angell rather than christ doctr first from the person wee learne that there be distinctions and degrees of angels there bee angels and an archangell quest is there but one archangell ans the scripture speaking of archangels vseth alwaies the singular number neuer mentioning more than one and where the scripture resolueth not we are not to determine yet i condemne not those who haue probably held that there are more than one secondly wee haue here an example of angelicall meeknes and modestie tit put them in remembrance that they bee subiect to principalitie and speake euill of no man but shew all meeknes vnto all the contrarie practise of railing slandering and obtrecting is a propertie of the diuell whence he hath his name reu the accuser of the brother and the aduersarie pet who is euer readie with one accusation or other to stand vp against euery man the malitious man whose malice caused him to stand vp against iob and falsely accuse him of hypocrisie vnto god own face let slanderers and backbiters of their brother see hence whom they imitate and most liuely resemble secondly consider the goodnesse of michaels cause which was this it was the wil of god that moses body should be buried in a secret place vnknown to any man to preuent and auoid al occasion of superstition and idolatry amog the iewes the diuell on the contrarie would discouer it that so the israelites might fall to idolatry before it herein the archangell resisted him and stroue with him for the performance of the will of god and the maintenance of his true worship and yet in this good cause michael durst not reuile the diuel himselfe in this cause consider two things first the fight and contention betweene michael and the diuell secondly the cause and occasion of it about moses bodie in the former wee may obserue that there is a sharp and serious contention betweene good and bad angels in which the good angels labour to defend all that are in christ against the rage and furie of the diuell and his angels as psalm the angels of the lord pitch their tents round about those that feare him and on the contrarie the diuell and wicked spirits cast about how to destroy the body and soules of man pet our aduersarie the diuell goeth about continually seeking whom he can deuoure this combat concerneth and is conuersant about either first the persons or secondly the societies of man the fight about the persons concerneth either infants or man of yeres first for infants the diuell seeketh how to spoyle and destroy them especially those of elect and faithfull parents in regard of their weaknes and tendernes both of minde and bodie but the angels of the lord haue charge giuen the to defend them against this malice of satan as psalm they shall beare thee vp in their armes that is they shall bee as nurces to beare them in their armes preseruing them from danger mat despise not one of these little ones for their angels alwaies behold the face of my father which is in heauen secondly concerning man of yeeres the diuell and his angels striue to driue them out of their waies and callings and to leade them into crooked paths as he would haue had christ to haue leapt fro off the top of the pinacle although he had an ordinarie way to go downe and haue made stones bread but the good angels on the other side are giuen vs to keep vs in all our waies psalm and so vnder the protection of the almightie the second strife namely about societies concerneth either first families secondly churches or thirdly common wealths all which the diuell striueth to ouerturne as the good angels to preserue and maintaine them first the diuels endeuour is vtterly to ouerthrow all families of christian man especially he robbed iob of all his substance slew his servant and children but the good angels guard and defend them iacob had the angels of god defending him and his familie from the furie of esau gen psalm when the plague and pestilence preuaileth against the vngodly the good angels keepe it off from comming neere the tabernacles of the righteous secondly in churches and congregations the wicked angels striue to corrupt the word sacraments and all the ministerie or to make it fruitlesse euery way to their power hindring the good successe thereof the diuell offereth himselfe to bee a lying spirit in the mouth of all ahabs prophets zach he standeth at iehoshuah his right hand to withstand him in his office he seweth tares in the field where the good seede of the word is sowne mat hence are those false doctrines of forbidding meates and marriages called the doctrine of diuels tim he hindred paul once or twice from his iourney to the thessal to confirme them thess he raiseth persecution against the church for hee is said to cast some of the church at smir a into prison reu the good angels on the contrarie fight against them for the good of the church the furtherance of the gospell and preseruation of the true worship of god the law was giuen by their ministrie galat the tidings of saluation and the doctrine of the gospell was first preached by angels luke the angell brought philip to instruct the eunuch act as also to baptise him verse deliuered peter out of prison act thirdly the wicked angels seeke to supplant common wealths and kingdomes satan moued dauid to number the people by which sinne he wasted of his people the good angels fight in their defence the angell told daniel that hee fought against the prince of the kingdom of persia for the iewes daniel the angell smote of zenacheribs armie in one night an hundred fourescore and fiue thousand who were enemy to the church king ob how can the diuell thus furiously fight against persons and societies seeing he was neuer seene neither can this fight be perceiued of vs ans as he is a spirit so his fight is spirituall not easily discerned by the eye of flesh for we fight not against flesh and blood but against principality and spirituall wickednesses againe he fighteth not onely in his owne person by his instruments and complices whom hee daily raiseth vp against the persons of man and all humane societies and this fight we may in part perceiue vse first note hence the dignitie of euery beleeuer who haue the angels yes and as here the archangels to put themselues in garrison for their defence for from christ it is secondly we are with all thankfulnes to acknowledge god prouidence and protectio especially in this land whose peace and prosperitie hath bin so long established vnto our persons and societies our families church and common wealth wheras if sata had might to his malice no one of these should stand a moment thirdly in all dangers our comfort must hence bee raised that though satans crueltie bee neuer so great yet we haue the guard and defence of the good angels to keep vs in al our waies and these are too many and too strong for him and all the power hee can raise against vs thus was elis s servant comforted there be more with vs than against vs the good angels are more powerfull for our good than the wicked are to harme and hurt vs fourthly nce learne to make conscience of euery sinne in thought word and deed for admitting and commi ing any sin wee trecherously turne against those that fight for our defence and do what we can to grieue and driue them away from vs and so put our selues in the power of satan to bee led at his pleasure into sinne as also into the dangers of it the second point in this cause of contention is the occasion of it namely it was about moses his bodie michael would not suffer the diuell to reueile where moses bodie was laid so to sow the seedes of idolatry whereby god true worship might be ouerturned for hee cared not for the bodie of moses but to bring in idolatry by meanes of it hence note that the wicked angels fight not so much against the body of m as against their soules nor contend so much to ouerthrow them in their outward es ate or to depriue them of their goods drink ampc as in their inward to est from them their spirituall things namely god true worship and the things and meanes which to the maintaining and we haue to fight in high places ephesian but may as well in spirituall things for therein bend they their principall forces the of the diuell is to blinde the mindes of infidel that the light of the glorious gospell of christ should not shine vnto them corinthian this same serpent that be guiled eue thorough his subtiltie seeketh how to corrupt mens minde from that simplicitie which is in christ corinthian vse first we must keepe that which is committed vnto vs tim the treasure which god hath put into our hands is his true worship sound doctrine right vse of sacraments al which seeing satan most desireth to breake off or corrupt wee ought accordingly to striue how wee may preserue them to our selues and haue them continued in their puritie to our posteritie secondly in that satan seeketh to depriue the soule of spiritual things we must our graces and become more vigilant in maintaining and adding also vnto our knowledge faith loue hope and other our graces seeing satan will si t v to make vs chaffe we must watch and pray that our faith faile not thirdly marke who is the author of idolatry namely the diuell himselfe and of that especiall part of it which then he could not effect but hath now obtained in that idolatrous church of rome namely in worshipping of images stocks and stones relikes of saints and of the woodden crosse yes armes legges hands feet and fingers of martyrs whence is al this but from the diuell himselfe who for the same purpose would haue reueiled where moses bodie was buried by god yes so farre haue they gone on in this delusion that they are become spectacles of follie to the whole world for if john baptist had had so many heads as the papists brag of he had been a monster of man besides though the crosse wheron christ was crucified was no greater than as ordinarie man might beare yet so many seuerall peeces thereof they pretend themselues to haue in seuerall places as would load a shippe ob they say they had all those likes by reuelation ans these are but illusion to maintaine idolatry besides that the word being perfect in all matters to bee beleeued or done vnwritten reuelations are no proofes of doctrine but are lu ly to be suspected the third thing in the verse is the manner of his speech in which obserue three things first what speech the archangell would not vse he would not speake euill secondly what speech he vsed the lord rebuke th thirdly the reason or cause of both because he durst not speake euill first of this cause as being first in nature which is s d to bee feare now to know what kinde of feare it was consider that the is a three fold feare first from entire nature secondly from the corruption of nature thirdly from grace the first is a naturall propertie whereby the creature seek to preserue it selfe and to shunne danger which feare is not in it selfe for it was in christ when he said his soule was heauie euen vnto the death and if possible let this cup passe from me but this is not here meant the second feare proceeding from corruption of nature in man and angels is that seruile feare when the creature feareth nothing but due and deserued punishment the conscience being guiltie vnto it selfe and accusing for sinne and the heart destitute of faith and loue of god which if it were present would cast out this slauish feare which is no other than the feare euen of the diuels themselues who beleeue and tremble iam but neither was this the feare of the angell the third feare is from grace and it is a gift of the spirit of god who therefore is called the spirit of feare working in man and angels a care to please and a feare of displeasing god in all things this is the feare here meant which was in the angell in which consider three things further first the beginning of it which is faith euen in the angels themselues whereby they beleeue the power iustice soueraigntie and lordship of god ouer them and that they must be subiect and obedient thereunto but in man it is a faith apprehending the mercie and fauour of god reconciled by christ this feare in angels and man therefore is the fruite of their faith secon y the propertie of is to make the subiect of it to feare the offence of god euill of the world to properly of all because by it god is displeased and in the next of iudgement consequently but the first place psalm trembleth for feare of thee and i stand of thy iudgements this was the religious feare of dauid first a fearing of god offence and then a standing in awe of his iudgements thirdly the vse of it which is to make man and angel make conscience of sin exod the midwiues spare the hebrew it will not suffer the angell hereto reuile the diuell the feare of god saith salomon causeth to euery way yes it frameth to obedience and i because it keepeth the heart from defiling it selfe our dutie hence is to pray that the lord would put into our heart this religious feare which they containe vs in awe of his maiestie and so keepe vs from offences wherein wee may resemble this angell as also to be a welspring of life vnto vs not onely escape the snares of death but to quicken and prouoke vs in the w es of life euerlasting secondly wee must auoide the sinne which the angell was of namely the boldnes of sinning especially in these daies wherein then adventure and rush vpon sinne without feare or shame the second point herein is what speech the archangell would not vse that is cursed speaking or railing iudgement which to know what it is obserue the differences of iudgement which is two fold either publique or priuate publique iudgement i when a man is called by god to iudge the creature and this is two fold first of the magistrate secondly of the minister the magistrate is called by god to seeke out the misdemeanours of man and according to the offence is to pronounce a righteous sentence to the taking away if the cause of the temporall life it selfe the minister is also in the name of god to pronounce the curse of the law vpon vnrepentant sinners and the promise of the gospell vnto the penit nt secondly priuate iudgement is when the creature passeth iudgement against other without calling from god but vpon priuate grudge anger stomacke and reuenge this is here called railing iudgement and it is practised three waies first in speaking falsehoods and vntruths against others secondly in speaking truths but with intent of slandering and detracting from the good name of others thirdly in misconstruing mens sayings and doings to the worst part when they may be taken in the better this railing speech the angell durst not vse hence we learne to make conscience of this sinne of slandering reproching and reuiling others from which the archangell abstained dealing euen with the diuell himselfe but many of vs who can vtter the prouerbe that it is a shame to belie the diuell are contented yes and readie to belie and detract from the children of god our brother by this railing iudgement some will say what may we neuer vse this kind of iudgement ans neuer no not against the diuell but if wee would take vp iudgement against any creature let it bee against our owne selues for our sinnes here we may passe sentence freely and so escape the iudgement of god as for others wee are to iudge by the iudgement of loue which hopeth speaketh thinketh and suspecteth the best and couereth the worst euen a multitude of sinnes the third point is the speech which the archangell vsed in these words the lord rebuke thee which words are a forme of prayer in which he commendeth and remitteth reuenge vnto god desiring that the lord to whom iudgement belongeth would restraine correct and repay the diuell for his malice here it may bee asked what shall we doe when wee are wronged ans learne of the angell not to requite and repay euill for euill neither in action speech or affection but leaue all reuenge vnto the lord zachariah being stoned to death vniustly desired no reuenge but said the lord see and require it christ himselfe being accused before pilate answered nothing and when he died he prayed for those who crucified him matth againe when a man will needs reuenge himselfe of a wrong done against him hee takes vpon him the person of the accuser witnesse iudge and executioner which is against all iustice and equitie besides that the lord challengeth this as his own prerogatiue vengeance is mine and i will repay ob but did not elijah pray for fire from heauen in way of reuenge whereby he destroyed his enemy ans he did but by instinct from god which is as much as a commandement ob but christ when he was smitten said if i haue well said why smitest thou me ans we must put a difference betweene lawful defence of our selues in our good cause and the offence of our aduersaries farre was christ herein from reuenge and so must we ob but this is hard and impossible vnto flesh and blood ans yes but we professe our selues to bee children of our father in heauen and therefore we are to haue more than flesh and blood in vs euen that grace of god which carrieth beleeuers further in christs schoole than flesh and blood can leade them vse schollers and learned man that are to defend god cause and the truth of religion yes euen against very heretikes must abstaine from reuiling speeches if wee be reuiled by the pe of the aduersarie we must commit the iniurie to god secondly people that goe to law with others for most part herein offend that they doe it in way of reuenge and to wrecke their malice vpon their aduersarie whereas the right vse of sui e in law is only to defend a mans right all reuenge laid aside thirdly hence man of valour are taught not to take a challenge into the field it is an honour not to accept of it seeing reuenge is to bee left vnto god let the wrong bee neuer so great fourthly when man be at oddes and difference it is not lawful to chide braule contend crie and lift vp the voyce in threatnings seeing all these are degrees and kindes of reuenge which wee must leaue vnto god qu what must a man doe that is to incounter with the diuel either by temptation possession or otherwise ans hee must follow the practise of the archangel euen flie to god by prayer and intreate him to rebuke him the like practise must be taken vp by those who are to deale with heretikes who seeke the ouerthrow of religion the lord must be intreated to restraine the malice of the diuell that he may not in himselfe or instruments preuaile to corrupt or represse much lesse suppresse or supplant the truth in the former part of this verse is laid downe a third argument which amplifieth the sinne of these deceiuers thus framed for a man to giue sentence and condemne that which hee knoweth not is a point of great iniustice and rashnes but these man condemning magistracie condemne a thing they know not and therefore are iustly accused of rashnes and iniustice the like s ne of these seducers hath been too vsuall in all ages in the daies of the apostles themselues the gentiles accounted the doctrine of the gospell but foolishnes the iewes an offence and yet neither of them knew what it was the same rashnes is at this day to bee descried in the church of rome who haue denounced the sentence of excommunication against our churches and condemne the protestant for heretikes when the most of them neuer knew our doctrine nor neuer heard what wee could say for our selues yes most iniuriously they mistake vs in sundry maine points of doctrine as when wee teach that workes doe not iustifie a man before god they crie out and say we condemne all good workes the same fault is exceeding rise amongst vs in these daies for let a man make conscience of his waies and endeuour to please god he is presently branded with names of reproch by those whose tongues are nimble to speake euill of things they neuer knew who are to know that a man cannot be too precise in keeping the commaundements of god and that themselues haue made a promise in baptisme to walke in no other waies and ought to renew the same so often as they come to the lord table and whatsoeuer things they know naturally in the rest of this verse is set downe the third sinne of these deceiuers which is the sinne of intemperance standing in the immoderate vse of meate and drinke apparell ampc touching this sinne two things are propounded first the proper cause of it that is naturall knowledge in these words whatsoeuer they know naturally secondly the sinne it selfe or the propertie of it in those things they corrupt themselues the cause is because they are guided with a naturall knowledge like the bruite beast which are without reason there be three kindes of knowledge incident vnto the creature first naturall knowledge arising from the instinct of nature common to man and beast and consisting in the senses of sight taste touching ampc by the benefit whereof the beast it selfe can discerne what is food fit for it selfe and what is not what is profitable and what is hurtfull and vnprofitable for it vnto which is ioyned a naturall appetite by the benefit of which the creature can chuse or refuse his food and meate in season the second is reasonable knowledge proper to man and is nothing els but the light of vnderstanding whereby he reacheth farre higher and discerneth meate drinke apparell and rest to be god good gifts and knoweth the ciuill vse of them with the which is ioyned election of will whereby hee can chuse or refuse the ciuill or vnciuil honest or dishonest vse of them this knowledge is in all man for euen the gentiles themselues doe by nature the things contained in the law rom that is ciuilly and outwardly thus many of the heathen haue excelled in ciuill carriage and practise of iustice temperance and other ciuill vertues the third is spirituall knowledge not proceeding either from naturall instinct or reason it selfe but from the enlightening of the spirit of god and it hath sundrie fruits first it enableth man to know these things in their right causes as that these giftes of meates drink amp such like proceed from god not as he is the god of nature only but as by grace in christ he is our god yes our father amp so they become pledges of his speciall mercie seeing they are now restored againe to the beleeuer hauing been formerly lost in adams fall secondly this knowledge causeth man to know them in the due measure of their goodnes and excellencie rightly discerning them from spirituall blessings so as the heart shall not be set vpon them in the first place but vpon the other as of farre higher esteeme yes they shall bee counted as dung in regard of these thirdly it instructeth man in the right vse of them namely when it worketh this perswasion in their hearts that til their persons please god they can neuer vse them well and then onely hee is pleased in their vse of these when as their persons first please him qu what is the thing then condemned in these seducers ans the very sin condemned is that in the vse of the creatures of god they are not guided by reasonable much lesse this spirituall knowledge but onely by nature sense and appetite as the beast is and no otherwise which is the cause of all intemperance hence note the proper cause of the abuse of all god blessings vnto couetousnes pride surfetting drunkennes and other sinnes of that kinde namely because though man haue by nature the vse of reason yet in the vse of these things they lay it aside and follow their own sense and appetite so farre are they from being guided by that higher knowledge which is wrought by the spirit of god secondly from the reprehension we are taught to labor for spirituall knowledge whereby we may be led into the right vse of these temporall things for then and not before shall we vse them as pledges of god mercie in christ vnto vs as the beast cannot and shall hardly be drawne to their abuse in riot and intemperance as these seducers were thirdly in that they are said to bee guided only as the beast which is without reason that is by nature sense and appetite note the practise of the diuel which is to keep man if he can in their naturall knowledge and will not suffer them to attaine to that which is spirituall yes and which is more hee corrupteth also that naturall knowledge which man haue a notable experience hereof we haue in the church of rome which of a famous church is become hereticall and schismaticall the reason of it is because the diuell hath turned all their religion and doctrine into a natural doctrine amp religion the maine points whereof are grounded vpon naturall reason and the learning and philosophie of the heathen and gentiles as iustification by workes merits purgatorie with the rest others not a few amongst our selues also are deluded by this subtilty of satan who suffereth many man to liue ciuilly and honestly among their neighbours but will not brooke that they rise any higher they must content themselues to liue by naturall knowledge hence many man plead they know enough namely to loue god aboue all and their neighbour as themselues and that god is mercifull ampc which is nothing but a sleight of the diuell still to hold them in their naturall knowledge and so within his owne power the second point is the sinne it selfe and propertie of it in those things they corrupt themselues this sin of intemperance causeth man in the abuse of meate drinke and apparell to corrupt themselues here then are two things to be spoken of wherein the whole nature of intemperancie is sufficientlie comprised first of the abuse of the creatures secondly of his corruption that thus abuseth them concerning the former the abuse of the creatures is foure waies first in excesse whe man vse them beyond their calling habilitie or that which nature requireth this maketh the heart heauie forbidden by christ luke secondly in curiositie when man are not content with ordinarie meate drink apparell but deuise new fashions of apparell and new kindes of waies of stirring vp and whetting of appetite thirdly in affection when man so addict themselues to meates and drink as they cannot bee without them the minister must not be one that loueth to sit at the wine nor giuen to wine the affection is here condemned when he cannot sit without the pot at his elbow for else it is indifferent amp for his health sake he may drinke a little wine paul willeth that the ioy in the creature bee as no ioy those also are reproued that drinke not for strength but for drinke sake for although they neither are drunke nor surfet yet this very affection is a sinne fourthly in time when these good creatures are vsed vnseasonably ecclesiastes wee be to the land whose princes rise early to eate a woe is also denounced against those that rise early to drinke wine isai that is out of season the rich man for that he was clad in purple and fared deliciously euery day is branded with a note of intemperance in not obseruing this distinction of times these bee the waies whereby the creatures are abused the second point is how intemperate persons in these things corrupt theselues namely foure waies first in regard of their body vpon which by their sin of intemperance they call sundrie sicknesses diseases yes and hasten their death secondly they deface god image making themselues worse than the beast themselues thirdly they destroy their soules for no drunkard or riotous person shal inherit heauen corinthian fourthly they ouerthrow their families in wasting th ir substance to the maintaining of their intemperance and so bring ruine to the places where they liue vse in these seducers we haue a glasse wherein to behold the state of our daies and times in which intemperance hath taken place not only in prophane houses but eue in religious places amp where reformation is professed a common practise it is to drink with glasses without feete which must neuer rest also by the bell the die the douzen the yard and other measures amp then vse tabacco or other meanes to sharpen appetite still an horrible sin exceeding this sin of these seducers themselues secondly seeing intemperance bringeth iust corruption and in the end destructio vpon the offenders we must make conscience of sobrietie and temperance this is the end of god grace which hath appeared to teach vs to liue soberly tit and whosoeuer cannot obtaine thus much of himselfe to deny the abuse of creatures will neuer attaine to the deniall of himselfe for christ his sake and is as yet a man of no religion but for the defending of this murthering sinne some things are alleaged ob gen vlt ioseph and his brother did eate amp drink and were drunke together hagge the people are threatned to drinke but not to drunkennes wherfore drunkennes is not unlawful yes it is a curse to drinke and not to be drunke ans these places may indeed be thus translated but then drunkennes is taken two waies first for excesse in drink of which the places alleaged speake not secondly for liberall or plentifull drink and this may bee done in a holie manner so ioseph with his brother eat and dranke liberally and plentifully but not excessiuely so the people were threatned in hagge to drinke but not to sa ietie and plentifulnes ob ioh it is said the guests had well drunke yet christ turned water into wine still and commaunded the ministers to draw forth ans this only sheweth what we may doe namely vse the creatures of god in plentifull and liberall manner vpon such occasions as this but iustifieth not intemperance or excesse in the vse of them ob it is an ancient rule that in some olde and lingering diseases it is good to be drunke therefore it is lawful vpon some occasion to be drunke ans this cannot be done in good conscience being an unlawful meanes to cure any disease though old and vsed ob but some say they can drinke and neuer be drunke they can beare more away than two or three ans w e vnto them that are strong to drinke wine and strong drinke there is a curse of god against them who vse needlesse drink though they neuer surfet nor be drunke q for what ends may we vse the creatures and in what manner ans the lawful end of their vse is two fold first for necessitie to preserue life and health secondly for our lawful and honest delight psalm god giueth bread to strengthen the heart and oyle also to make his countenance glad christ suffered a woman to powre a boxe of pretious oyntment vpon his head himself was at a feast in galeley and forbad not the liberal vse of wine secondly for the manner and measure we must knowe that one man cannot herein be a rule to another one mans stomack and health craueth more another lesse but euery man must obserue this rule of sobrietie that he haue alwaies an eye to spirituall exercises as praier hearing of the word meditation as also to the workes and duties of his speciall calling and so much as fitteth a man vnto these is his measure and when a man by the creatures maketh himselfe heauie and vnfit for these he hath exceeded his measure in the former words of the verse w e vnto them is laid downe the conclusion of the principall argument of the epistle namely that these seducers shall be destroyed hauing taken vnto themselues libertie of sinning which he hath alreadie prooued by a particular enumeration of the sinnes vnto which they were addicted and further amplifieth that second part of the reason by the reckoning vp of diverse other sinnes both in this verse and in the rest vnto the twentith first of the conclusion w e vnto them here first it may bee demaunded why or how the apostle dare pronounce such a peremptorie sentence against them and that of euerlasting condemnation seeing the archangell durst not passe iudgement no not against the diuell himselfe ans there be two grounds of this practise first god giueth to all prophets apostles and ministers the power of the keyes whereby they retaine and binde vp some mens sinnes to destruction as also to remit and loose the sins of some others in both which they pronounce iudgement generally secondly god gaue yet a further power vnto prophets and apostles which is denied now to ordinarie ministers whereby reuealing vnto them his speciall iudgements against particular persons hee made them his instruments to pronounce these his iudgements against man euen in particular thus dauid psalm cursed particular persons paul curseth alexander the coppersmith tim and gal would to god they were euen cut off that trouble you and by the same spirit of reuelation the apostle discerned this woe most certainly to befall these seducers vse hence the papists conclude that prophets and apostles and cosequently the popes may make laws to binde the conscience because they haue power ouer it it being lawful for them to curse bodie and soule answer a creature may bee cursed two waies first by imposing a curse and inflicting it vpon the bodie soule or conscience this is the peculiar curse of god resting in his power alone and is not committed to prophets apostles or ministers for it argueth such a power ouer the soule as may saue or destroy it secondly by foretelling and pronouncing a curse to come which god will inflict and this is that which belongeth to prophets apostles and ministers but this argueth no power at al ouer the conscience secondly some hence may conceiue that they haue warrant to curse other creatures man or beast seeing the apostle vseth it ans this practise of the apostle hauing an extraordinary spirit of reuelation is no rule for any man no not for the minister ordinarily called our rule left vs by christ is to blesse and not curse mat rom which must be vnderstood of particular persons for otherwise the minister hath authoritie to accurse impenitent sinners in generall but not this or that particular person no not in god cause for he knowes not what shall be the future estate of this or that man in particular much lesse may priuate man in priuate causes vse cursings or imprecations against others which condemneth their wicked practise who in their anger and impatience breake out into cursing of their childre servant friends yes or enemy our contrary duty must be to blesse as we are called vnto blessing thirdly marke the apostles disposition they were themselues most meek in dealing with man who called others vnto meeknes their own patient minds were knowne vnto all man in all the matters of man but when god glorie was called into question and the saluation of man likely to be hindred they lay aside their meekenes and put on seueritie and roughnes their zeale in god matters would not admit such lenitie and patience as towards man in mens matters they were willing to exercise they had an apostolicall r d which in such cases they vsed against offenders moses the meekest man vpon the earth when he saw the israelites worship the golden calfe was so incensed with wrath that hee brake the tables which were in his hands and tooke his sword and together with the leuites slew three thousand of them the same day exod christ himselfe though hee would not breake a brused reede yet dealing with the scribes and pharisies who had corrupted the whole lawe laded them with woes and curses matth paul who otherwise was all things to all man yet when god glory was impared by elymas his withstanding of him he strook him blinde and cursed alexander out of a rightly ordered and holie zeale all which examples teach vs the like religious affection that when god honor is in hazard our zeale should be inflamed when mans saluation is likely to be hindred our meeknes must be for the time set aside that the zeale of god house may euen consume vs psalm as it did christ himselfe when he saw his fathers house dishonoured and of a house of prayer made a denne of theeues vnto whom we are daily to be conformed they haue followed the way of caine in these words the apostle returneth to the former part of the reason whereby he hath alreadie by three forenamed sinnes proued that these seducers are they which take libertie to sinne and vnto them addeth this fourth that they haue followed the way of caine in which first we will shew the meaning of the words and then obserue the doctrines in the former consider two things first what is the way of caine secondly why they are said to walke in this way of caine the way of caine is that course of life which caine took vp to himself in following the lusts of his owne heart against the will of god it is described in gen of which way there be seuen steps or degrees but euery one out of the right way the first step was his hypocrisie he worshipped god by offring sacrifice as abel did but his heart was not a beleeuing heart as abel was his worship was outward amp ceremonious but not in spirit and truth for his heart was an euill heart of vnbeleefe the second his hatred of his owne onely and naturall brother prosecuting him with wrath and indignation testified by the casting downe of his countenance vpon him the reason of all which was because his own works were euill and his brothers good ioh so as his brothers offer being accepted and his reiected he feared that abel might get the birthright and become the priest prophet and king in the familie and euery way as he deserued be preferred before him for thus much is signified in these words genes that if he did well abels affection should bee subiect vnto him and he should hold his rule ouer him the third his murther whereby hee slew his righteous brother the fourth his lying vnto god saying he knew not where his brother was hauing slaine him and extenuating his sinne denied himselfe to be his brothers keeper the fifth his desperation after that god had conuicted him and pronounced sentence against him for being cursed for his sinne he cutteth himselfe off from the mercie of god in saying my punishment is greater than i am able to beare the sixth his securitie and carelesnes hee regardeth not his sinne nor the conscience of it but busieth himselfe in building a citie and calleth it after the name of his child that seeing his name was not written in heauen he might yet preserue his name and memorie in the earth the seuenth and last which was the highest step of his way was his prophanenes for from thencefoorth he cast off and contemned all the care and practise of god worship which appeareth gen then man began to call vpon the name of the lord which wordes haue relation to the whole chapter going before concerning caine and his posteritie who had vtterly reiected the seruice of god and betaken themselues to other affaires caine himselfe to his building lamech to his lust being the first founder of polygamie for hee tooke vnto him two wiues iabal to the framing and pitching of tents iubal to musicke tubal caine to other curious works but when enoch was borne then man began to affect better things to call vpon the name of the lord then the true worship of god formerly neglected began to bee restored this is the path wherein caine walked the second point is in what regard these seducers are said to follow cain way and that is in regard of all these seuen sinnes but especially in the hatred and crueltie which he practised against his brother for as he was bloodily and maliciously minded towards his brother though he gaue him good words till he saw his time conuenient to execute his conceiued malice so is it with these seducers they may seeme for the season otherwise affected yet indeed they carrie a hatefull affection to the church of god and against those also that endeuour in the building vp of the same doct hence first note that the way of caine is the high and broad way of the world the turks and jew follow caines footsteps in the profession and practise of all prophanenes in that they denie and despise the messias the son of god yes and persecute with a deadly hatred all christians and are neuer satisfied with the spilling of their blood the way of the papists also is the way of caine carrying within them the same heart towards protestant which caine did towards abel without any conuiction of them either of heresie or of wickednes and no otherwise than caine they now carrie themselues quietly and silently till opportunitie may serue them which if it were offered we should feele and haue fearefull experience of the fruits of a cainish heart in them as abel did besides the doctrine of the roman church teacheth the way of caine for it stadeth wholy in outward ceremonies borrowed partly from the iewes partly from the heathen yes it traineth vp man to bee hypocrites because it is onely a dumbe and dead shew without any power or life of godlines againe it teacheth desperation in that by it no man ought to be assured of his saluation for that were presumption as also that a man must satisfie the iustice of god for his sinnes and can neuer obtaine pardon without confession of all his sinnes in the eare of the priest and to come neerer home euen among our selues this way of cain is not vnbeaten our hypocrisie lying malice but aboue all our prophanenes will conuince vs hereof doe not man goe backward in religion as those that shake off the waies of god is not the gospell of farre lesse reckoning among vs than it hath been heretofore is that wholsome doctrine not lesse respected now than it was twentie yeeres agoe and much lesse therfore obeyed which is a manifest argument that caines way is generally the beaten way of this age doct secondly wee must be warned to turne out of the way of caine into the waies of god qu which is the way of god that wee may walke in it ans it is altogether contrarie to the way of caine for first in god way is sinceritie god is worshipped in the spirit and not in hypocrisie secondly loue of god and man testified in word and deede opposed to cains hatred thirdly in god way is faith which resteth vpon god mercie and prouidence euen against feeling both in life and death opposed to caines desperation fourthly wisedome whereby the heart is stirred vp to seeke god kingdome peace of conscience inward ioy and in the second place for the things of this life fifthly in god way is faithfulnes and constancie man that begin in the spirit end not in the flesh but are faithfull to the death whereas the way of caine is to begin with sacrifice but end in profanenes this is the way of god in which we must walke vsing all good meanes whereby wee may be both set and contained therein especially the word preached and the sacraments which meanes the very pharisie himselfe could acknowledge when he said to christ master thou teachest the way of god truly so the prophet esay saith ye shall heare a voyce behind you saying this is the way walk in it this voice is nothing but the voice of the spirit in the ministrie of the word doct thirdly note what these seducers are blamed for namely for two things first for making choise of cains way secondly for walking and going on forward in it which is a propertie of the wicked it is true that the childe of god by the frailtie of the flesh may slip into caines way as dauid did in slaying vriah but hee doth not stand goe on and keepe a course in that way as the wicked doe being branded to be such as stand in the way of sinners psalm we on the contrarie must preserue a care to recouer our selues out of the way of caine if at any time we shall be misled into it that if we cannot keepe from al sinne yet we may be kept from a course and trade in sinning let this christian care preserue our paths in the waies of god and returne vs vnto the obedience of his will when through many weaknesses and slips we often are turned aside and the rather because caines and attendeth caines whole course who was haunted with an euill and accusing conscience whose sinne lay at the doore as a wilde beast readie to teare him and pull out the throte of his soule besides that he was accursedly cast from the presence and face of god that howsoeuer hee was a prince and mightie amongst man yet he was a vagabond and runnagate on the face of the earth which curses let them not looke to auoide whosoeuer will follow his way no more than caine himselfe could and are cast away by the deceit of balaams wages in these wordes is set downe the fifth sinne of these seducers the meaning of which is first to bee knowne cast away the word signifieth they are powred out or powred away which forme of speech is taken from water the which distilleth not out of a vessell drop by drop but is powred out in abundance till so all is quickly spent whereby the apostle would giue vs to vnderstand that in the affection of their hearts they were violent and euen carried headlong to commit their wickednesse by the deceit of balaams wages that is they are thus forcibly carried to doe euill vpon hope of wages of which hope notwithstanding they are disappointed and defeated as balaam was so as this fifth sinne is couetousnes propounded in a similitude or comparison of which there are two branches first as balaam was carried headlong to curse the people of god in hope of wages so these wicked man vpon hope of reward are set to falsifie and corrupt the doctrine of the prophets and apostles secondly as balaam was deceiued and frustrated of the reward hoped for as numb hee lost his reward yes and after his life for returning home hee was slaine by the midianites so shall these lose their reward which they expect for falsifying that doctrine which they teach and so much for the meaning that which was the sinne of these seducers is the sinne of these times of ours wherein that prophesie of peter is accomplished where is foretold that false teachers should come in the latter times who through couetousnes with fained words should make merchandise of mens soules quest but where shall we finde these couetous teachers ans they are too easily found euery where but especially within the precincts of the church of rome the bishop of rome and the guides of that church are the archseducers who through couetousnes make merchandise of mens soules teaching first that a man must confesse all his sinnes or else hee cannot be forgiuen and when he hath reckoned vp all hee must satisfie for them in that manner as they will prescribe who commonlie enioyne man to bestow so much land or such a summe or pension of money vpon this or that church or abbey that so they may buy out a pardon by which wicked doctrine through couetousnes they haue by encroching vpon country and kingdomes enriched themselues and purchased or rather craftily conueyed to themselues the greatest part of the reuenewes of all europe secondly they through couetousnes maintaine the distinction betweene mortall and veniall sinnes betweene the fact and the punishment and hold that the sinne may be remitted but not the punishment for which purpose the fire of hell is changed by them into a milder fire of purgatorie to bee suffered after this life of which the pope is lord and king indulgent to whom he please especially to those that can pay well for the merits of others or masses of their own this painted fire hath a long time kept the fire of the popes kitchin so bright burning which if it should goe out his state were shaken thirdly through couetousnes they forbid many degrees of man from marriage which god forbiddeth not that so they may the oftner dispense with those degrees which themselues haue forbidden for the more dispensations the more wealth haue they comming in and thus is their whole religion contriued and plotted for gaine compacted of falsehood and couetousnes so as peters prediction is most fully accomplished in these balaamites of rome but especially herein the pope is become a second balaam in that as balaam cursed god people for gaine so to maintaine his owne pompe and state by his buls and thunderbolts hath he assaied to curse euen kings and princes and some whole kingdomes yes all such as haue shaken off his intolerable antichristian yoke the same accusation may be lustly intended against verie many that professe godlinesse and true religion for these be the last daies and perilous times wherein man shall be louers of themselues couetous ampc tim such as ieremy complained of iere from the least to the greatest euery one is giuen to couetousnes from the prophet vnto the priest they deale all falsely the vsuries oppressions iniustice the common craft and customable deceit in all trade crie out of this sinne of couetousnes in all estates but some will perhaps here say yes but you wrong christians to charge them thus deeply with balaams sinne for they haue better things in them ans but it is no iniustice for balaam had some as good things in him as many christians for when he was first solicited of balaak to curse the people of god he would not till he asked leaue of god and when god had denied him leaue he answered him that he would not go with him if hee would giue him his house full of gold and siluer further he desired earnestly to die the death of the righteous and that his end might be like his iudas also had many good things in him he left all to follow christ he became a preacher of the truth none of the disciples could accuse him or could espie any thing in him and yet was carried away with couetousnes so let no man obiect the good things in many christians which i grant they may haue and yet too eagerly hunt after the world yes and be powred out also after filthie lucre no otherwise than balaam was now for the auoiding of this sinne let vs obserue three things which the apostle admonisheth in the words first in that he saith they are powred out we are giuen to vnderstand that the affection of couetousnes is a most violent headstrong affection carrying a man headlong to sinne euen against conscience as it did balaam and causing him to powre out his heart vnto wickednes achans couetousnes could not be curbed no not by god speciall commandement the wedge of gold and the babylonish garmet did so sway with him ahab was sicke of couetousnes no physicke could recouer him but naboths vineyard and life iudas for thirtie peeces of siluer was carried against al sense to the betraying of his master and that after diverse admonitions ananias and saphira to saue but a little money make no bones of lying vnto the holy ghost what is the cause of all treacheries and those most cruell murthers of fathers of mothers of servant and strangers but the couetous heart set vpon the bootie saying to it selfe by this fact this house that land such a summe of money shall be mine which obiect in the eye putteth out all the light of religion reason and sometimes of nature it selfe thus the heart is easily powred out vnto euill when as first it is possessed with couetousnes which paul calleth the roote of all euill secondly the apostle would haue vs consider how hard a thing it is to be recouered from this sinne seeing such a sinner is powred out and cast away by the deceit of it and indeede little hope is there of the repentance of a couetous man of whom christ was bold to say that as easie it is for a camell to goe thorough the eye of a needle as a rich man to enter into heauen the reason is because his couetous cares choke and hinder the word from taking place in his hart and so hee frustrateth all meanes of his saluation againe he hath renounced the true god and set vp another god in his heart the idols in our church are defaced and destroyed by the magistrate but the diuell setteth vp idols still in the hearts of man which ought to bee god temples euen riches the god of greedie man thirdly obserue that in god iust iudgement the couetous man is disappointed of his hope his wages are the wages of deceitfulnes for either he atchieueth not or retaineth not the things expected as in the former examples of achan who for the wedge lost his life with it so neither ahab himselfe nor his posteritie euer enioyed naboths vineyard iudas brought backe the thirtie peeces of siluer and hanged himselfe ananias and saphira desirous to keepe a part of their possession lost with the possession both their liues or else if hee retaine the bootie and get and keepe also wealth fraudulently gotten and heaped vp by oppression yet hauing the thing he hath not the vse of it his couetous heart keepeth the key of it and locketh it from his comfortable vse yes and be it that he haue some vse of it yet his gaine is small for which he loseth his soule thou foole this night shal they fetch away thy soule vse we are all hence admonished especially aged and rich persons to beware of this dangerous sinne it becommeth saints not to haue couetousnes once named among them ephesian our practise is to varnish it ouer with termes of thriftines and good husbandrie and the worst it heareth of vs is scarse a smal dislike so as when wee speake of a wreched worldling we say he is an honest man but somewhat hard or worldly so as this sinne is in no disgrace among the most as it deserueth being both so odious vnto god and hurtfull vnto the sinner himselfe but let vs consider first that it easily draweth a man vnto perdition and enwrappeth him in the diuels snare tim those that will be rich fall into many temptations and snares wheresoeuer it ruleth that man respecteth not commandement reason conscience no nor common honestie it selfe secondly wee professe our selues to be members of christ the son and daughters of god now such a base sinne beseemeth not such an high profession for a noble man or a prince apparent to spend and trifle away his time in buying and selling pinnes and points were a madnes what a base follie were it for vs that hope to bee heires of the kingdome of glorie to bee still po ing on earth and earthly things whose hearts and affections should be raised vp higher and taken vp with heauenly meditations vsing weanedly this world as though we vsed it not thirdly nature is contented with a little and is surfetted with abundance and yet grace is pleased with lesse and therefore if we haue food and raiment for vs and ours let vs bee there with contented tim qu but what shall we doe then doe not all man thus and may not wee seeke wealth as others doe ans the rule of the word must bee our direction herein and not the manner of the world and that aduiseth vs to make god our portion which lesson god himselfe taught abraham gen i am thy buckler and thy exceeding great reward dauid had learned this lesson psalm the lord is my portion this is done by setting our loue our ioy our principall care yes our hearts and affections vpon the lord as man doe vpon their treasures by which meanes if riches increase our hearts shall not be set vpon them for they are not our portion and if we be pinched and pressed with aduersitie want or losses yet shall we not be oppressed for we want nothing but that we may well be without and haue not as yet lost any part of our portion further in the phrase which the apostle vseth they are powred away note a difference between the child of god and a wicked man when both of them are found in the same sinne but the one powreth out himselfe to wickednes giueth himselfe leaue to sin with full consent without restraint yes with greedines the other sinneth with consent but not full consent for being regenerate hee is not all flesh as the wicked man but partly flesh partly spirit and therefore partly willeth and consenteth to sin partly nilleth amp consenteth not he is not powred out without restraint as the other is but at length recouereth himselfe by repentance and obtaineth reconciliation with god secondly we must beware of powring out our selues to wickednes but rather with annah powre out our soules before the lord in humble confession of sinne and petition for pardon that so the lord may powre foorth his mercie vpon vs and shed his loue abroad in our hearts thirdly we may not content our selues with a few or some good things for the hart may notwithstanding be powred foorth to sinne as balaam and iudas but seeke carefully to haue our hearts truly seasoned with grace with the loue and feare of god which for the present will cause vs to decline euerie euill way yes to detest and hate euery sinne and for time to come with a resolute and constant purpose and endeuour neuer to offend god againe for otherwise a shew of some good things may often deceiue and delude vs and wee may perish for all them as balaam did lastly we are hence taught neuer to giue reines to our affections and desires but curbe crucifie and mortifie them carefully for if once they get head and bee yeelded vnto they will not easily be subdued nor suffer a ma quiet til he haue powred forth himself vnto all wickednes and so brought him into the high way of perdition and are perished in the gainsaying of core in these words the apostle laieth downe the sixth sinne of these seducers to vnderstand the meaning whereof consider two things first the historie it selfe secondly the application of it the historie is recorded in numb wherin moses mentioneth three things concerning corah first the cause of his sinne which was ambition and pride for core being a leuite affected the priesthood of aaron and dathan and abiram being heads of the tribe of ruben stroue to take the gouernment of the people out of moses his hand who was appointed by god as king ouer the israelites deut secondly the sinne it selfe namely in this their discontentment they enterprised an insurrection against moses and aaron they stood vp against them contradicted and gainsaid them in their offices and charged them first that they vsurped authoritie and tooke too much vpon them and lifted vp themselues aboue the congregation without the lord verse and therefore they would not obey moses commaundement verse and secondly that moses had dealt deceitfully with the people and onely in policie to make himselfe a king had promised them a land flowing with milk and honey whereas they saw no such matter nay rather hee had brought them out of egypt to destroy them in the wildernes ver thirdly their punishment for their sin which was an horrible destruction vpon them and their company being all of them partly swallowed vp of the earth partly deuoured by fire from heauen verse secondly the historie of corah dathan and abiram is applied to these false teachers by way of comparison and they are compared in two things first as core and his company most ambitiously and proudly gainsaid moses and aaron so doe these false teachers the doctrine of the prophets and apostles secondly as they were destroyed for their such resistance euen so shall these perish in their gainsaying of the truth thus the meaning of the words is made plaine this epistle was writte for a warning vnto the last times euen vnto vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come and therfore that which is affirmed of these man is verified in sundrie sorts of man in this age for example first the bishop of rome is the next follower of core for looke as core gainsaid moses and aaron in regard of their lawful authoritie so doth the pope gainsay christian kings and princes in striuing to take out of their hands all their power and authoritie in causes ecclesiastical within their owne dominions nay herein he goeth beyond core in that hee vsurpeth that power ouer them which the lord hath put into their owne hands and so being inuested in their own persons most rightfully belongeth vnto themselues secondly his shauelings and masse priests not onely gainsay and contradict christ in his doctrine but also attempt to vsurpe his office in offring a real and proper sacrifice of attonement for the sinnes of the quicke and dead yes and wherein they strip core they take vpon them to become mediatours betweene christ and the father in praying the father that he would accept the sacrifice of his son as hee did the sacrifice of abel thirdly of this sort are all traytors and rebels either priests or iesuits or other traiterously minded man at home or abroad who no otherwise than core gainsay the ordinance of god and stand out in deniall or resistance of their lawful and naturall prince whom he same punishment shall assuredly finde out which consumed corah and his company in the end of their conspiracie fourthly many amongst vs who professe the gospel yet walke in the gainsaying of core of who some wil openly say they not what the ministers speake whatsoeuer it is they will withstand it yes many wretched creatures who come to the lord table will not sticke to say that they hope to see the day when they shall bee hanged which argueth them to bee abetter in the wicked conspiracie of gore lastly it were to bee wished that some of our students euen of diuinitie had not a spice of this sinne of core for within this sixe or seuen yeeres diverse haue addicted themselues to studie popish writers and monkish discourses despising in the meane time the writing of hose famous instruments and cleere lights whom the lord raised vp for the raising and restoring of true religion such as luther caluin bucer be a martyr ampc which argueth that their mindes are alienated from the sinceritie of the truth because the writings of these the soundest expositors of the scriptures raised since the apostles are not sauourie vnto them yes some can reuile these worthie lights themselues which is a spice of corinthian his sinne doctr secondly hence wee are taught to beware of ambition and studie to bee contented with that condition of life wherein god hath placed vs not seeking things beyond our estate dauid would not meddle with things beyond his reach psalm paul had learned in euery estate to bee conted to be abased as well as to be exalted our first parents in the ambitious conceit of further highnes fell from a most happie condition and brought ruine vpon themselues and vs their posteritie the vertue of contentation is indeed necessarie for al man but especially let students seeke it at the hands of god and the rather because that within these few yeeres diverse of them not possessing the benefit of this vertue being frustrated here of their expected preferments which they thought were due to their gifts haue departed away discontented and haue growne to resolution in heresie popery treason and most desperate attempts now that euery man may learne to bee contented with his conditio be it better or worse let him think well vpon these two considerations first that the present estate and condition of life wherin euery man is set by god is the best estate for him health is best in time of health and sicknes in time of sicknes riches when they are enioyed pouertie and want when the lord changeth his hand life whilest he liueth yes and death it self is the best when as that change befalleth and all this is because the lord so ordereth and disposeth vnto euery man out of his wise prouidence which wee for our parts must in all our thoughts be submitted vnto secondly that in regard of our sinnes we are lesse than the least of god mercies vnworthie to draw breath in the common ayre or to tread vpon the earth and therefore being so vnworthie if we haue but small amp few blessings wee may well content our selues for by our deserts wee cannot challenge so much as wee haue iacob herein staied himselfe in his want that he was vnworthie of the least mercie of god the basest calling is too good for the best man if hee looke at his desert ob but euery man is preferred before me and yet i deserue as well as they or some of them ans herein content thy self god hath called them to such condition stay till he call thee distract not thy thoughts herewith but rest in his reuealed will doct thirdly it may seeme strange that core amp his company should gainsay moses and aaron and their authoritie especially beholding all the miracles whereby their calling was confirmed the one to be prince the other the high priest and yet we see it to be so for his affection had blinded his conscience hee knew very well that they were called by god he saw their whole religious course the great miracles in their hands but yet the disordred affections of his hart were they which blinded the vnderstanding of his minde in like manner man may marueile that so many learned papists otherwise so wise and prudent should maintaine so many grosse errors and heresies and those against the foundation of religion but the case is with them as it was with core for let them bee neuer so learned graue and wise yet their wicked heart and ambitious affections ouercast their iudgement and knowledge and ouercarrie them against conscience yes and often reason it selfe they reade the bible the word of truth but see not the truth therein contained because the clowd of corrupt affections hath ouerspread and darkned their vnderstandings whence wee may learne that if at any time wee would with fruite heare reade studie of learne the word of god we must bring with vs not only quick vnderstandings sharpe conceits and firme memories but honest hearts calme and tempered affections without which it shall bee with vs as wish the iewes who saw indeed and yet perceiued not fourthly here magistrates and ministers must learne not to be discouraged if they be gainsaid and contradicted by such as core datha and abiram who were great man in their tribes it was moses and aarons lot christ himselfe was a rocke of offence and stumbled at him he was made a wonder of man and few of the great beleeued his doctrine yes few there were that did not gainsay it it is not well with man when all man speake well of them meeke moses shall haue his patience tried by very many such in the world fifthly students especially of diuinitie must take heede of this spirit of contradiction and gainesaying whereby no wholesome doctrine can easily please them which was cores sinne and content themselues with that truth of doctrine and those sound grounds of diuinitie which are propounded in the writings of those famous and excellent instruments aforenamed who were the restorers of pure religion preferring them before all popish writers and corrupt postillers in whom a man shall meete with nothing sooner than error and vnsoundnes and reading seriously their workes and writings as the soundest and best grounds of diuinitie and expositions of the scriptures which haue been set out since the daies of the apostles sixthly let inferiours hence learne obedience and silent subiection vnto superiours the servant or subiect must not be a gainsaier nay not an answerer againe tit this cutteth off all disputation betweene the master and servant father and childe prince and subiect for the very appearance of cores sinne must be auoided seuenthly core gainsaieth both moses and aaron the one in regard of his magistracie the other of his priesthood these two sinnes goe hand in hand he that opposeth himself to moses despiseth aaron also he that honoreth not the king feareth not god he that careth not for the word is not loyall to his prince a rebell to god is a rebell to his prince seeing then loyaltie towards god and the king are so linkt together in themselues let vs not sunder them but rather conioyne them in our practise as the apostle hath coupled them in one precept commanding vs to feare god and honour the king eightly it may be here demaunded whether haue we done well in gainsaying and contradicting the church of rome seeing our church before the time of k henry the was a member of that church ans when two are at strife both are not be blamed but the partie in whom the cause is conuinced to be we haue indeede departed from them but the cause of our departure was not in vs but in themselues we haue departed from them as the israelites by god commandement from the tents of core they haue first a long time gainsaid christ and therefore we haue well done to gainsay them we are not therefore the schismatikes neither blame worthie but they in whom the cause of schisme is no more than moses was here to be blamed the cause resting in core lastly it will be asked what did moses all this while that he was gainsaid ans he fell on his face and prayed vnto the lord wherein he became a fit president for vs in this land who haue been aboue fourtie yeeres assaulted by popish cores enemy and rebels without and within vs from whom we haue bin defended not so much by the sword as by god protection obtained by the prayers of his servant which teacheth vs for time to come to turne vs to this most ready course of subduing al gainsaiers and enemy of our peace for the direct way to discouer conspiracies to subdue treasons and rebels and to purchase tranquillitie to a church and land is to commend the safetie thereof vnto the lord fauourable protection whose eyes are euer watchfull ouer his people and thus much of core his sinne the last point is their punishment in which it may be asked how they perished ans it is commonly thought that core dathan and abiram were swallowed vp of the earth but i take it that all the man of core al his substance and his tents dathan also and abiram were swallowed vp of the earth but that core himselfe was burned with fire from heauen with the man that offered incense verse for in the historie numb it is said that dathan and abiram and the man of core were swallowed vp but core himselfe is not mentioned so deut and psalm in both which places dathan and abiram are said to be swallowed vp with their households but in neither place is core mentioned secondly dathan and abiram were in their tents and so were the man of core also when the earth opened and swallowed them verse but corah and the two hundred and fiftie man were at the doore of the tabernacle with their censors fire and incense and were deuoured with fire from heauen verse ob number the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them that is dathan and abiram with core ans the learned expound that place not of cores person but his substance amp retinue marke here the iust iudgement of god corah had abused himselfe being a leuite his office and those sacrifices which he offered by fire and the lord destroied him by fire the same was the dealing of god with nadab and abihu leuit looke in what things man sin and dishonour god by those for the most part the lord reuengeth himselfe vpon them so man glorie in abusing the creatures of god as meats wine and strong drink the lord in the meane time secretly turneth the same to their owne destruction that those which are his good gifts and ordained for the preseruation of nature being by man abused through god iust iudgement are turned to the choking and ouerturning of nature secondly hence learne the wise counsell of salomon prou feere god honour the king and meddle not with the seditions or with them that make alterations for although it be lawful for a subiect being called to shew his minde what he thinketh meete for the church or common wealth yet for a priuate man to attempt vpon his owne head to alter any thing standing by god and the princes law is no better than sedition and is a branch of corah his sinne thirdly although corah dathan and abiram are destroyed for this sinne yet cores children are not destroyed but spared numb god in iustice remembring his mercie his care for the ministerie was such as could not suffer the leuites race to bee rooted out but preserued for the vse of the tabernacle let god care teach vs our dutie in this behalf namely to applie our best endeuours for the maintaining and preseruing the schooles of learning for the vse and seruice of the church commendable hath been the care of many kings and princes in this behalf whom wee should imitate in preseruing these seed plots of the ministerie for herein they imitate the great king euen god himselfe in these words the apostle setteth downe the seuenth sin of these seducers to know the meaning whereof the better consider foure things first what is meant by feasts of loue and charitie ans in the primitiue church it was a custome and manner to haue a feast before the lord supper made by the communicants vnto which some brought hony some bread some wine some milke and euery one according to their abilitie contributing somthing thereunto these were here meant and called loue feasts because they were herein to testifie their mutuall loue among themselues as also to the poore who hereby were relieued and to the ministerie it selfe which was by these feasts partly sustained secondly what is meant where these seducers are called spots in these feasts or rocks for the word signifieth either and more properly the latter they are rocks because as rocks are perceiued a farre off by the seafaring man euen so the infection of these wicked man spreads it selfe very farre and againe as rockes are dangerous and troublesome to them so are these as rockes and stumbling blockes to the weake hindring them from the profitable progresse in godlines they are also rightly called spots because as a spot defaceth the countenance so their presence is an eye sore amp a disgrace vnto these loue feasts the third thing is the cause why they are thus called that is because in these loue feasts they feede themselues for laying aside all care of the poore amp of the ministrie for whose sake this contribution was made they pampered and fed themselues riotously wasting the goods of the church the fourth is the cause of this their riot without feare that is because they haue cast off the feare of god and man in these words therefore the apostle chargeth these false teachers not only with intemperance in generall but also with a special kind of riot in mispending and wasting the contribution pertaining to the poores maintenance and the sustaining of the ministerie vse that which is spoken of these me may be applied to these last times wherein diverse man riotously abuse the goods specially prouided for the maintenance of the ministerie and poore as first the roman clergie those locusts that come foorth of the mouth of the beast idle bellies and slow backes the most of which want learning and are vnable to teach the people yet feede themselues without feare so as their eyes are swollen with fatnes wealth they want not hauing craftily conueied vnto themselues the third part of the reuenewes of europe but with it do nothing but pamper themselues secondly such patrones are here included as feede themselues with church liuings appointed for y e relieuing of the poore and maintenance of the ministerie in such sort as god people cannot bee faithfully and sufficiently taught they can bee content to depart from some ten pounds a yere to some vnable man so as they may of the rest feede themselues without feare or else as some doe serue their lusts in mispending the churches reuenewes vpon hawkes hounds and other improfitable rauenous creatures thirdly such students whether fellowes or schollers of or in colledges as mispend their time in idlenes gaming or other improfitable exercises come also within the compasse of the apostles reprehension as feeders of themselues with that salarie or liuing which was giue for the maintenance of the ministerie here a question may be demaunded namely whether those whom wee call lay man hauing church lands amp liuings impropriate vnto them may bee said with these seducers to feede themselues without feare or whether can any man impropriate any church goods or liuings without sacriledge ans the answer hereof is two fold first though no good member of the church can in good conscience seeke the harme and preiudice of the same yet the plaine truth is that the church goods and lands may bee sometimes vpon some occasions alienated the groud of which answere is this rule namely that the gouernours of the church are to content themselues with things necessarie for when the people had brought sufficient for the building of the tabernacle moses biddeth them bring no more seeing saith he there is enough so as when the church hath too much and excesse as the roman church amp these churches of europe gotten by masses purgatorie dirge sacrament of penance ampc there may be admitted alienation and impropriation of church goods and l nds but so as two conditions must be necessarily obserued first there must be iust cause and that which is so alienated must bee employed to some good vse in the church or commonwealth and this is foure waies first in case of present necessitie for tenths haue bin in some cases of necessity lawfully paied in way of tribute and otherwise neither church nor common wealth could haue been preserued secondly in way of exchange when the alienation of some lands shall be rather more conuenient both to the church it selfe and to whom such lands are alienated thirdly when as some great profit shal ensue vnto the church and common wealth vpon which ground king henry the of famous memorie most iustly alienated most of y e church lands called abbey lands that monks friers abbots and such like idle drones should neuer haue more footing in this our land fourthly in way of reward for kings and princes that are the patrons amp protectors of the church may alienate church lands where there are excesse vnto such as haue bin faithfull in the defence of church or common wealth and that in way of requitall and reward of their seruice the second condition is that there must bee reserued a sufficient reliefe for the poore and maintenance for an able ministerie some there are which teach otherwise and they reason thus tenths say they standing by god law are not to bee alienated but the goods and lands of the church stand chiefly in tenths and therefore admit no alienation ans in england tenths stad not by god laws but by the positiue lawes of the land so as if it please the king he may appoint eights or more or lesse as well as they which if it were not so no minister were to meddle with the tenths of his parish for by god law tenths were brought to the storehouse of the ouerseers and distributed by them to the leuites according as euery man had neede but the leuites themselues neuer medled with the againe if tenths stood now by the law of god then the poore should haue euery third yeere all the tenths of the earth for so it was among the iewes while they stood in force by god law secondly they obiect that in the prouerbs chap it is a snare to deuoure tenths ans the place is to be vnderstood of tenths the standing in force by god law not of ours which stand by mans thirdly they alleage that some decrees were made in the primitiue church that the alienation of church lands should become sacriledge ans but those decrees concerned priuate persons who might not not may not on their owne heads impropriate the church goods as also they debarred the taking away of necessaries from the church for then the church was farre from that superfluitie which sithence it hath obtained so that for a lay man to hold lands impropriate the former conditions obserued is no sacriledge now if the question be concerning the impropriations of colledges whether they lawfully hold them or no then i answere secondly that i take it they hold them by a more speciall right for they being giuen at the first vnto the church they are not being impropriate to colledges generally and wholie alienated from the church but remaine in this speciall vse of the church for the maintaining of the seminaries of it without which the church must needs decay and this seemeth a sufficient cause of reseruing vnto them this maintenance so as ca e be had of the people and poore for their reliefe amp instruction secondly whereas the primitiue church first feasted and then receiued the lord supper wee note first the lawfulnes of feasts so as the poore be regarded superfluitie and riot auoided and the right end intended which is the praise and glorie of god expressed in thankfulnes for the abundance of his good blessings so after the sacrifices amp offrings aaron and the elders of israel came to feast with iethro before god exod so ezra goe your waies eate the fa and drinke the sweete and send part to them for whom none is prepared for this is the day of the lord secondly the papists are deceiued who teach it necessarie to come to the sacrament of the supper fasting for these feasted before it thirdly in the primitiue church and in the apostles daies there was no priuate masse in which one priest should eate vp all alone but there were feastings which cannot bee performed by one man alone but the whole congregation fourthly hence wee may note the end of the lord supper to be the increase of our fellowship amp communion with christian man as well as our vnion with god and that wee are to come together in loue and christian vnitie for the testifying of which charitable affection the ancient beleeuers in the apostles daies had these feasts of loue before they came to the lord table further in that these seducers are called spots in these feasts i note first that open offenders should be hindred and repelled from the sacraments being as spots in the face which because they are blemishes must bee washed away so ought these by the censure of excommunication to be vntill their repentance cut off from the face of the congregation secondly that euery one that professeth the faith is not a true member of the catholike church as the papists erroneously hold that let a man be what he will if he professe the faith it is sufficient to make him a member of the catholique church whereas open offenders are to be accounted as spottes which no man will say are true parts of the bodie but blemishes to bee pared away that their bodie may be the more perfect and entire feeding themselues without feare in feasting we are to preserue feare within our hearts which is two fold first of god secondly of man the former is seene exod the man of israel feasted before the lord iobes feare was lest his sonnes should cast this feare of god out of their hearts in their feasting and so offend god the latter is prescribed prou when thou fittest to meate before a ruler put the knife to thy throte that is bridle thine appetite haue respect not to passe the limits of sobrietie tempetance and moderation and as wee are to eate and drinke so also to season all other our actions with the feare of god and man which one grace would cut off many gracelesse practises euery where raigning amongst man but a speciall thing here aimed at is that we should neuer come to eate the lord supper without feare and reuerence which because the corinths wanted paul complaineth that one came hungrie another drunke and so prophaned that holy institution corinthian ob but in that place it seemeth paul condemneth these loue feasts which iude here dispraiseth not where hee saith euery man eateth his supper before verse ans these loue feasts were indifferent and might bee vsed or not paul condemneth the great abuse of them in corinthian because some were made by them drunke and vnfit for the lord supper and the rich deceiued the poore but iude commendeth them because they were in other churches rightly and religiously vsed clowdes they are without water carried about of windes these words containe the eighth and ninth sinnes of these wicked man which the better to know what they are let vs a little consider the meaning of them clowdes they are without water i pleaseth the spirit of god in many places of the old testament to compare prophets and teachers vnto clowdes and their doctrine vnto the dropping and distilling of the raine and sweet showers falling from these clowds so the prophet ezechiel is commaunded to set his face towards the way of teman and drop his word toward the south and his prophecie towards the forrest deut my doctrine shall drop as the raine and my speech shal distill as the dew as the shower vpon the herbes and as the great raine vpon the grasse mich and the word translated prophecie signifieth properly to drop or distill the reason of which comparison is rendred isai because as the raine falleth vpon the earth and returneth not in vaine but moistneth it and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may giue seed to the sower and bread to him that eateth so the word in the mouth of the ministers returneth not voide but accomplisheth the lord will and prospereth in the thing whereto it is sent in becomming the sauour of life to the saluation of some and of death vnto the death of them that perish the words then standing vpon this similitude beare this sense though the propertie and vse of clowdes is to carrie water and raine for the vse of the earth yet some clowdes are without water euen so though all teachers ought to bee filled and fitted with store of wholsome doctrine to powre it out for the vse of the church yet these seducers are vtterly destitute thereof and againe as those clowdes without water are light and fitter for nothing than to be carried about with euery winde so these are altogether variable and vnconstant carried about with euery blast of strange doctrine the former of these similitudes condemneth their sinne of barrennes and vnfruitfulnesse the latter their ninth sinne of inconstancie and variablenesse concerning the former seeing that the apostle taketh it for granted that the clowdes are naturally ordained to containe water it may be demanded how it can be coceiued that the clowds aboue being heauie with water should not fall to the earth seeing euery heauie thing naturally descendeth and tendeth downward ans the clowdes are heauie indeed for euen the windes themselues being by many degrees lighter than they haue their weight iob no man therefore by wit or reason can resolue this doubt but onely from the word of god which teacheth that it is by vertue of god commandement giuen in the creation that the clowdes fall not gen let the firmament separate the water from the water by force of which commanding word the water hangeth in the clowdes and the clowds in the ayre and need no other supporters iob setting out the maiestie and greatnes of god in his works here beginneth that he hangeth the earth vpon nothing he bindeth the water in the clowdes and the clowd is not broken vnder them philosophie is too defectiue to yeeld the true reason of this great worke of god which commonly attributeth too much to nature and too little to the god of nature whose prouidence and power is herein to be acknowledged in that by his word he ordereth all his creatures vnto which he speaketh the word and they obey secondly hence wee learne to conceiue the right meaning of that place gen let the firmament separate the water that be beneath from the water that be aboue by the firmament is meant the ayre or the distan betweene the earth and the starrie skie by the water vnder this firmament are meant the seas and floods and the water aboue are the watrie clowdes which are diuided by the firmament or ayre in which wee breathe called the firmament of heaue for it is the lowest of the three heauens which the scripture maketh mention of eaching to the starres the second being the sta ie heauen the third being the heauen of heauens the seate of god where hee reuealeth his glorie to his saints and angels those then are deceiued who out of this place dreame of a wat ie heauen aboue the starres now further in that these seducers are called clowds without water because they are destitute of wholesome doctrine wee learne first that ministers ought to bee such as are able to teach wholesome and sound doctrine tim malach the priests lips should preserue knowledge otherwise they are as clowdes without water keeping the field of god barren amp fruitlesse which abilitie supposeth yes and imposeth the performance of diligence herein or else whether they haue knowledge or not they come vnder the rank of them whom esay calleth dumbe dogs which cannot or doe not barke in former ages i grant indeede there were readers appointed in the church who could not otherwise teach but yet none were called for teachers into the church but such as had this abilitie of watring god church by doctrine more or lesse vntill heresie and schisme came in secondly ministers ought so to teach as they drop and instill the graces of faith repentance and obedience into the hearts of the hearers euen as the clowds drop water vpon the drie earth which sinketh into the same this was pauls desire to see the romanes that he might bestow some spirituall grace vpon them rom this is the right handling and diuiding of the word when man shew not words but power corinthian that teacher sheweth learning that sheweth man christ and can bee a meanes to distill god graces into their soules let this be the scope of those who are set apart vnto this holy ministrie else shall they be as vnprofitable as clowdes which containe no water in them at all thirdly if the ministers must be as clowdes hauing water in them then must the people be as drie ground not in regard of barrennes but of thirst and desire after these drops amp dewes of grace distilling from the ministerie psalm my soule desireth after thee euen as the thirstie land vnto which disposition wee are to preserue two things within vs first look as in drie land parcht with the heate of the sun there is a great want of moysture so in our soules must bee retained a sense of the want of the graces of god with an heartie sorrow for our want our hearts must bee perswaded that in vs and of our selues there is no good thing that god can take delight in yes and the griefe conceiued must not bee small but wee must feele our selues euen dried and parched with the heate of his wrath due vnto our sinnes vntill these sweete water flowing from vnder the threshold of the sanctuarie haue graciously refreshed vs mary saith that god filleth the hungrie with good things by the hungrie are meant those who feele themselues voide of grace yes as it were pined and starued for want of it christ telleth the woman of canaan that he came to the lost sheep of the house of israel that is hee that knoweth himselfe not a wadring sheep but quite lost euen in the lions paw ready to be deuoured such doth christ take vpon his necke and like a good shepheard bring backe to his fold for hee was sent to preach the acceptable yeere not to the mightie and states of he world but to prisoners and captiues that is such as could grieue and mourne for their captiuitie secondly as drie land parched with drought gapeth and openeth it selfe wide as if it would swallow vp the clowdes for raine so must our hearts preserue within them an earnest appetite and insatiable desire after christ and his merits aboue all the things in the world more hungring after him than after wealth gold siluer honours health or whatsoeuer is delightfull and highest prized among the sonnes of man and this will follow of the former for if wee bee once at the point that wee are out of all conceit of our owne goodnes we will seeke earnestly for it at the hands of him who is the fountaine of al goodnes if we feele our spirituall pouertie once we cannot but couetously hunt after those true treasures which onely inrich our soules to all eternitie the woman of samaria did but prattle with christ til he had told her of her sinne and of her husbands and that he which was now her husband was none of her then could she humble her selfe and confesse him to bee a prophet and quickly after came to acknowledge him the messiah and al her cauelling was laid aside so till we be humbled we doe but cauel at the word and receiue it not as drie land doth the showers which fall but let the heart once bee touched it is turned presently vpside down and we are become other manner of man than before the ninth sinne blamed in these seducers is that they are inconstant and vnstable carried like light clowds with the windes of strange doctrine whence teachers must learne to hold constantly the doctrine of saluation titus holding fast the faithfull word people also must not reuolt or depart from it nay not bee vnstable or soone remoued to another gospell ephesians be no more children wauering and carried aboue with euery wind of doctrine but both teachers and hearers must beware least we being by god blessing freed from the spiritual egypt where we were many hundred yeeres detained now after fourtie yeeres and moe looke backe again and fall from that faith into which we haue been baptised corrupt trees and without fruite twice dead and plucked vp by the roots in these words is the tenth sinne of these seducers set down and that is their incurable hypocrisie illustrated and amplified by a comparison or similitude from bad and barren trees containing foure steps or degrees of naughtines euery one worse than other the first step they are corrupt trees which must be vnderstood not in regard of their substance but in regard of their corrupt fruits for the word translated corrupt properly is applied to trees that beare no fruite but in the fall of the leafe which with the leaues fall off being neglected and wither away neuer comming to any good or gathering the second degree they are without fruite which words are a correction of the former for they are not onely without good fruite but vtterly destitute of any fruite at all thirdly they are twice dead that is certainly dead hopelesse of any fruite fourthly they are plucked vp by the roots that is vtterly without hope not of fruite but of life it selfe they are past liuing and much more past fruite this similitude then chargeth these seducers to whom it is fitly applied first that al their workes are but hypocriticall secondly that they are vtterly destitute of all good workes which truly are good thirdly that they haue no heauely and spirituall life or sappe in them and fourthly that they are out of christ not rooted in him but plucked vp and therfore they are most hopelesse of euer bearing fruite vnto life being proceeded so farre in the high way vnto perdition so much of the meaning doct in that these false teachers are iustly condemned for this sinne of being corrupt trees without fruite wee on the contrarie must striue to become good trees of god delight isai iudah is the plant of my delight trees of righteousnes isai the plant of the lord laden with the fruites of righteousnesse which that we may be foure things are required of vs first that we be well rooted secondly that wee liue in the roote thirdly that wee beare fruite fourthly that wee beare good fruite first we must be rooted in this rooting two things are required first there must bee a roote this roote is christ ioh he is the vine wee the branches rom if wee bee planted into him column rooted in him here wee must consider christ not as god alone or man alone or the son of god alone but as god man as god made man as an immanuel god with vs euen our mediatour and redeemer thus he is our roote in whom are hid the treasures of graces column and of whose fulnes we all receiue grace for grace ioh the second thing in this rooting is ingrafting for trees of righteousnesse grow not by nature psalm a good man is as a tree planted for by nature the best man are but wilde oliues and must be transplanted from the first adam into the second the author of this ingrafting is god himselfe who doth it by two actions first he giueth christ truly and really in the word and sacraments not out of the word but in and by it so corinthian paul planteth apollo watereth that is god by their ministrie ingrafted the corinthians into christ secondly when on his part hee giueth christ hee giueth also a power to the beleeuer to apprehend him and receiue him with his merits vnto saluation and that by the only hand of faith ob but this can bee no ingrafting seeing christ is in heauen we are on earth ans it is not indeede a naturall ingrafting which cannot be but by the fit applying of two body one to the other but spirituall yet as sure and as straight as that is we see in nature the minde is present and ioyned with the thing it thinketh of although it be distant many thousand miles if this can bee true in nature then much more in faith which is a worke supernaturall and far aboue the reach of nature againe a man hath land giuen him in spaine turkey or america many thousand miles off him he was neuer at it he neuer saw it and yet is truly the lord of it and may say of it it is his owne by vertue of the donation euen so god in his word giueth christ and his merits to the beleeuer who as he hath receiued him by faith so he retaineth him by grace by vertue of which donation and acceptation a man may as truly say christ is his as though he were now in heauen alreadie with him yes so firme and certaine is this ingrafting that it once being made can neuer be dissolued but is euerlasting for the root liuing and abiding for euer so also doe the branches being set into the same and that by the hand of the good husbandman god himselfe the second thing required in a tree of righteousnes is life which is not the naturall life of other plants but spirituall and eternall for eternall life beginneth euen in this life galath now i liue yet not i now but christ liueth in me and this life is by the faith in the son of god and then wrought in vs when the same minde which was in christ whilest hee was vpon earth is also in vs philip for hee conueyeth his owne disposition into his members in part who are daily made conformable vnto him of which conformitie the apostle maketh two parts rom first a conformitie vnto him in his death that looke as he died for sinne so ought his members vnto sin and as he by his death subdued sinne and obtained victorie ouer it so ought they daily to be nibling in the abolishing and mortifying of that sinne which presseth them downe and hangeth so fast vpon them vntill the day of their full conquest and finall deliuerance secondly a conformitie vnto him in his resurrection that as he rose againe from the graue so should they from the graue of their sinnes and as hee rose to liue for euer so ought they by vertue of his resurrection to liue to god in newnes of life as those that looke to liue foreuer with him thirdly the tree of righteousnesse must bring foorth fruites to testifie the life of it called galath fruites of the spirit and there reckoned vp loue peace ioy long suffering gentlenes goodnes faith meekenes temperance philipp paul prayeth that the philippians might be filled with the fruites of righteousnes that is the duties of the morall law contained in the first and second table fourthly a tree of righteousnes must bring foorth good fruites such as are pleasing vnto god quest how shall a christian bring forth good fruits ans first good fruit must come from a good heart an heart penitent and truly turned to god mat bring foorth fruites worthie amendement of life timot loue out of a pure heart secondly it must be brought forth with intention will purpose and endeuour to obey god in his commandements which the heart must respect thirdly the end of this fruite must be the glorie of god not seeking our selues but god honour in leuit god requireth that the trees should bee circumcised which was thus performed the three first yeeres the fruite was to be cast or fall away the fourth it was to bee dedicated to the lord and the fifth yeere the israelites might eate of the fruite euen so wee must first cast away in respect of our selues our fruites and dedicate them vnto the lord so he shall taste of them with delight and not before fourthly it must bee brought foorth to the good of others as trees beare fruites not for themselues but for man so our fruites must bee intended not so much for our priuate good as the common good of the church and common wealth doct seeing the faithfull are not such corrupt trees but of god owne plant they haue here first a ground of comfort in the middest of sorrow sicknes yes and death it selfe for being ingrafted into christ the whole man is preserued safe amp found in him yes the dying bodie nay the dead bodie and that which is rotting in the graue is planted into him and is to liue againe in him who alwaies liueth and will raise it to life eternall at the last day trees in winter are dead to mans sense yet because the rootes of them liue and haue in them sappe and moysture in the spring they shall bud blossome and beare fruite againe euen so the rotten body at the time of refreshing shall reuiue againe and become a glorious plant putting off mortalitie and corruption no more to be subiected thereunto againe than the roote into which they are set who hath for his members chased them away secondly seeing we must be planted and cannot attaine this growth by nature we must detest and abhorre our selues in dust and ashes renounce and bewaile our naturall condition and be at no rest till wee feele our selues set into christ by liuing the life of the son of god for know we not that christ liueth in vs except we be reprobates thirdly our church hath herein resembled iudah hauing been for many yeres a plant of god delight who hath hedged and fenced it by his fauourable protection but many yes the most branches are barren bearing no fruite others beare lesse fruite than they haue done being withered and fallen back what will be thinke we the end hereof surely the axe being alreadie laid to the roote of the tree shall cut downe whatsoeuer branches beare not foorth good fruite and they shall be cast into the fire it standeth vs then in hand to become more fruitfull before we be cut downe fourthly hence let euery man learne subiection vnto god in all his crosses and afflictions wee are trees or branches at least of the vine the father is the husbandman and looke a the husbandman loppeth cutteth pruneth yes and almost cutteth downe his trees to make them more fruitfull so dealeth the lord with his children who therein are to rest well contented for he chasteneth them for their good that although no chastisement seemeth ioyous for the present yet it bringeth afterward the pleasant fruite of righteousnes to those that are exercised thereby twice dead and plucked vp some hence gather this that wee are once dead in adam by originall sinne and secondly after regeneration or ingrafting into christ by some grieuous sinne wounding the conscience to death and hence conclude that a man regenerate may die againe and fall from grace vrging for their purpose that in rom through vnbeleefe they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high minded but feare but this cannot be so vnderstood for by twice dead is meant dead certainly or dead twice once in adam by originall sinne and the second time dead by their owne actuall sinne as for that place in rom i answere there are two kindes of plant first outward secondly inward the outward is when god giueth the word vnto a people with other his ordinances and they publikely professe it the inward is when god giueth true faith whereby man are set into christ now the iewes whom the apostle speaketh of were implanted by the former onely and therefore might be broken off the other is euerlasting ioh they went out from vs but were not of vs for if they had been of vs they should haue continued with vs further where it is said plucked vp hence is gathered by some that they were once in the roote and therefore a man rooted and set in christ may perish finally ans but we must know that this phrase in the scripture signifieth a manifestation of the things to be done rather than the doing of them they are therfore said to bee plucked vp whom god manifesteth neuer to haue been rooted as also man are said to be blotted out of the booke of life not that they were euer written therein but in that god manifesteth and maketh knowne to man that they were neuer written in it the apostle in this verse proceedeth on in the further discouerie of these wicked man by sundry other sins set downe after the same manner as the former by way of similitude and comparison and first he compareth them to the raging waues of the sea and secondly to wandring starres and in the end of the verse for whom ampc the conclusion is againe repeated of which we haue spoken in the verse the former comparison hath three expositions for some will haue their grosse hypocrisie hereby signified and then the comparison standeth vs looke as the waues of the sea rage and swell rising vp towards the heauens as though they would swallow and ouerflow the earth which they seeme to threate but drawing to the shore they are broken to a little foame so these seducers make a great shew of godlinesse and pietie as though they onely would goe to heauen yet is the matter nothing so all is but froth seeing they want the power and practise of religion and godlines in the middest of such pretenses secondly others hereby expresse their vnprofitablenes and deceitfulnes in their doctrine thus as the waues of the sea rise very huge and high especially being stirred by the windes and yet their effect is nothing but a little foame and mire which they cast vp so these lewd man being puffed vp in themselues promise great matters to their followers as much libertie many blessings and great good things and yet the effect of all their shewes is but to make man much more the servant of sinne than before and thus peter speaketh of them in speaking swelling words of vanitie they beguile with wantonnes through the lusts of the flesh them which were cleane escaped from them this was truly spoken of them and may as truly be applied vnto diverse of our times as first the libertines and familists fondly assuring their disciples that they shall bee illuminate and deified such great matters they promise whereas they make them the children of the diuell seuen fold more than they were before secondly the roman clergie haue been as large in their promises vnto their hearers teaching them that they shall be able to satisfie the iustice of god for their sinnes yes and merit life euerlasting and that many of them can performe works of supererrogation which the law of god bindeth them not vnto but what is this but to foame out dirt and mire and to teach man that for a little money they may breake al god commandements the third exposition is this as the sea stirred by the windes and weather rageth and from the foundation casteth vp nothing but froth so these man stirred and mooued by the hand of god correcting them amend not nor profit thereby but rather vnder the same discouer the wickednes and vnbeliefe of their hearts which is the most agreeable and fittest exposition explained in isai the wicked are like the raging sea that cannot rest whose water cast vp mire and dirt from this sense consider these two things first a worke of god secondly a practise of man first the wil work and appointment of god is that man shall be troubled stirred mooued and set out of quiet and haue within them such disquietnes as if the raging waues of the sea were within their soules the minds of man both godly and wicked their willes and affections are often so distempered as is the sea whe it is troubled with boisterous windes and tempests iere the lord shall trouble damascus so she shall become as a fearfull sea that cannot rest iosh ioshua said to achan thou hast troubled israel and the lord shall trouble thee iob saith the almightie troubled him chap yes christ himselfe although hee was without sinne had his soule troubled in his agonie in which his minde will and affections were disturbed and this trouble god bringeth on man diverse waies sometimes by those of a mans owne house as iacobs sonnes troubled him genes sometimes they of his company as achan iosh somtimes by the lord withdrawing of himselfe psalm thou diddest hide thy face and i was troubled sometimes a mans own heart and conscience will rage against him as baltazar seeing the hand writing vpon the wall was troubled and there was no life in him daniel what then wil some say is there no difference betweene the godly and the wicked herein ans yes for euery little crosse vnto the wicked is a tempest breaking the rockes which maketh them to storme and rage and send foorth foame and mire but the crosses of the godly are as calme windes a little shaking them indeed amp for a little time but are blowne ouer when they haue a little exercised their faith and graces so as they are bettered yes and furthered by them king elijah standing on mount horeb there passed by him a mightie tempest which rent the rocks and then an earthquake then fire but god was not in any of these afterward there came a still and soft voyce and god was in the voyce afflictions are like that tempest earthquake and fire namely to the wicked against whom the lord commeth to shake and consume them but to the godly are as a still voyce to teach and instruct them vnder which they quietly content theselues because god is in that still voice namely by his grace and presence supporting and sustaining them euen in the middest of their troubles secondly the practise of a wicked man is when hee is troubled and stirred by god to foame out his owne shame euen as the sea his froth experience teacheth that if a wicked man haue any wrong or disgrace offered him presently he discouereth the corruption of his heart and breaketh out into railing cursing reuiling and all manner of reuenge so if god hand bee vpon him by sicknes or vpon his familie he cannot couer his want of loue of god he cannot hide the infidelitie of his heart for hee betakes himselfe the next way to the sorcerer figure caster or the next wizard so flieth from god as fast as his feete will carrie him and euery way the same violent affections bewray themselues which these seducers are charged withall vse seeing this is the propertie of a wicked man being troubled to foame out his owne shame let the childe of god in his trouble quiet himselfe restraine and bridle his corruptions yes let him shew foorth his faith obedience meeknes and subiection vnto god let him repaire vnto god by prayer as iehosaphat being in a great streight on euery side turned his eyes vnto the lord saying i know not what to doe but our eye are towards thee and dauid from absalom his son reuiled him not nor tormed against him but turned to the lord saying if i please thee not lord here am i doe with me at thou pleasest the second comparison followeth in these words they are wandring s ars by which words wee may not vnderstand the planets in the heauens neither the fixed starres which keepe a direct and constant course but such as wee call shooting falling or gliding starres which haue some light but it is soone obscured the sinne then is that which was before mentioned namely their false and instable doctrine which can neuer direct man to heaue no more than these shooting starres can direct either sailers by sea or trauellers by land hence learne two things first that all true teachers must be starres secondly they must bee fixed and not wandring starres first they must bee starre ob this cannot be seeing they haue no light of their owne ans christ is the light which inlighteneth euery man that commeth into the world called therefore the sun of righteousnes and the day starre from whom all ministers receiue their light againe they may bee fit instruments to carrie light vnto others which is their office although they haue none of their own saue that onely which is conueied from christ vnto them as a lanthorne hath no light in it selfe but what man put into it doct first all true teachers must first haue the sun of righteousnes to shine in their owne hearts before they can enlighten others with his light for as paul was himselfe comforted that he might be able to comfort others corinthian so no man can teach others till himselfe first bee taught secondly if they be starres they must shine to somwhat and that is to the hearts of man so as the principall care of ministers ought to bee herein placed that they may enlighten the minds consciences wils and affections of man so becomming the meanes of the rising of the sun of righteousnes in mens hearts not that they may fill the care with words but the heart with light comfort and refreshing this was the scope of pauls preaching corinthian in the declaration of the truth to approoue himselfe to euery mans conscience in the sight of god so as if his gospell were yet hid it was not his fault but of those man whose eyes the god of the world had blinded that the light of the glorious gospel of christ should not shine vnto their hearts vse this teacheth that all man by nature are the children of darknesse without the knowledge of god as vnto who god hath appointed teachers to be as shining stars to enlighte them we neede not to go farre to proue this truth for euen our owne countrey witnesseth that in the daies of former princes our forefathers wanting this light and these stars sowed and reaped their fields brought home their corne baked their bread which serued them partly for foode and partly to make a breaden god of a more palpable darknes than that of egypt which might haue been felt secondly seeing that darknes is chased away and wee haue the light and many bright starres to direct vs take the exhortation ephesian ye are now light walk as children of light namely by accepting entertaining and embracing of the light that wee may doe this first wee must know the light and behold it with the loue and affection of our hearts vnto it that as when the sun shineth euery man openeth his doores and windowes to receiue the comfort of it so wee should open the doores of our hearts to entertaine and retaine the light of christ to haue them filled therewith for then god fauourable countenance is shining vpon vs secondly hauing the light we must doe the workes of the light that is of obedience when the sun is vp and shineth euery man walketh in his calling and whilest our sun of grace is ouer our heads wee are to walke as becommeth the calling of christianitie to make conscience of all sinne a shame is it at noon day to stumble amp fall and rush into a pit so now is it for christian man in such a sun shine of the gospell to betake them to euery worke of darknes and be betaken with euery snare of sin as though they had no light to direct them but were left in darknes secondly true teachers must not onely be starres but fixed starres that is constant amp stable in the doctrine which they teach and deliuer out of the prophets and apostles for if the starres and sea markes should chaunge their places and remoue to amp fro the poore passengers that looke for constant direction from them are likely to be carried and cast vpon quicke sands and rockes and so bee ouerthrowne and drowned in like manner if teachers bee variable and changelings in their doctrines the soules of their hearers not knowing where to haue sure direction are as likely to suffer shipwracke and sinke into the pit of hell vse people ought to haue their hearts stablished and setled vpon the doctrine of religion taught and proued vnto them out of the word by the direction whereof they are to bee passed vnto the hauen of happines if this bee learned of the bodie of this land our peace and prosperitie shall be stable within our walles and palaces ye god protection shall be a wall of fire round about vs so much of that verse the apostle hauing in the latter part of the former verse repeated the conclusion of the reason which is that these seducers shall be destroyed the blacknes of darknes being reserued for them hee confirmeth that conclusion by a worthie testimonie of enoch who prophecied that the lord would giue iudgement against all vngodlie man and therefore these vngodly man verse must needes be destroyed in this testimonie consider two things first the preface before it secondly the testimonie it selfe in the preface he nameth the author who was enoch and commendeth him in that he was the seuenth from adam here two questions are to bee answered first whence had iude this historie seeing it is no where recorded in the scriptures and how knew he it to be enochs i answere two waies first he either had it and learned it to bee his by some tradition which went from hand to hand or else written by some iew or secondly he learned it out of some booke which went vnder enochs name then extant in the daies of the apostles though now lost it is certaine that one of these waies hee had it hence the papists gather that the iewes had vnwritten traditions and consequently all their traditions are to be obserued ans we denie not all vnwritten traditions of which some are true and profitable but wee renounce and denie all those traditions which are made articles of faith amp rules of god worship necessarie to saluation for all such doctrines are written in the books of the prophets and apostles which containe perfect direction and rules concerning faith amp manners of which kind the romane church holdeth their traditions to be this is of another kind it being no article of faith nor necessary to saluation to knowe whether enoch writ this prophecie or no againe from the second answere others who are no papists conclude that some bookes of canonicall scripture are perished and lost but this is vntrue for then first the fidelitie of the church which is the keeper of these oracles should be called in question and secondly in the bookes canonicall extant not one sentence or tittle no not the sense of any sentence is lost how then should whole bookes come to be lost it is alleaged that the books of salomon are most of them lost answer the bookes of salomon which were lost were bookes of humanitie and philosophie for hee writ of all beast birds trees euen from the cedar in libanus to the hyssop vpon the wall the books of humane truth might faile but no part of canonicall scripture ob mention is made in the scripture of the bookes of the chronicles of the iewes or kings of iudah but these are perished ans they were politic history as are the chronicles of england or other country ob the bookes of nathan gad idd shemaiah and other prophets are perished ans all these as is though by the learned are contained in the bookes of the kings chronicles and samuel ob this book of enoch is lost ans first it is doubted whether it was a booke or no or went by a tradition secondly if it was a booke it was no part of scripture for moses was the first penman of scripture who liued long after enoch the second question why doth the apostle make choise of this testimonie of enoch rather than some other prophet answer himselfe giueth two reasons first he was the seuenth from adam it is therefore an ancient testimonie to be receiued and reuerenced for the antiquitie but withall it sheweth what is true antiquitie namely when a doctrine of religion can bee prooued from some prophet or apostle for this testimonie was a prophecie and therefore that antiquitie which the church of rome challengeth to her religion and doctrine is but counterfeit because they are not able to iustifie the maine pointes thereof from any prophet or apostle yes in these wherein they dissent from vs they cannot bring their proofe and descent from within the first hundred yeeres after christ it is then a vaine plea and false pretence of them to boast of the antiquitie of their religion the second reason is in the word prophecied for enoch spoke not this of his owne head or motion but from god for no creature angell or man can foretell things to come it being a prerogatiue properly belonging vnto god ob yes but the learned physition can truely foretell the death of the patient to come ans he doth not properly herein foretell a thing to come for the death of the partie is present in the signes and causes of it ob but the diuell could foretell sauls death sam to morow shalt thou be with me and thy sonnes ans the diuell could not properly foretell it but might see it in the causes and signes againe hee might speake so to saule because god had made him an instrument for the execution of that iudgement and destruction so as god only properly foretelleth that which is simply to come and no man or angell the second point is the testimonie it selfe behold the lord commeth ampc in which obserue three points first the comming of the lord secondly the iudgement of the lord thirdly the cause of it in the verse to giue iudgement against al man ampc first of the party comming behold the lord commeth where the apostle speaketh in the time present which is put for the time to come which forme of speech sheweth the certaintie of christs comming to iudgement who shall as certeinly come as if he were now alreadie comming concerning which certaintie it may be demaunded first whence commeth this comming of christ to be so certaine ans from the vnchangeable will of god which hath certainly decreed the same for he hath appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnes and thus are all other the articles of our faith most certaine in that they are grounded on the vnchangeable will and word of god secondly how or from whence may we know this will of god to be so certaine ans from the manner of propounding the doctrine of it wherein the euidence of the spirit plainly appeareth saying peremptorily the lord commeth euidently expressing the certaintie as if it were now present and the same may be spoken of the whole scripture which in it selfe is most sure and certain because it is the most vnchangeable will of god but how do we know it so to be will some say i answere by the euidence of the spirit the authoritie puritie maiestie effect and ends of the doctrine it neede not seeke euidence elsewhere than from it selfe not from man or the church it selfe the roman church confesseth it is of it selfe and in it selfe sufficiently certaine but not to me or thee except the church say so but this is a false position the scripture is certaine both in it selfe and vnto vs and we know it so to be though neuer a man would acknowledge it the heart seasoned with grace will make the mouth confesse it secondly the apostle speaking in this forme he commeth for he will come wee learne to set before our eyes the comming of the lord iesus to iudgement and to make account of euery present day as the day of his comming the scriptures euery where commend watchfulnes vnto vs which is to do nothing else but to make reckoning continually of this day but some will say we cannot make account daily of it for we see it commeth not neither may we enquire into the time of it answer although wee cannot exactly make account of that daye of generall iudgement yet may we well reckon vpon the day of our particular iudgement and the day of our owne death that so wee may be fitted thereto for as this shall leaue vs so that shall finde vs a necessarie doctrine and dutie to be enforced in these drowsie daies wherein euery man almost putteth off the euill day and maketh league and couenants with death and hell the young man presumeth of length of daies the olde man dreameth he may liue one yeere longer both of them deferre hereupon their repentance in that they both are of one minde namely that their master will yet deferre his comming thirdly we must not only carrie within vs a conceit and opinion of this day but also must be inwardly affected with it that we may walke in awe and reuerence before god in regard of it corinthian knowing therefore the terror of the lord we perswade man ampc now in the latter part of this verse the attendants of the lord in his comming are mentioned in these words with thousands of his saints which must be vnderstood not only of angels but man also thess at the comming of the lord iesus christ with all his saints qu how can this be and how shall the saints come with him ans all man shall rise with their owne body good amp bad at the sound of the trumpet then shall the saints be taken vp into the clowdes to meete christ and shall be made a part of his attendance but the wicked shal stand vpo the earth wishing the mountaines and hils to fall vpon them and hide them from the presence of the iudge which affoordeth a most speciall comfort vnto all them who know themselues to be the members of christ they shall not need to be dismaied at that day nor feare the face of the wicked seeing they shall be receiued in the clowdes into fellowship with christ before the iudgement begin which manner of proceeding the apostle hauing described concludeth with the same wherefore comfort your selues one another with these wordes verse here also may bee noted the power maiestie and omnipotencie of christ in his second comming although his first comming was base and in the forme of a servant now he shall come with many millions of angels and saints whom all creatures cannot resist let no wicked man thinke then either to absent himselfe or escape his fearefull wrath the only way to auoide it is in thy life time to meete him by repentance the second point in the testimonie is the iudgement of the lorde which together with the cause is in this verse described concerning the iudgement wee must knowe that it is either generall or speciall both of them here mentioned the former in these wordes to giue iudgement against all man the latter in these words following and to rebuke all the vngodly among them in the generall iudgement it may be asked how christ can bee said to giue iudgement against all man seeing the saints shall come with him and hee will passe no sentence against them ans the meaning is he will giue iudgement vpon all man for the godly shall receiue and heare a sentence but of absolution and amongst all man he will rebuke the vngodly all persons shall come vnto iudgement without exception of what age sexe or state soeuer they be this vniuersall iudgement teacheth vs first to redresse before this day come whatsoeuer within vs would when it commeth confound vs for euery man must appeare in his owne person no procter shall be allowed to speake or solicite for any man the secrets of all hearts must bee disclosed and euery man shall receiue accordingly to that he hath done it standeth man therefore in hand to reforme things amisse before hand for they shall appeare nakedly euen as they are quest how shall this bee done ans corinthian iudge thy selfe before hand and thou shalt not bee iudged of the lord arraigne examine cast and condemne thy selfe sue for pardon as for life and death and thou shalt escape that fearefull iudgement for hee that confesseth his sinnes and forsaketh them shall finde mercie prou thus doe and mercie belongeth vnto thee vpon the same ground paul raiseth the same dutie admonishing all man euery where to repent because he hath appointed a day in which hee will iudge the worlde in righteousnes act secondly seeing there is a day of vniuersall iudgment seeke in the meane time to stop the mouth of thy conscience that it may then stand with thee to excuse and acquite thee and neuer dare to offend againe and wound it for it is a deputy iudge vnder god which if it condemne thee much more shall god the great iudge being greater than thy conscience thirdly hence in all actions our care should be to approoue our hearts vnto god especially in hearing and speaking the word prayer vse of the sacraments yes and all our endeuours should be to please and obey him who one day will giue an vpright sentence vpon them all thus the consideration of the iudgement to come made the apostle paul endeuour to approoue all the actions of his life vnto god corinthian so peter epistle seeing all these things shall be dissolued what manner of man ought we to be in holy conuersation and godlines looking for the hasting vnto the comming of the day of the lord the speciall iudgement is laid down in the next words and they containe two things first the persons who shall be iudged all the vngodly among them secondly the manner of their iudgement in the word rebuke or conuince the persons are set out by their propertie of vngodlinesse which is a sinne directly against god and the vngodly man is he who denieth god the honour due vnto him of whom that we might the better know him the scripture hath giuen fiue notes or properties as first that he knoweth not or acknowledgeth not the true god aright according to his word psalm all their thoughts be that there is no god that is they acknowledge him not in his presence prouidence iustice or mercie secondly he subiecteth not his body soule and conscience to the laws of god in al things but taketh libertie to liue as hee list iob they say to the almightie depart from vs we will none of thy waies psalm they hate to be reformed thirdly in heart and life he dependeth not himselfe vpon the will power prouidence and good pleasure of god but on something out of god in himself or some other creature abac whereas the iust man liueth by faith the wicked man exalteth himselfe and is puffed vp as bearing himself vpon something besides the creator fourthly he worshippeth not from his heart the true god he lifteth not vp his soule in prayer or thanksgiuing but as a beast receiueth blessings contenting himselfe within himselfe neuer looking higher to the hand reaching them out vnto him iob who is the almightie that wee should serue him and what profit is it to call vpon him psalm he neuer calleth vpon god fifthly he hateth the church and people of god and when occasion shall serue he will testifie it by persecuting the same for he that loueth not god loueth not his adherents psalm they smite downe thy people o lord and trouble thine heritage these be the notes of them against whom sentence shall passe when they shall be iudged from whence two duties are to be learned first to denie all vngodlines and to put farre from vs all the properties thereof secondly to exercise our selues vnto godlines and all the duties therof as first to learne to know god aright both in his owne attributes and also in his affection to vs ward neuer quieting our selues till wee know him to be our father our redeemer our sanctifier and this knowledge of him is life eternall secondly to subiect our selues our liues wils affections speeches and actions to all his lawes for to shake off the yoke of obedience to any part of his word is rebellion thirdly to goe out of our selues as being nothing in our selues and in our hearts depend vpon the will and good pleasure of god liuing by faith making him our rocke our tower our fortresse and strong defence in all estates yes in life and in death our aduantage fourthly to worship him not only outwardly as hypocrites may doe but to serue him in our spirits giuing him our whole hearts fifthly to loue all man but especially god saints and the householde of faith affecting the particular congregations and chiefly delighting in the saints vpon earth that excell in vertue thus walking with god as enoch did we shall escape this most wofull sentence which shall bee pronounced against the vngodly ones of the earth the second thing in this special iudgment is the manner of it in the word rebuke god rebuketh two waies first in mercie when as in iustice he remebreth mercie hab secondly in iustice yes in anger and wrath psalm o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath and this latter is here meant so as thus much is here signified that the lord will powre out his fury and his wrathful indignation vpon al the vngodly of the earth this wrathful rebuke hath two parts first the conuicting of the vngodly in their own cosciences of all their wicked thoughts words and works and this the word also signifieth reu the books shal be opened and all mens sinnes shall be laid open that is they shall be so discouered as they being conuinced shall not be able to denie them secondly the punishment that shall follow that conuiction so dauid prayeth psalm neither chastice me in thy heauie displeasure doct hence we learne that al things are fully and perfectly knowne vnto god and all things are open before him heb yes they are naked and as it were vnquartered before his eyes for the apostle alludeth to the cutting vp of a beast or the anatomizing of the creature wherein man are curious to finde out euery little veine or muskle though they lie neuer so close euen so the lord shall finde out euery transgression although neuer so secretly conceiued and concealed and that in such sort as hee shall conuince the vngodly man whose mouth shall be shut so soone as euer his booke is open which should teach vs first in matter of religion to auoide all dissembling and hypocrisie be that in deede what thou seemest to be for though thou maiest delude man thou canst not deceiue the almightie but hee shall conuince thee secondly let thy dealing before man be plaine simple without fraud couin or deceit for though thou maist glose with man who cannot conuince thee yet the righteous lord shall rebuke thee for want of righteousnes in thy dealings thirdly humble thy selfe before god alwaies for all thy knowne sinnes yes and for thy vnknowne sinnes also for though they be vnknowne to thy selfe yet they are knowne vnto him who will one day conuince thee of them all except thou preuent him by thy repentance the third thing propounded in the testimonie is the cause of the iudgement in these words of all their wicked deeds which they haue vngodlily comitted and of all their cruell speakings which wicked sinners haue spoken against him the cause is two fold the deedes and words of man the deedes are distributed first by the propertie of them being workes of vngodlines secondly by the manner of performing them they are vngodlily comitted by vngodly works are meant all sinnes against any part of the law of god whether in the first or second table for euery sinne though it be directly against man hath in it a defect and withdrawing of some dutie due to god secondly for the manner these workes being vngodly and failing against the law are done after an vngodly manner and that worke is done vngodlily which proceedeth from an vnrepentant heart and a minde addicted and deuoted to vngodlines which is knowne and discerned to be such a one by three notes first because it purposeth to commit sinne before hand secondly in the committing of sinne it is delighted and taketh pleasure in it thirdly after sin it walketh in the same course yes runneth on in the same waies without remorse or repentance and this clause seemeth to be added to put a difference between the godly and wicked who both of them may commit vngodlines and be found in vngodly actions but not both committing them in an vngodly manner for the childe of god before he sinne hee purposeth it not yes he hath a purpose not to sinne so as he may say it is not only besid but against his purpose secondly in his sinne he hath a resisting and strife against it and is not wholy swallowed vp in the pleasure of it thirdly he lieth not in it but reneweth and recouereth himselfe againe by faith and repentance so as though hee doe wickednes yet hee doth it not wickedly but weakely being ouercome and foyled by corruption and hence is it that this wicked worke being found in the hands of god children though it deserue death yet through grace it shall be no cause of his condemnation doct the principall cause of condemnation is not this or that sinne but the lying and trade therein which argueth an vngodly heart to commit vngodlines indeede maketh man subiect to condemnation but to commit it vngodlily this bringeth swift iudgement secondly a wicked man sinneth not of infirmitie for he committeth vngodlines in an vngodly manner and tradeth in wickednes wickedly the sinnes of infirmitie befall not the gracelesse sinner but the regenerate only in whom frailty faileth grace for a time the drunkard may excuse himselfe and say his sinne is his infirmitie yet is it not but a wickednes wickedly committed so of the couetous person and other sinners thirdly marke god great mercy with much thankfulnes in that the regenerate doing wicked actions aswell as the wicked are not condemned for them as the wicked are for there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus rom the second cause of the iudgement is the speeches of the wicked set out by two properties first they are cruell secondly they are vttered against god an example of such speech we haue in lamech genes whosoeuer killeth caine shall be reuenged seuen fold but whosoeuer offendeth me i wil reuenge my selfe seuentie times seuen fold a cruell and bloodie speech vanting it selfe euen against god himselfe vse first hence it followeth that wicked words and works are causes of lust condemnation ob then good words and workes are causes of saluation ans the reason is not good for wicked mens sins be perfectly wicked but the actions of the regenerate are not perfectly good secondly we are hence to bewaile the vngodly words and workes that haue passed vs which binde vs ouer to condemnation and aboue all things in the world to sue to god by prayer for pardon yes to giue our selues no rest till we haue within vs the witnes of god spirit witnessing to our spirits that we are graciously accepted and that our vngodly workes are remoued out of his sight thirdly wee are to marke those persons whose liues and mouthes abound with vngodlines and communicate not with such but mourne for them as lot did whose righteous soule was vexed not onely in seeing the wicked workes but also in hearing the filthy speeches of the vncleane sodomites my teares saith dauid haue bin my meate day and night while they daily say vnto me where is thy god fourthly our dutie is to auoide euery wicked way and word and endeuour to haue our speech seasoned with salt and ministring grace to the hearers fifthly consider hence what we in this land may iustly be afraid of seeing vngodlines so exceedingly aboundeth godlines decreaseth the godly are taken away the wicked reproch those that are left euen for religions sake and for such religious practises as stand both by god law and the lawes of the land by such speeches as these thou article one that runnes to sermons doest thou learne this and that there thou article full of the holie ghost the diuell is within thee and such like most wretched and vngodly speeches iustly deseruing fearefull iudgements the wickednes of inhabitant ouerturne whole kingdomes prou it behoues vs then to betake our selues to speedie repentance lest speedie vengeance ouertake vs vnawares in this verse the apostle returneth againe to his former purpose and still continueth the rehearsall of the sinnes and vices of these false teachers against whom he writeth and against whom he hath alreadie alleaged twelue seuerall sinnes and in this verse addeth sixe more of which some notwithstanding haue been touched in the sins formerly condened herein we will first shew the nature of the vices themselues and secondly lay downe the contrarie duties so farre as they shall concerne vs these are murmurers by murmuring wee are to vnderstand a certaine fruite of impatience whereby man shew themselues displeased with the worke of god prouidence especially when his hand is vpon them and they are vnder the crosse example whereof wee haue in the israelites who when moses had brought them out of egypt they murmured and repined that they were fed with manna only and wanted their flesh pots which they had in egypt see deut where this sinne is called rebellion against god and therefore is no small sinne for the auoyding and preuenting of which sinne wee must learne two duties first in silence and subiection to calme and quiet our harts in the reueiled will of god vpon vs though therein our owne willes bee crossed psalm examine your selues and be still psalm be silent vnto god and waite on the lord which is al one as if he had plainly said let god will be your will also isai in quietnes and confidence shall be your strength herein our strength must be exercised not in resisting but enduring the hand of god secondly wee must shew our selues truly thankfull to god in all things befalling vs yes euen in euill things which otherwise may be occasions of murmuring iob the lord hath giuen and the lord hath taken blessed be his name ob but this may seeme harsh and contrary to reason to blesse god for crosses ans not a whit if we conceiue that according to our deserts he might plunge vs into the pit of hell and therefore if he mitigate of that iustice and remember his mercie more easily correcting vs herein all the praise of mercie is due vnto him complainers so called for two causes first because they are discontented with their present outward estate wherin god hath placed them the portion that god hath allotted the liketh them not they are displeased that they are not as others be and that they haue not as others haue secondly because vpon the frowardnes of their dispositio they are easily displeased and hard to please again soone incensed and not so soone satisfied and thereupon are commonly complaining of the hard measure they seeme to receiue at mens hands but especially they are so called in respect of the former reason this is not the sinne of that age onely neither only of those persons but is euen a common sinne of our times and that of the richer sort for these are the poorest amongst man euer whining and complaining that their state is not so good as others nor as they would haue it and although they know as we say no end of their wealth yet know they no end of their wishings and desires we on the contrarie are hence to learne first to thinke well and speake well of that estate in which god in his prouidence hath setled vs bee it better or worse philipp in what estate soeuer i haue learned therewith to be contented heb be content with that you haue first carrie not couetous aspiring and malicious mindes and affections but if thou must needes bee desiring satisfie thy selfe with iacobs desire onely the lord be with me and if hee giue me foode and raiment in this my iourney it is sufficient secondly our hearts must be set to obey god euen in pouertie and affliction and beare aduersitie with an equall and moderate minde our obedience must not onely be actiue in doing but passiue also in suffering his wil philipp i can want and abound i can doe all things through christ that strengtheneth me hebr the faithfull could with ioy suffer the spoyling of their goods thirdly wee must endeuour to shew all meekenes to all man vpon all occasions putting off all morositie waiwardnes and difficultie to bee satisfied and appeased christs voyce was not life vp in the streetes he endured all wrongs forgaue all iniuries and all the members of his bodie put off likewise their wooluish dispositions they cease to be tigers lions cockatrises and become kids lambes little children easie to be handled hardly offended and quicklie pleased which disposition we must put vpon vs the third sinne walking after their owne lusts is fitly expounded in ecclesiastes where the young man is ironically willed to walke in the waies of his owne heart and in the sight of his own eyes ampc euen so these man liue in their sinnes according to the leading and lusting of their owne corrupted hearts which sin is before in the fourth verse touched and somewhat also is further to bee spoken of it in the rest of the epistle our contrarie dutie is two fold first if at any time by frailtie we fall into any sin neuer to goe on in the same but break it off and returne vnto god for to walke after his owne hearts lusts is a note of a wicked person and an enemie of god psalm surely god wil wound the head of his enemy and the hairie pa of him that walketh on in sinne secondly wee are to frame our liues cleane against the lusts and inclinations of our owne hearts waging battell continually against them euer crossing and thwarting them rom take no thought to fulfill the lusts of the flesh galath they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with the lusts therof for whosoeuer beleeueth truly the pardon of his sinnes by christs death cannot but mortifie the lusts of his wicked heart besides that the whole course of christianitie is nothing else but a continuall conuersion and turning vnto god the fourth sin whose mouthes speake proude or swelling things that is they boast themselues of knowledge holines and things not to be found in the the same with the diuels sinne luke all this will i giue thee for they are mine and i giue them to whom i will wherein he sheweth himselfe the father of lying and boasting it is noted also to bee the property of antichrist as to whom was giuen a mouth which spake great things and blasphemies reu which was meant of the emperour indeed but so as the second beast which is that antichrist should doe all things which the first beast could doe before him ver it is also the noted vice of all heretikes and seducers corinthian to exalt and praise themselues the contrarie duties are first in common speech neither to praise nor dispraise our selues for vanitie lurketh in both besides that modestie will not suffer the former and the latter is to occasion others to praise vs which is but vanitie secondly when in speech wee compare our selues with others our equals wee must euer thinke and speake better of them than our selues philipp let euery man esteeme other better than himselfe paul comparing himselfe with the apostles said he was the least of them all because he had been a persecutor corinthian thirdly if any speake of his owne wants when iust occasion is offered hee must speake euen the most against himself as paul that he was the head and chiefe of all sinners fourthly if a man vpon iust occasion bee moued to commend himselfe first he must doe it in all humilitie and modestie so paul speaketh of himself in another person corinthian i knew a man in christ which was taken vp into paradise ampc and in nothing was i inferiour vnto the very chiefe apostles though i be nothing verse the fifth sinne hauing mens persons in admiration the word person in scripture signifieth the face and outward apparance of a man and consequently the things belonging vnto the person as riches honours dignities for the which these false teachers haue man in admiration qu is it not lawful to admire a prince or other potentates at all ans yes but when man admire them only for their person riches honours nobilitie without respect of the feare of god or true vertue this is unlawful and the sinne of these man wherein is also included the contempt of the religious poore yes and also of the rich themselues if they trulie feare god iam my brother haue not the faith of our lord iesus christ in respect of persons teaching vs that it will not stand with true religion nor with the faith of christ to honour man only because they are rich or noble first note here that no man carrieth so base a minde and such slauish affections as the proud ambitious person he magnifieth the great man and is seruilly addicted vnto him euen for outward respects not esteeming him for that which is indeede worthie to be respected secondly the condition of great man for the most part is miserable who haue many to admire them but few to amonish them rich man are admired for wisedome whereas the same man if they were poore would carrie away no praise thereof ahab had foure hundred false prophets who thus admired his person but onely one micha who faithfullie admonished him thirdly our dutie is to honour them that feare god rich or poore high or low it being a note of a childe of god to contemne a vile person that is a wretched sinner but to honour them that feare the lord bee they neuer so base and yet the honourable much more if they bee found in the waies of religion the sixth sin because of aduantage that is for profit sake where their couetousnes which before was touched is here againe taxed the effect of which affection is to blind the minde that it cannot iudge aright of persons or things it maketh a man account an enemie of god rightly honourable and to deeme the things below of highest regard let vs weede out of our hearts this bitter roote of couetousnes which otherwise will so blind vs as we cannot truly discerne the people and things of god but take egyptians for israelites and accept of the red pottage in stead of the blessing in these words the apostle goeth about to answere an obiection that might be made by the church after this manner we cannot bee resolued that these man against whom yee write are so vngodly as you would make them the answere whereto is framed in the amp verses the effect of which is that in the last times there shall bee mockers and these be no other than the man of whom he writeth and lest they should yet doubt of the truth of that he spake he bringeth in the testimonie of the apostles in the confirmation of the same so as his doctrine was no other than that which was before by them deliuered where three things are to be considered first a preface to the testimonie verse secondly the testimonie it selfe verse thirdly the amplifying of it verse for the preface but yee beloued remember ampc first the apostle iude setteth out his owne dutie and practise in that whatsoeuer he speaketh it proceedeth of loue and he is not carried away in speaking or writing with sinister affections and therefore he calleth them beloued this ought to be y e practise of al teachers who out of their inward loue to god people committed vnto them are to vtter whatsoeuer they teach yes and no man in any other calling may lay aside this affection in the discharge of the duties therof seeing it is the end of all the commandements in the second word remember is laid downe the dutie of the church amp faithfull people of god which is to remember the words spoken by the apostles of the lord iesus christ which we also in this age are to bee exhorted vnto for very weightie reasons first it is a notable remedie against al sinne and especially the forenamed sinnes psalm in my haste i said all man are liars that is whe i remembred not the word of god but forgat my own dutie and was carried away with the streame of my owne affections against faith then i failed and was foiled psalm i haue hid thy testimonies in my heart that i should not offend against thee secondly this remembrance is a notable remedie against heresies and schismes and all false doctrines and is of much vse in these our daies wherein wee are in danger to bee seduced partly by atheists partly by papists and partly by carnall gospellers against all whom wee had need to bee well fenced and armed by the reading knowing beleeuing and remembring the wordes of the prophets and apostles which onely are as dauids sling to ouerthrow the great goliahs thirdly it is an excellent meanes to settle the conscience in the truth by perswading the same and the rather to be enforced because many alleage that there are so many religions and opinions that they wil be of none for they knowe not which to betake themselues vnto but if these were diligent in the words of the prophets and apostles in reading searching and sifting out the truth in humilitie they should finde wherein to settle themselues secondly by this second word all teachers are to take notice of their dutie which is to whet the word of the apostles vpon the hearts mindes and memories of their hearers so as they may learne and remember them and the rather because in former ages religion was destroyed and superstition preuailed because that man laid away the scriptures out of their hands and betooke themselues to the exposition of other mens writings and to glosse vpon the sayings of their ancestors whereby they brought a black darknes ouer these parts of the world the prophets and apostles giue another direction malachy the last of the prophets referreth vnto moses and the former prophets and iude the last of the apostles vnto the former apostles shewing what ought to bee the scope of all teachers that would follow their steps thirdly hence all students of diuinitie are taught what they must most remember namely the words and writings of the apostles for these are the key of the olde testament and of the whole scripture which dutie if it were well obserued popery superstition and atheisme could not so farre preuaile but fall downe to the ground as dagon before the arke thirdly he nameth the authors of the testimony who were the apostles of our lord iesus christ implying their authoritie and taking it for granted that whatsoeuer they spake or writ must be receiued as an infallible truth and may not be contradicted now the better to know both what the apostles were and what this authoritie is consider three points first their calling and the greatnes thereof they were called by christs owne mouth ioh as the father sent me so i send you by which comparison hee designeth them to a particular and weightie calling standing in these points first as christ was immediatly called by the father so were the apostles immediatly called by himselfe secondly as christ was sent from the father to preach to the whole world being the great prophet and doctor of his church so christ sendeth them into the whole world for the whole worlde was their charge thirdly as christ was sent to reueile his fathers will which before was hid to the greatest part of the world so they were sent by christ to reueile the fathers will partly in making things more fully knowne which were before but darkly shadowed and partly in foretelling things to come they all being euangelicall prophets in these three standeth that comparison in regard of which manner of the sending they are aboue euen the angel themselues nay the angels were as it were but their schollers ephesians now vnto principality and powers in heauenly places is made knowne by the church the manifold wisedome of god that is by the ministrie of the apostles the mysteries of god concerning mans redemption haue bin reueiled to the angels themselues secondly consider their authoritie which was most authenticall seeing that neither in teaching or writing they could erre being specially priuiledged therefrom matth it shall be giuen you in that houre what ye shall say the peculiar promise of direction belonging to the apostles is recorded in ioh the spirit of truth shall leade you into all truth in which regard they were bold to ioyne themselues with the holy ghost it seemeth good to the holy ghost and vs namely in ordering the church affaires yet here that distinction which is falsely applied to the pope is true in the apostles by reason of this assistance that as they were priuate man and in other causes they might and did erre but not as apostles in performing their office apostolicall thirdly their worke or office they were master builders of the church of the new testament yes founders therof both by teaching doctrines and informing the manners of man farre passing all euangelists pastors teachers or ordinarie ministers since their daies corinthian as a skilfull master builder i haue laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon for the furthering of which great worke in their hands they had giuen them first a power to worke miracles for the confirming of their doctrine secondly of giuing the holie ghost by imposition of hands thirdly an apostolic rod to strike and correct obstinate offenders by the which peter smote ananias and saphira with present death and paul elymas with blindnes vse marke that now the pope claiming authoritie apostolicall from peter it is but a false challenge for that authoriti ceased with that office and seru onely to lay the foundations of the church withall being both extraordinarie as calling was and personall ceasing with the persons of the apostles so as if the pope succeeded peter in any thing it is in the denying of christ it cannot be in founding the church which was done to his hand so many hundred yeeres before him this verse containeth the testimonie it selfe the preface of which was laid downe in the former wherein two things are to bee noted first the time when wicked man shall abound in the church in the last time secondly what maner of persons they are namely described by two properties first they are mockers secondly fleshly for the time it is called the last time which is the time from the ascension of christ vnto the end of the world it may be asked how could this be called the last time seeing it is sixteene hundred yeeres agoe ans it is so called for two causes first because it goeth next before the end of the world and shall be closed vp of the last day corin to admonish vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come secondly in regard of former times according to the seuerall ages of it in which god altered the condition of his church and renewed his couenant from time to time vnto the same as first plighting it with adam and afterward renewing it to noah thirdly to abraham often repeating it fourthly to dauid fifthly at the returne out of the babylonish captiuitie sixthly at the comming of christ but now christ being come and that fulnes of time wherein the former prophecies are fulfilled and accomplished the shadows amp ceremonies are abolished amp the new couenant of grace established there remaineth no renewing thereof neither any other alteration of it but as christ hath alreadie appeared in his humilitie by his first comming so nothing is to be expected now but his second comming in glorie and this is the proper and principall cause why this is called the last time secondly concerning the persons of the vngodly me they are described first to bee mockers these are described by peter epistle in the last times shall come mockers which will walke after their lusts and say where is the promise of his comming that is those that shall scorne all religion and make a mocke of god godlines and godly man than which there is not a greater height of wickednes of whom salomon speaketh as being so far gone that they are past all admonition and therefore would not haue them admonished and dauid maketh this the highest degree of a wicked mans proceeding in his sinne to sit him downe in the chaire of scarners psalm vse this part of the testimonie is most truly verified in our age first in the roman church whose religion setteth vp a plain mockerie of god and of christ of scripture and of true religion first for christ they make but a mocke of him the true christ is a king and so they say but the pope must controule him both in making lawes of his owne to binde the conscience as also in adding and detracting from christ lawes what hee will the true christ is a sauiour but they make euery man a sauiour of himselfe by meriting saluation for they teach that christ merited that we might merit our own saluation yes the true christ is a mediatour but yet saints must bee intercessors and his mother whom they intitle the queene of heauen must commaund her son by the right of a mother to heare their prayers and forgiue their sinnes what is this but to make his mother mediatour in his stead secondly as for the scriptures they renounce the originall bible and the greeke and hebrew text as corrupt and will admit of none as authenticall but the latin translation yes and of that allow no sense but that which the pope authoriseth and setteth downe what is this else but to make a mockerie of the scriptures no bible no sense will serue nor must stand but the popish sense which is indeed to reduce all scripture to the popes will and determination secondly if wee come home to our selues we shall finde this scripture verified among the swarmes of atheists which make but a scorne of the word and religion tell any man almost of his dutie he will be readie to say how know you these to be moses writings and these to bee the apostles writings which goe vnder their names and may not falsehood bee written as well as truth these are most prophane and blasphemous scorners but such as were prophecied of before by the apostles themselues againe amongst those that professe religion are many scorners that let a man make but a shew of goodnes and begin to make conscience of his waies if he will not blaspheme and sweare as he was wo if he will not drinke with the drunkard if he refuse such company as he conuersed with before or will not doe as others doe hee is presently condemned for a precise foole or with such reprochfull tearmes how then is not this prediction of the apostle accomplished when euen the performing of morall duties yes and such as stand by the lawes of god and the land is scoffed at as a blemish when scorners are so rife and bold euen in the face of the church when where god hath his little flocke the diuell hath a large kingdome let vs not be offended too much when we heare and see these scorners but then acknowledge the accomplishment of this prophecie and contrarily loue and reuerence the word of god as a most pretious treasure the second sinne whereby these vngodly man are described is that they walke after the lusts of their owne hearts wherein two things are included first that these vngodly man shall haue their hearts filled with vngodly lusts secondly that they shall walk after these lusts concerning the former sundrie things are to be knowne first what this lust or concupiscence is ans in the scripture it is of two sorts either originall or actuall or it may be considered two waies first as it is the fountaine or ofspring of all other sinnes or secondly as it is a fruite of the corruption of our hearts the former is an impotencie of the heart whereby it is inordinatelie disposed to the desire of this or that euill of which iames speaketh chap euery man when hee is tempted is drawne away by his owne concupiscence hence is the whole corruption of the heart or originall sinne called lust because it principally sheweth it selfe in these lusts the latter is actuall lust that is euery inordinate and euill motion of the inner man against the law of god which proceedeth as a branch or fruite from the fromer roote rom let not sinne raigne in your mortall body that ye should obey it in the lusts of it where by lusts are meant the flames and motions of lusts springing from the former fountaine this lust i call first an inordinate motion to distinguish it first from a holy lusting in the regenerate dauid lusted after and desired the commandements of god yes aboue gold and siluer and there is a lust of the spirit against the flesh as wel as of the flesh against the spirit secondly from a naturall lusting which is an appetite after meate drinke ampc which in it selfe is no sinne lazarus desired without sinne the crummes vnder diues his table these lusts then are not to be condemned but only lusts inordinate secondly i say euery euill motion because lust in the scripture comprehendeth all thoughts and motions against god law so is the commandement to bee vnderstood thou shalt not lust ephesians among whom also we had our conuersation in times past in the lusts of the flesh in fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the minde where the apostle inlargeth it vnto all motions inclinations passions and perturbations of the heart minde will or affections so farre as they are not directed by the law of god this text must be vnderstood of actuall lust of which there be two degrees for sometime it is sudden and sometimes voluntarie the former is the first motion of the minde conceiued but without consent the latter is the motion conceiued but with consent purpose and deliberation which may be made plaine in this similitude the eye is sometimes cast vpon an obiect on a sudden without any purpose or intention of the minde but sometimes purposely and steadily vpon the same and as in the twinkling of the eye it is often shut without thought or purpose but sometimes againe of purpose and deliberation to preuent some hurt so is it in the minde the heart is a furnace of lust the flames whereof arise sometimes vpon the sudden and sometimes vpon leisure and deliberation both these degrees must here bee vnderstood concerning which lusts there be three things further here to be considered first the qualitie and nature of these lusts in that they are said to bee vngodly lusts such as their root is such are these branches and therefore are in their nature properly sins yes principall and master sinnes yes and sinning sinnes causing man to goe on in sinne qu if they be sinnes what commandement of the ten condemneth them ans sudden lust before consent of will is condemned in the tenth but voluntarie with consent is condemned in all the nine former if this distinction bee not held we cannot make tenne commandements for in all the commandements lust is forbidden necessarie then it is that lust should be thus distinguished and also referred as wee haue said quest some may aske in what commandement is original sinne condemned ans some say it is forbidden in the whole law which is not vntrue but yet it seemeth to be directly condemned in the first and last commandements for these two concerne properly the heart of man the first respecting the hart directly so farre as it concerneth god the last so farre as it concerneth man whether himselfe or others vse this teacheth vs to detest the popish error which teacheth vs that inordinate lusts be no sinnes if consent of will be not added but that is false for if they bee conceiued in the minde they are the sinnes of the minde condemned in the tenth commandement ob but they say there can be no sinne properly produced without consent of will ans in ciuill matters the reason is good that none can be accessarie vnto sinne vnlesse consent of will be added but in diuine matters and in the court of conscience it is farre otherwise secondly in the lusts note the propertie of them in these words which walke after their propertie is to raigne in man and to cause man to giue attendance vpon them yes and to walke after them where they are not resisted and repressed they make that man a vassall and slaue vnto them rom let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodie to obey the lusts of it where the apostle insinuateth so much that they force and compell man to the obedience of the the whole order and course of which regiment is liuely described iam by fiue degrees first lust tempteth and that two waies first by withdrawing the heart from god secondly by intising and intangling the minde with some delight of sinne secondly lust conceiueth when it causeth the will to consent and resolue vpon the wickednes thought vpon thirdly it bringeth foorth when it forceth a man to put in execution the things consented vnto and resolued vpon fourthly it perfecteth the birth of sinne vrging a man to adde sinne vnto sinne vntill he come to a custome which is a ripenes and perfection in sinning fiftly it bringeth forth death that is euerlasting vengeance and destruction in all which hee alludeth vnto the beginnings proceedings and end of a man who after he is past his full strength decaieth againe and dieth by these degrees the lusts of the heart rise vnto this raigne and regiment in the heart of euery wicked and naturall man where grace ouercommeth not nature thirdly obserue the number of these lusts after vngodly lusts where he speaketh in the plurall number as of many for originall concupiscence is the seede of all sinne in euery man and looke how many sinnes there be in the world so many lusts are there in the hearts of man so as seeing there is no number of the euils in the world euen so are the lusts of the heart innumerable therefore truly may wee conclude that vngodly man haue their hearts filled with vngodly lusts the second point in the words is that these vngodly man shall walke after their lusts which is then done when man first suffer their hearts to be withdrawne from god by euill lusts and motions secondly giue assent thereunto thirdly practise them fourthly keepe a course and trade in sinning which is the perfection of it thus a man denieth the true god and excludeth him out of his heart and setteth vp the diuell yes his owne lusts for his god vnto which hee becommeth a slaue so as this is no small sinne doct hence note a difference betweene the regenerate and the reprobate for if the childe of god be enticed and drawne away from god he grieueth for it and giueth not readie consent vnto the temptation secondly if through frailtie he bee ouercarried to giue consent yet it is not full consent but he doth it against his will and purpose for his purpose is not to sinne thirdly if he put lusts in execution he lieth not in them he will not walke after them but recouereth himselfe because he is incorporated into christ he hath the roote of grace which shall not vtterly die in him the seede abideth in him which at last shall sproute vp to repentance and amendement of life and hereby may a man know whether he be the childe of god or no vse first whereas all man good and bad haue innumerable lusts in them we are to take notice of the vilenes and vncleannes of our nature which is common to the good and bad betweene whom there is no difference but by grace our endeuour must bee to see more and more these lusts stirring and moouing themselues against god and man secondly to mourne and bewaile them thirdly to pray that god would burie them all in the death and graue of his son that they stand not vp in iudgement against vs being euery of them sufficient to procure our eternall destruction secondly we must not suffer sinne to raigne in vs for this is the part of an vngodly person true it is that lusts will be in the heart whilest a man is in the flesh but they must bee resisted that they may not raigne and rule the heart quest how shall we keepe vnder the lusts of the heart from raigning ouer vs ans seeing sinne raigneth in the minde by euill thoughts our thoughts on the contrarie must bee framed according to the word and ordered by the counsell thereof according to the apostles aduice philipp if any thing be honest vertuous of good report we must thinke of these things coloss let the word of god dwell plentiously in you again lust raigneth in the memorie by remembring vanities wrongs and wicked speeches and actions wee must therfore remember our sinnes the number and greatnes of them the curse of the law against them the day of our owne death and the generall iudgement the remembrance of which shall be able to keepe out or at least to keepe vnder these vngodly lusts further seeing it raigneth in the affections of pride reuenge hatred ampc wee must learne the exhortation philipp let the same minde be in you that was in iesus christ that looke as christ was most milde meeke humble patient full of loue towards god and man so ought our vnruly affections to bee conformed vnto his and lastly seeing it raigneth in the bodie by idlenes ease sleepe in excesse which make the bodie an instrument of sinne wee must alwaies diligently inure our selues to the duties of our callings vsing fasting watching and prayer by which meanes well obserued the lusts in the heart may still trouble and molest vs but they shall not rule and raigne ouer vs vse if it be the propertie of a wicked man to follow after vngodly lusts wee ought to purge our selues from all the lusts of the flesh and spirit corinthian lest these defile our body and soules in the powers and parts of them to doe which the better remember that blessed are the pure in heart secondly to inure our selues vnto the feare of god seeing the feare of god is cleane psalm that is it clenseth the heart and breaketh the necke of all noysome lusts this verse containeth the application of the former testimonie vnto the particular persons whom it concerneth setting downe who they be that are scorners and followers of their lusts namely scorners are they that make sects separating themselues from the people of god and followers of their lusts be those who are fleshly and without the spirit which words being applied to these seducers fasten two sinnes more vpon them the first whereof is that they are makers of sects the second that they haue not the spirit for the former the word signifieth a singling and separating of themselues from the church and people of god and consequently the making of sects to themselues neither may this seeme strange that there should be such persons that make such separation seeing it is the nature of euery sinner to flie from the presence of god as adam did and peter when he had seene a part of the glorie of christ bad him depart from him for he was a sinner the prodigal son must haue his portion apart and will not be perswaded to liue with his father and euery vngodly man withdraweth himselfe vnto perdition heb doct first it is a great sinne for a man to separate himselfe from the assemblies of god people because first it is a flying from god and his presence whose face euery one is commanded to seeke seeing he presenteth himselfe in the word and sacraments and wheresoeuer two or three are assembled in his name ampc secondly it is a contempt of god ordinance which whosoeuer despiseth despiseth god himselfe thirdly out of the catholike church is no saluation the saying is true whosoeuer will not haue the church for his mother shall not haue god for his father fourthly the congregations of god people on earth are the suburbes and gates of the kingdome of heauen whosoeuer therefore shutteth the gates of this kingdome of grace against himselfe here shall neuer enter into the gates of the kingdome of glorie hereafter vse our dutie hence is to ioyne our selues to the assemblies of the faithfull not forsaking the fellowship that we haue among our selues heb but keeping the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace ephesian being like minded one towards another rom speaking one thing as those that are knit together in one minde and one iudgement corinthian and if we would separate our selues then let vs depart from the atheists and papists in their corrupt doctrines and wicked conuersation secondly such are iustly reprehended who seldome come to heare the word receiue the sacraments and to call vpon god in the congregation for so much as they can they cut themselues from the kingdome of god in reiecting the meanes of their saluation ob they alleage for themselues that if they should come they should heare but a weake man like themselues speak vnto them and if christ himselfe or some angell should preach vnto them they would heare willingly ans lay aside all disputing and yeeld vnto the wisedome of god whose ordinance it is that man should be taught by man and not otherwise ob they say further that they haue the bible and the sermons of the prophets and apostles at home and none can make better sermons than they and againe that they can get knowledge enough to saluation by themselues and some say they haue knowledge sufficient and neede no more ans first god ordinance must be acknowledged and reuerenced in the publike ministerie and in the middest of the assemblies and priuate duties must giue place to publike secondly the word is not only to be knowne but affected now although knowledge may bee gained priuately yet the affections must bee wrought and mooued in the publike ministerie thirdly those that know the most know but in part and the ministerie is instituted not onely to initiate and begin man but to confirme them in grace and leade them to perfection for which end the lord hath giuen pastors and doctors of the church to teach man vntill they come vnto a ripe age in christ which is not till death now for the further cleering of this point two questions are to be resolued quest seeing it is a sinne for a man to seuer himselfe from the church of god where and what church is that to which a man may for euer ioyne himselfe with a good conscience ans that people which heare beleeue and obey the doctrine of the prophets and apostles are the true people and church of god vnto which a man may safely ioyne himselfe diverse notes there be but the infallible notes of the true church are knowledge faith and obedience vnto that doctrine these were the notes of the primitiue church next after christ act first they continued in the apostles doctrine secondly in fellowship wherein the duties of loue are comprehended thirdly in breaking of bread that is the administration of sacraments for the celebration of the supper is put for both fourthly in prayer that is inuocation of god with thankesgiuing in that commission of the apostles giuen for the gathering together of the church of god they are enioyned first to teach all nation that is to make them disciples namely by the doctrine propheticall and apostolicall secondly to baptise them that is to bring and admit them into the house of god thirdly to teach them to performe all things which they were commanded in which commission two of these notes are expressed ephesian the church is founded vpon the doctrine of the prophets and apostles ioh if ye abide in my word ye are truly my disciples ioh my sheepe heare my voyce and followe mee psalm he sheweth his lawes to iacob and his statutes to israel he dealeth not so with euery nation hence we note that wee may not ioyne our selues with the iewes or turkes who renounce the words of the prophets and apostles neither yet with the papists for though in word and speech they holde this word yet in deede and in the sense they corrupt it euen in the foundation the second question but what if there be errors in the church or things amisse may wee not then separate our selues ans things that may be amisse in the church must be distinguished for some faults concerne the matter of religion some the manner the former respecteth doctrine principally the latter the manners of man first for things amisse in the manners of man wee may not separate but with lot haue our righteous hearts vexed and grieued with the wicked conuersation of those among whom wee liue the scribes and pharisies sitting in moses chaire teaching moses his doctrine must bee heard howsoeuer the corruptions of their manners be such as they may not bee imitated matth yet here obserue further that although we may not separate our selues from such corrupt persons in the publike assemblies yet in priuate conuersation wee may abstaine from them corinthian if any that is called a brother be a fornicator or couetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one eat not that is eate not priuately secondly if the church erre in matter of religion then must we consider whether the error be in a more weightie and substantiall point or in matter of lesse importance if it be in smaller points the foundation being kept wee may not separate our selues corinthian if any mans worke burne he shall lose but himselfe shall be safe yet as if it were by fire now if the error of the church bee in substance of doctrine or in the foundation then we must consider whether it erre of humane frailtie or of obstinacie if of frailtie we may not separate the church of galatia was through frailtie quickly turned to another gospell and erred in the foundation holding iustification by workes yet paul writeth vnto it as vnto a church of god so likewise the church of corinthian erred grieuously and ouerthrew the article of the resurrection and yet paul behaued himselfe accordingly vnto it but if the church erre in the substance of religion obstinately then with good conscience separation may be made tim if any man teach otherwise and consent not to the wholesome doctrine from such separate thy selfe an example hereof we haue in act when paul had preached in the synagogue of the iewes and could not preuaile with them but they began to blaspheme and speake euill of the waies of god then he withdrew himselfe and separated from them chro when ieroboam had set vp the two calues to be worshipped many of the best disposed iewes departed from him and came to rehoboam and ioyned themselues with iudah and ierusalem in the true worship of the god of their fathers whence wee see that no man may with good conscience separate himselfe from the church of england seeing it teacheth beleeueth and obeyeth the doctrine of the prophets and apostles further consider the manner of the separation of these wicked man there be three sorts of separation first by apostasie when a man falleth wholy from his religion from the church and from common grace heb it is impossible that they which were once enlightened if they fall away ampc secondly by heresie when man erre in the substance of doctrine and religion and that of obstinacie thirdly by schisme and that is when man hold the same faith and foundation and yet disagree and separate in regard of order and ceremonie these seducers separated themselues by heresies their heresies were these first that man being in christ might liue as they list and so they were libertines secondly that among the people of god there ought to be no ciuil magistracie and so they became also anabaptists here obserue that euen in the apostles time and daies were many heretikes among whom was hymeneus and philetus tim and many wolues entred euen in their daies which spared not the flocke which may serue to stablish our mindes against the papists who obiect that our religion is the foundation of al heresies as at the rising of which many heresies were reuiued in so much as they call all our religion heresie and the professors of it heretikes by which reason they might as strongly prooue that the doctrine of the apostles themselues was heresie and that the primitiue church in the apostles time was hereticall and no church for in the first hundred yeeres after christ the church swarmed with heresies sowen by sathans instruments to the choaking of that holy doctrine which was sowne by the apostles and their successors in the fielde of the church nay rather we conclude our religion to be apostolicall because the same heresies which arose vp in the apostles times against their doctrine now reuiued againe vpon the reuiuing of our religion the second sinne of these seducers in this verse is that they are fleshly or natural man for so it is explained in the last words not hauing the spirit wherin consider two things first who is a naturall man secondly that it is a sinne to be a naturall man for it is noted as a maine sinne in these seducers touching the former a naturall man is he who liuing a naturall life is endued with a reasonable soule and is gouerned by nature reason and sense onely without grace or the spirit of god which may appeare first by the word naturall which signifieth such a man as in whom the best thing is nature and in whom there is nothing more excellent than his reasonable soule though corrupted secondly by the exposition or rather opposition in the words wherein it is opposed vnto the spirit who is wanting vnto such a one to leade him in the way of a heauenly life further that yet wee may know this matter the better there be three things to be found in a naturall man he hath a bodie and soule vnited together in one person in his soule he hath excellent powers and faculties as will vnderstanding affections hee hath all the ornaments of man yet so as without grace such as are strength of bodie and minde memorie knowledge of arts and sciences ciuill policie and vertues as iustice prudence temperance discretion to discerne what is meete to bee done what not these are ornaments incident to corrupt nature seruing not to abolish but to restraine and bridle corruption and containe man in order for the preseruation of humane societie now he that hath these three and nothing else is but a meere naturall man the second point is that it is a sin to be a naturall man here it may bee asked how it commeth to passe that a naturall man because he is a naturall man offendeth god ans there bee two things in euery naturall man to bee distinguished first there is nature secondly the corruption of nature the former is from god the latter from mans fall which two may be indeede distinguished but cannot now be separated the one is not the other but the one is not without the other this corruption is that sinne which presseth vs down and hangeth so fast on heb which hath corrupted the whole ma so as the whole frame of man that is his whole disposition and inclination is corrupted and euill from his youth genes his wisedome is enmitie to god that is euen the best thing that is or can be in the flesh is hateful to god rom himselfe is dead in sinnes and trespasses ephesian hauing no more abilitie to mooue to any thing truly good than hath a dead man to bestirre himself in and about the actions of life for the cleerer beholding of this corruption of mans nature marke that there bee two degrees of it the former whereof is a want of that goodnes and righteousnes which at first was and now ought to be found in our nature the latter is a pronenesse and disposition vnto all euill which carrieth the heart on euery occasion thereunto this corruption must bee conceiued as an ocean sea sending out into euery channell and veine of the soule and whole man streames and floods of wickednes for looke into the principall powers of the soule ye shall neede to goe no further for the finding of this truth for first in the minde is such an impotencie as whereby it is vnable to thinke or approoue of any thing that is truly good corin wee are not sufficient of our selues to thinke of any good but all our sufficiencie is of god corinthian the naturall ma perceiueth not the things of god which is most manifest thus first hee knoweth not god himselfe aright for although hee may know god as an infinite and eternall being or in some other attribute yet he cannot know him as a father to himselfe secondly hee knoweth not neither conceiueth the corruption of his owne nature nor his sinnes originall and actuall in the staine and danger of them thirdly he conceiueth not of the remedie of sinne the death of christ but accounteth it foolishnes that life should be brought out of death secondly as his mind is blind so a naturall mans will is rebellious and is not subiect vnto the will of god neither indeed can be ioh no man can come to christ vnlesse the father draw him insinuating our withdrawing of our selues and resistance of his call vntill he turne vs amp make our wils of vnwilling willing wils to will that which is truly good whece the apostle saith that to will namely that which is truly good is not of our selues it is the gift of god now hence wee may resolue that question why it is a sinne to bee a naturall man not because a man hath nature in him but because his whole nature is tainted with originall sinne ob the naturall man may pleade that he cannot helpe it hee was borne sinfull why then should he be blamed ans rom in adam we all sinned for when he eat the forbidden fruit we euen eat it in him amp are no lesse blameworthie than he was ob but it will be said it is no reason that we should bee said to sin in him seeing then we were not ans adam was a publike person representing all mankinde and euery particular person desceding from him and therefore what he did all and euery man did in him euen as a burgesse in the parliament giuing his voyce and assent all the country or shire is said to giue their voices though they be absent and not present otherwise than in his person god then giuing a prohibition vnto adam hee gaue it vnto all vs in him and threatning him he threatned vs and all mankinde this onely is the difference that hee being the roote or flocke and wee the branches arising from him hee sinned actually and we by relation and imputation if then the naturall man still pleade hee was no cause but was borne so the answere is cleere that himselfe is a cause although not in himselfe yet in adam before he was borne he procured that he should be borne a naturall man secondly it may be pleaded againe if i be a naturall man i am god creature as i am why then should i be blamed ans the former distinction betweene nature and corruption of nature must be here retained for by the former the naturall man is god creature and not in respect of the corruption of nature for this he created not as the other but suffred it to passe by generation from man to man for the execution of the punishment of the first sinne quest why did not god stay this corruption in adams person ans god could haue done it why he did it not the reason is neither knowne nor to be enquired a secret it is but yet a iust iudgement of god silently to bee with reuerence rested in and not with curiositie to be searched out vse first some may hence gather if a man be iustly blamed for being only a naturall man and not hauing the spirit of god then euery one hath power to receiue the spirit of god ans this is no good reason but is all one as if because a bankrout is blamed for not discharging his debts to his creditors another man should conclude that surely he is therefore able to pay them but these wicked man were blamed here first because they professed christ but yet had not his spirit secondly because that in adam they were the causes that they were borne without the spirit of god and so made themselues vnfit to receiue him secondly if naturall man bee iustly condemned much more those that are worse than they as atheists prophane persons those which contemne the assemblies and neglect the meanes of their saluation and yet looke for saluation as wel as others the gentiles who were without the law doe the things of the law by nature rom and yet many that professe the name of christ and liue vnder the gospell goe not so farre as those naturall man in doing the things of the law so as euen those heathen and naturall man shall rise vp in iudgement and condemne many a professor of christ of whom euen many come short of the diuell himselfe who beleeueth and trembleth and yet not a few professors neither know what the diuell beleeues neither through h rdnes of heart can tremble at the iudgements of god as he can doe thirdly those come farre short that think themselues in state good enough because they liue ciuilly and deale iustly and neighbourly as they say for the naturall man can doe this and yet shall be condemned no plea shall stand at the great day of the lord but that which assureth of the pardon of sinne sealed vp with the blood of christ let a mans outward and ciuill righteousnes be neuer so great yes if it could be equall to the righteousnes of the scribes and pharisies which for outward appearance was without all exception yet if hee bring not a righteousnes exceeding that he can neuer be saued fourthly in that the naturall man is blamed for being a naturall man this ouerthroweth all merits of congruitie which the papists boast of because a mans person not being accepted before god all his works are sinnes the worke neuer pleaseth god till the worker first please him fifthly euery professor of christ must strip the naturall man and become a spirituall person that is such as the spirit of god dwelleth in for first as the father worketh our saluation by giuing christ and his merits so must the holie ghost by applying the same vnto vs else can we looke for no saluation secondly as the soule giueth life to the bodie which else were dead so the spirit of god is the soule of our soules and quickneth them with new life being dead in sinne thirdly wee can neuer know that wee are in christ or belong vnto him but by the presence of the spirit in our hearts ioh hereby we know that he abideth in vs euen by the spirit that he hath giuen vs quest but how shall a man know whether hee hath the spirit or no ans let him examine himselfe first whether he inwardly loue and feare god in his word of promise and threatning secondly whether he subiect his heart and life vnto him thirdly whether his heart be continually lift vp in inuocation and thanksgiuing all these are the workes of the spirit of god and they which of the spirit thus sauour and ffect the things of the spirit rom quest but i feare i haue not the spirit how shall i obtaine it ans by vsing the meanes of reading the word meditation and prayer especially luke your heauenly father giueth the holy ghost to th that desire him psalm i meditate in all thy workes and stretch foorth my hands vnto thee in this verse vnto the end of the are set downe some meanes whereby all beleeuers may be fitted to the maintenance of the faith and true religion vnto the which the apostle hath in the former part of the epistle perswaded these meanes are contained in fiue rules here prescribed first concerning faith secondly loue thirdly hope fourthly meekenes fifthly christian seueritie the first of which is contained in this twentith verse which is that they should build themselues vpon their faith which is not barely propounded but inforced and vrged first by a motiue in this word most holy faith secondly by the meanes of it which is prayer praying in the holy ghost in the rule note two things first that faith is a foundation secondly that the dutie of beleeuers is to build vp themselues vpon this foundation concerning the former first is may be demanded what is here meant by faith ans here by faith is not so much meant the gift of faith as the matter of it namely the doctrine of faith and religion comprised in the writings of the prophets and apostles in which sense it is said that the ephesians were built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles that is vpon their doctrine ephesian the same was the rocke confessed by peter vpon which christ promised to build his church and yet in the second place we must not exclude the gift it selfe for although the doctrine be a foundation in it selfe yet it is not so to vs vnlesse we beleeue it and applie it to our selues by this gift if any man aske what doctrine is this i answer the summe of it may be reduced to three heads the first whereof concerneth mans miserie by his sinne originall and actuall as also the dangerous fruits thereof the second the redemption of man from this miserie and his freedome by christ the third the thankefulnes which man oweth for this deliuerance and ought to testifie and expresse in newnes of life hence learne first what is the infallible marke of the true church whereby it may be discerned from the false and apostaticall church and that is the doctrine of the prophets and apostles for this being the very foundation of the church where it is there the church must needes bee and this note of it selfe is sufficient to point out the true church wheresoeuer secondly seeing faith is the foundation of the church and not the church the foundation of faith beware hence of a damnable doctrine of the popish church which teacheth that there can be no certainty of the points of religion no nor of the scriptures themselues but onely by the iudgement of the present church of rome and that church must giue what sense soeuer she pleaseth to the scriptures else hath it none wherein they play the part of preposterous builders laying the foundation in the top of the building thirdly it may be demaunded how any doctrine becommeth a foundation vnto the saluation of man answer properly to speake god and christ is our foundation and rock psalm but because god reueileth himselfe and the meanes of our saluation in the word it becommeth hence a foundation as also secondly because christ who is the proper foundation is the summe of the doctrine therein contained vse first let no creature draw vs from christ for then wee are drawne from our foundation secondly the affections of our heart towards christ must exceed all affections of any thing besides our loue feare hope confidence and trust must settle themselues vpon him as vpon a foundation the second thing in this first rule is the dutie of euery beleeuer which is to build himselfe vpon his faith which that a man may doe sixe things are required first hee must haue in his heart a deepe sense and feeling of his miserie in such sort as not finding in himselfe whereon to be founded hee may feele himselfe to be founded vpon god and christ euen as in laying strong and sure foundations man digge deepe and if they finde sure ground proceede on in their purpose so this wise builder laieth his foundation on a rocke luke secondly hee must haue knowledge of this doctrine of the prophets and apostles for vnlesse it bee knowne it can bee no foundation thirdly a holie memorie to lay vp the word of god in their heart as in a storehouse for he that remembreth not the doctrine of saluation can neuer build vpon it fourthly faith whereby not only we beleeue the truth of it but applie it vnto our selues this knitteth vs vnto the foundation without which the word shall bee no more profitable vnto vs than the iewes who mingled it not with faith heb for this only applieth it vnto our hearts iam fifthly the doctrine beleeued and applied must take a deepe rooting in the heart it must descend into the affections and there be imbraced vntill it hath wrought out an experience of the sweet comfort of it sixthly there must be an vnfained obedience vnto the whole word of god not euery one that saith lord lord but he that doth the will of my father matth this man buildeth wisely vpon the rocke quest but what is that which must be done of vs ans whatsoeuer is to bee done of vs may be reduced to three heads first faith whereby the beleeuer truly resteth himselfe vpon god cleaueth vnto christ for the pardon of sinne and renounceth all other meanes in heauen and earth secondly repentance whereby he truly turneth from all sinne vnto god thirdly new obedience whereby hee endeuoureth to obey god in all his commandements vse first here is reprooued the carnall protestant who holdeth his religion but for forme and fashion or for feare of lawes he is altogether without foundation and in a pitifull condition seeing when the great day of the lord shall approach whosoeuer shall want christ their foundation shall fall before him secondly we must neuer suffer our selues to be drawne from our faith and religion nor lose our hold of the doctrine of godlines though wee should suffer losse of lands liuings liberties yes or life it selfe if this bee once wrested from vs wee are fillen the foundation and haue lost hold of happines and life i selfe thirdly wee may not take any est till we be builded vpon this foundation it being the foundation and ground worke of all our safetie and securitie for christian man are as houses built vpon the sea shore who must looke for the wa s and billowes of afflictions one in the necke of another euen as one surge in the sea ouertaketh another how should they hold out when this raine falleth these floods come these windes blow and beate vpon their house vnlesse they be founded vpon this rocke how else should not their fall be great but this sure foundation establisheth the heart against all calamities of this present life yes in the houre of death also which otherwise is the downfall to hell yes and in the day of iudgement the sentence shall passe on their sides who are laid on this foundation they shall be found worthie to stand before the lambe when the diuell and his angels with all sinners and sinne it selfe shall be cast into the bottomlesse lake now as euery particular christian man is to be a practiser of this dutie in his owne person so also may it bee fitly applied to the state of the whole land which by god blessing hath had for many yeeres this foundation laid within it through the which it hath been able to withstand yes and subdue many rebellions treasons forces and powers intended against it and besides hath had securitie and safetie vnder god protection with much peace and prosperitie would we now know the way to haue this peace and securitie continued to vs and ours the way is to continue and abide vpon this foundation not looking backe to popery or superstition but taking out the wholsome counsell of good king iehoshaphat put your trust in the lord and yee shall be assured beleeue his prophets and ye shall prosper in this dutie of beleeuers marke further first how the apostle ascribeth power to the beleeuer to build himselfe for although by nature man want this power for the naturall man cannot of himselfe so much as thinke one good thought yet the regenerate whom the lord by his spirit hath mooued haue a power giuen them to mooue themselues and build themselues that which was before to nature impossible is made possible by grace secondly note further the force of the word build vp which requireth not onely a building but a going on and encreasing in building as if he had said build vp your selues more and more a dutie which neerely concernes man in these daies wherein man decline to atheisme and popery which also is but a painted atheisme when man can cotent themselues to goe backe and fall from their former loue and are afraid to bee found either hot or cold this disease of our daies hath this apostle forwarned vs of in this epistle being one of the last farewels of the apostles to the church let vs then take notice of our declinings and doe our first works and goe on forward to perfection building vp our selues daily lest it come to passe that the lord come against vs spue vs out of his mouth remoue our candlesticke with his other blessings and leaue vs vnto our too late and vntimely repentance the motiue whereby this rule is inforced vpon the church is drawne from a propertie of faith which is that it is most holy wherein to vnderstand it we will shew first what holines is properly secondly that faith is most holy for the former in this holinesse there bee two things first a freedome from all fault and blame secondly an excellencie or perfection consisting of many diuine vertues holinesse thus vnderstood is two fold vncreated or created vncreated is the holines of god which is nothing else but the perfection of his properties and attributes this holines is incomprehensible and infinite yes the fountaine of all other holines created holines is a certaine gift of god which by some proportion resembleth this vncreated holines of god the subiect whereof are angels man and god ordinances especially the written word so as this holines of faith is this deriued holines and not the former secondly how is the doctrine of religion most holy ans first in it selfe being without all fault and error and hauing sundrie excellencies being full of diuine wisedome and truth and the onely instrument whereby god infinite wisedome and goodnes is made knowne vnto vs secondly in regard of the effect and operation which is to make the creature but especially man holy ioh sanctifie them in thy truth thy word is truth it sanctifieth man instrumentally in that it maketh them resemble god in many graces by this dauid became wiser than his teachers psalm and so resembled god in wisedome iam this wisedome which is fro aboue of which the word is the instrument is pure peaceable easie to be intreated full of mercie and good fruites without iudging and without hypocrisie thus wee see how it maketh man resemble god in all these yes and in all other vertues thirdly it is most holy because it sanctifieth all inferiour creatures to the vse of man so as hee may vse them with good conscience tim euery creature of god is good sanctified by the word and prayer where by the way may be noted the superstition of the roman church which halloweth bread salt water palmes ampc for the curing of diseases casting out of diuels amp working wonders which practise of theirs is nothing but the defiling and prophaning of the creatures by superstitious prayer seeming to hallow them yet without any word or warrant either of promise or commandement which is the principall instrument of sanctifying the creatures vnto their lawful ends and vses hence learne first that the doctrine of the prophets and apostles is from god because it is full of wisedome without any follie full of truth voide of all falsehood as also most holy both in it selfe and in operation and effect and in the author as proceeding from him who is the fountaine of all holines it is not of man neither needeth the euidence of man by this propertie only if it had no more it carrieth with it and containeth within it sufficient euidence against the gates of hell that it is from god and holy as himselfe is secondly the word being most holy it must dwel in our hearts plentifully and our care must be that it may be written in the tables thereof that it may bee an ingrafted word bearing rule ouer our wils and affections yes ouer our whole liues for where it ruleth it sanctifieth the whole man thirdly the doctrine of true faith sanctifieth vs but as it is receiued beleeued and applied by faith and no otherwise when it taketh place in vs then it sanctifieth vs it is not the rehearsing of the articles of it nor the knowledge of it nor carrying about with vs the words of it that can worke grace but the hiding of it and mingling it with faith in the heart from which we gather that it is a foule error of the papists to teach that the sacraments conferre grace by the worke wrought and that as the penne writeth by the hand of the writer and that of it selfe the hand mouing it so the sacraments of themselues sanctifie being administred by the minister but this is erroneous for the word and the sacraments are both of one nature the sacraments being none other but the word made visible but the word read or vttered sanctifieth not by the worke done but by being beleeued and applied by faith therefore no more doe the sacraments by being administred but by apprehending christ in them grace must be conferred by the spirit of grace and not by the vertue of any action in the sacraments the last point in this first rule is the meanes whereby beleeuers are to build vp themselues in their most holy faith and that is prayer praying in the holie ghost wherein euery member of the church is put in minde of a principall dutie namely that whensoeuer wee feare or foresee a falling and defection fro the faith by reason either of weakenes within or persecution without the time it is to repaire vnto god by the prayer of faith crauing at his hands strength and power not onely to bee preserued from reuolt but also to bee confirmed in the faith and doctrine wherein we stand the apostle hauing exhorted the ephesians to stand fast and be strong in the lord and hauing prescribed some meanes tending to that purpose in the verse hee concludeth the principall of the rest to bee prayer praying alwaies with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and that it is so appeareth by two reasons first by prayer faith is exercised yes and increased according to the increase whereof the other graces of zeale hope patiece and constancie are likewise confirmed and animated secondly faithfull prayer hath a faithfull promise made vnto it ask and ye shall haue seeke and yee shall finde knocke and it shall be opened vnto you these promises we must lay old vpon and applie vnto our selues for the stirring vp of continuall prayer and strengthening of grace especiallie in time of temptatio and in sense of frailtie and then god will be good in hearing and helping as his promise is now in this meanes obserue the manner of making prayer in these words in the holy ghost which are added for foure causes first to giue vs to vnderstand that although a man be regenerate yet he cannot pray as he ought vnlesse hee be still mooued helped and stirred by the holy ghost god giueth sundrie graces in the conuersion of a sinner first a preuenting grace which yet is not at all effectuall vnlesse it be seconded and helped with a supplie of a second grace for that is true euen of the regenerate without me yee can doe nothing ioh god giueth first the will and then the deede philipp yes and the continuance of the doing of that which is truly good hee that hath begun the good worke will performe or finish it chap here let grace be euery way grace lest it be no grace at all let god who is all in all haue all the glorie of all as for the doctrine of mans merit and humane satisfaction which robbeth god to enrich man it here falleth to the ground the second is because prayer is a singular and especiall worke of the holy ghost in vs who stirreth vp in vs these grones and sighes which we cannot expresse rom and maketh vs crie abba father zach this spirit of grace and compassion is promised to bee powred out vpon the house of dauid and inhabitant of ierusalem and from hence a man may examine and finde whether he be the childe of god or no for if he haue the spirit of god he is his and if he haue these holy motions and desires to pray and can send out these cries vnto god vnfainedly he hath the presence of the spirit and he that hath not this spirit in these blessed fruites of it is none of his thirdly these words are added to teach vs that when wee pray wee must doe it our hearts for where the spirit of god dwelleth thece must prayer proceed but his abode is in the heart and therefore prayer that god many acknowledge it to proceed from the spirit must bee hartie and so of all other spirituall duties colloss singing with grace in your hearts rom whom i serue in my spirit where the apostle expresseth a reason why prayer should proceed from the heart because prayer is of the same nature with faith and the spirituall worship of god yes indeede is a part of it answerable vnto god himselfe who is a spirit but all these are seated in the heart and spirit and consequently prayer it selfe ought so to be neither is it the outward action or words which is simply the worship of god but so farre as they consent and proceed from the heart which teacheth vs that whatsoeuer religious dutie wee are to turne our selues vnto wee are first of all therein to approoue ou hearts vnto god fourthly that there may bee a distinction made betweene the true beleeuer and the hypocrite and carnall man the hypocrite he prayeth outwardly for forme and fashion the naturall man in affliction prayeth of compulsion as a man that is racked and tormented without any loue of god at all both of them without any inward sense or rectified disposition of the heart but the beleeuer hee prayeth in the heart and in faith the spirit of god disposing his heart aright vnto prayer quest how doth the holy ghost direct the heart answer by fiue waies or meanes first by illumination whereby hee reueileth god to man as also his owne estate both of them in part secondly by conuersion whereby hee turneth the heart vnto god once made knowne thirdly by direction whereby hee directeth the heart to deale as with god himselfe taking it from outward meanes fourthly by feruent and constant desire for things spirituall or temporall fifthly by faith whereby we can rest on god for the accomplishment of the things wee haue heartily desired quest whether may we not pray to the holy ghost seeing here it is said praying in or by the holy ghost ans we may not onely pray in or by him but vnto him for although wee haue no particular example hereof in the scripture yet wee haue sufficient warrant for the three persons being vndiuided in nature must be also vndiuided in worship and one being worshipped all must be worshipped secondly wee are baptized into the name of the holie ghost as well as of the father and son and therefore hee is to be prayed vnto euen as they are ob but wee are not commanded to pray any where by the father or son as here by the holie ghost which argueth that the holie ghost is not the author of our prayers as they are answer the apostle here would haue vs obserue an order in the working of the trinitie for all the three persons are authors of our prayers the father and son make vs to pray but by the holy ghost the holy ghost maketh vs pray but more immediatly for he is the immediate author of our prayers which teacheth that when we pray it is not of our selues but from the spirit which stirreth and sendeth vp heauenly requests for vs herein then wee must renounce our selues magnifie the grace of god within vs and shew our selues thankfull by entertaining carefully such holie motions of this most holie spirit of god these word containe the second rule of the apostle tending to the preseruation of faith and true religion concerning loue and it is indeede of speciall vse and direction for the framing of our liues christ calleth the loue of god and man the summe of the whole law paul calleth it the end of the commandements this caused paul to keep faith amp good conscience corinthian the loue of christ constraineth vs now for the better informing of our vnderstandings and our furtherance in obseruing this rule fiue things are to be considered first what is meant by the loue of god ans wee are to vnderstand by the loue of god a diuine vertue in the hearts of the beleeuers whereby they loue god and christ properly and simply for himselfe rest in him and cleaue vnto him as the most absolute good for by god loue in this place is not meant that loue wherby god loueth man but whereby man loueth god quest why doth the apostle here omit the loue of man ans because the loue of man to man is included and to bee vnderstood in the other as a fruit necessarily flowing from it for first whe a man loueth his neighbour herein after a sort he loueth god for then is god loued not onely when our affection of loue is directed vnto himselfe but also when his ordinances his creatures image and other things partaining vnto him are loued secondly the apostle paul calleth the loue of the neighbour the fulfilling of the law which cannot be vnlesse we include also therein the loue of god or rather it within god loue and ioyne them both together now if the loue of man be the fulfilling of the law how much more is the loue of god which by the same reason must include the other thirdly it is a true rule in diuinitie that the first commandement must bee included and practised in all the nine following as being the foundatio of them all now the maine dutie of the first commandement is the loue of god which must goe with the practise of all the other so as al the duties of the other comandements are included in y e same the second point is whether this loue of god bee in man by nature or giuen by grace ans it is not from nature but a gift of grace following faith and iustification ioh if yee loue me yee will keepe my commandements both which proceed from one beginning as no man then can by nature keepe the commandements so no man can by nature loue god aright rom the wisedome of the flesh that is mans best things his best thoughts and affections is enmitie to god therefore can there be no true loue of god in nature tim the end of the commandement is loue out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and faith vnfained againe wee must first beleeue that wee are loued of god before wee can loue him epistle ioh we loue him because he loued vs first it will bee obiected here luke many sinnes are forgiuen her for she loued much where it seemeth that loue is the cause of forgiuenes of sinnes ans i answere this word for doth not signifie here a cause but a reason drawne from the signe as it is also elsewhere vsed this then is the sense many sinnes are forgiuen her and hereby ye shall know it because or in that she loued much note hence first that doctrine of the church of rome to bee false whereby they teach that before iustificatio there must be a disposition and aptitude in a man thereunto standing in a feare of hell loue of god ampc for by this doctrine y e loue of god in man should go before iustification which is a fruit and follower thereof secondly that is as false that loue is the soule and life of faith for though in time they be both together yet in the order of nature loue followeth after faith amp therfore cannot be the forme and soule thereof thirdly it hath bin the opinion of some that faith apprehendeth christ by loue and not by it self but this is also erroneous for loue in order followeth apprehen on of christ and therefore christ is not apprehended by loue first we beleeue and being knit vnto christ by faith then our hearts are knit vnto god by loue the third point is what is the measure of loue whereby we must loue god and man ans according to the two distinct parts of the word of god are prescribed two distinct measures of loue the measure of the law is to loue god without measure for it requireth that wee loue god with all the powers of our body and soules and with all the strength of all these powers luke this measure is not now in our power to performe no not although wee bee borne anew for being still flesh in part some of the powers of our strength are withdrawne from the loue of god the gospell is a qualification of the law and moderateth the rigour thereof it freeth a man not fro louing god but exacteth not this loue in the highest measure and degree but accepteth such a measure as standeth in things first in beginning truly to loue god secondly in the daily increase in this loue thirdly in being constant in the same vnto the end this measure the lord accepteth for perfect loue in those that bee in christ in whom the imperfection is couered deut the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart that thou maist loue the lord thy god with all thine heart and all thy soule that is as if the lord had said i will engraft the true loue of my selfe in your hearts which you shall increase in and constantly proceede in the same and then i will account and accept of it for the full measure of loue that my law requireth which distinction is the rather to bee considered because the papists teach that the loue which the lord requireth of christians is the same for substance and measure which the law prescribeth and for the perfection of our loue they say a man may doe more than the law bindeth him vnto as if he gaue all his goods to the poore it is more than euer god in his law hath commanded and if wee loue god aboue all creatures which they say a man may doe though imperfectly it is the loue which the law prescribeth but all this is most false and so the apostle galath concludeth it as many s are vnder the workes of the law are accursed if all man bee condemned by the law then is no man able to performe the loue and duties which it requireth but he taketh the former for granted for else his argument could not hold and therefore that none can performe the loue which the law enioyneth is true secondly the common opinion of man is that they euer loued god with all their heart and it i pitie hee should liue that doth not so but it is a m re delusion for if it were so what needed any qualification or moderation of the law by the gospell the fourth point is wherein standeth the loue of god ans epistle ioh this is the loue of god that ye keepe his commandements ioh he that keepeth my commandements is he that loueth me the reason whereof is this he that loueth god loueth his word and he that loueth his word wil bewray his loue in yeelding answerable obedience thereunto and in one word this keeping of the commandements standeth in these three things first in faith for it must bee the worke of a true beleeuer secondly in conuersion vnto god thirdly in new obedience which sheweth many a man how miserably he hath been heretofore deluded by satan for euery m n professeth and pretendeth the keeping of the commandements and yet the most are so farre from doing them that they know them not neither care to know them the fifth point is how a man should preserue in him the loue of god and of m n ans first the meanes whereby man may preserue himselfe in the loue of god is two fold first euery one must labour daily to haue his heart setled in the sense of god loue towards himselfe for the more he shall feele god loue confirmed vnto him the more shall his loue bee inflamed and increased towards god againe euen as the more wee feele the heate of the sun the warmer wee are secondly wee must keepe a daily obseruation of god blessings spirituall and temporall which is a speciall meanes not onely to confirme and augment our loue but preserue it constant to the end psalm i will loue thee dearely o lord why what made dauid thus resolue himselfe the reason is rendred in the next words the lorde is my rocke my fortresse my strength and hee that deliuereth mee secondly man must vse the meanes whereby they may preserue their loue to man and these are of two sorts for some stand in meditation others in practise the meditations are foure the first is the consideration of the spirituall and neere coniunction of all those that are true beleeuers of which number wee professe our selues all to be who haue all one father god one mother the heauenly ierusalem the catholike church all begotten of the immortall seede the word of god all liue by one faith in christ and all are heires of eternall life and glorie this was pauls motiue perswading him hereto ephesian there is one lord one faith one baptisme one god and father of all see philipp the second meditation is that the duties of loue which man sheweth to man especially the faithfull god accepteth as done to himselfe so saith the wiseman he that giueth to the poore l ndeth vnto the lord and matth when i was hungrie ye fed me ampc namely in my members vpon earth the third meditation is the consideration of that curse which is due to them that neglect duties of loue to man when occasion is offered matth depart ye cursed i was hungrie ye fed me not to auoide this curse we must embrace the apostles counsell to walke in loue the fourth is to consider that the loue of man to man is a grace of god which leadeth a man by the hand to the first degree of happines ioh he that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in god and god in him that is hee hath entred the first degree of happines for hee hath fellowship with god and verse if wee loue one another god loue is perfect in vs now as nature it selfe can tell vs a happines is to be sought for so let this grace leade vs to the degrees and beginnings of it the second sort of means stad in practise and the rules of practise be sixe the first is the practise of the law of nature being the summe of the law and the prophets by christs own testimonie whatsoeuer ye would that man should doe vnto you doe you the same vnto them the meaning of which golden rule is this looke what we would haue other man to think speake and do to vs that must we thinke speake and doe vnto them and no worse and on the contrarie consider what we would not that man should thinke speake or doe vnto vs that wee must abstaine to speake or thinke or doe vnto them the practise whereof would cut off many wrongs contentions fraudes and iniuries both in word and deed the second rule of practise is in gal doe seruice one to another by loue that is let euery man in his place and calling become servant to another and so preserue loue by the duties of loue the reason hereof is because god although he might if he had pleased preserued man without man would haue man preserued by man and that euery man should be his instrument for euery mans good in regard both of bodie and soule for which end he hath furnished man with seuerall artes sciences trade and callings that one man might stand in need of the help of another secondly we are placed in the world that here we might serue god indeed not in speculation onely but also in our whole practise in our standings and callings he will be serued of vs in our seruing of man for these two must goe together and as it were hand in hand the seruice of god and the seruice of man whosoeuer therefore imploy their callings principally for the purchasing of their profit pleasures honours and not for the good of man they abuse their callings prophane their liues and mistake the proper end of them as though they were borne onely to liue vnto themselues and serue themselues and neither god nor man besides from which too common a practise hath that diuellish speech sprung and by satan put into the mouthes of many man euery man for himselfe and god for vs all a speech well beseeming those who are at open enmitie with the duties of true loue the third rule is in philipp let your moderate minde bee knowne vnto all man wherein is commended that meeknes of minde whereby wee can with moderation and equitie beare with man for the preseruation of loue see philipp this moderation standeth in foure actions first in bearing with defects and infirmities of nature as hastines frowardnes desire of praise slownes and such weakenesses it is the part and propertie of an equall minde not to be seuere or hastie against these but rather to passe by them as salomon saith it is the glorie of a man to passe by an infirmitie secondly in couering many yes a multitude of sinnes yes and if a man be called to reueale and discouer them by way of testimonie it causeth a man not to aggrauate the crime but equally to speake euen as the thing i thirdly in construing mens meanings words and actions if it be possible in the better part euen so farre as the word of god giueth vs libertie for it is a fruite of malice to misconster man to make an offence where it is not giuen or not to bee taken and that i so long as the wickednesse is not apparant fourthly in restoring him that is fallen into a fault by the spirit of meeknes curtesie and humanitie euen as a surgeon dealeth with a broken arme or legge not with roughnes or anger but with mildnes yes and pitie towards the offender so setting him as it were in ioynt againe the fourth rule is in rom be affectioned one towards another with brotherly loue how may that bee done answer in the next words in giuing honour goe one before another not in taking honour as our nature is but in preferring others before our selues and here wee must not conceiue of this honor as a meere ceremonie standing in some outward gesture but it is a reuerent opinion conceiued inwardly in the heart whereby euery man thinketh better of another than of himselfe and accordingly yeelds him more honour but some will say here this is hard to doe to esteeme of euery man better than our selues and how may we attaine vnto it ans whosoeuer iudgeth this so hard a lesson let him enter into the serious examination of his owne heart without partialitie let him looke narrowly into himselfe and hee shall espie such a bodie of sinne for measure and manner as he cannot finde in any man besides so as in the true sense of his estate he can neuer abase any man so farre as he can himselfe whereby he shall come to iudge euery man worthie to bee preferred and honoured before himselfe the fifth rule is in ephesian let not the sun set vpon your wrath a very necessarie rule for seeing we be but man we cannot be without many sinfull motions and especially of reuenge vpon occasion but here we are counselled forthwith to stay and represse them yes and to break them vtterly off that although anger wrath and reuengefull thoughts will arise vp in our hearts yet we must extinguish them and not suffer them to continue with vs no not for the space of a day the same christ himselfe hath taught mark when ye stand to pray forgiue if ye haue any thing against any man so often then as we are to pray which is at the least daily so often are we to forgiue iniuries offered to vs for we pray to be forgiuen as our selues doe forgiue others man content themselues to carry their wrath a whole yeere together and if they forgiue once a yeere at easter or at the receiuing of the sacrament once a quarter it is as much they thinke as they neede to doe but they forget that the sun must not goe downe vpon their wrath the sixth rule rom let euery man please his neighbour some will say how can this be for some will neuer be pleased if wee condiscend not to their corrupt and wicked desires ans the next words expound the apostles meaning for good what is that ans for his edification so as the generall commandement admitteth this limitation that man must be pleased but onely so farre as it tendeth to god glorie their owne good and edification so rom haue peace with all man but yet with a double limitation first if it be possible secondly if it be in you or so much as lieth in you wee must not carrie crosse and thwart mindes as being enemy vnto peace but applie our selues to the preseruation of it in our selues and others thus shall we testifie our selues to be admitted into god kingdome wherein the lion and lambe play together and the yong childe with the cockatrice isai whereby thus much is signified that man once conuerted shall be so changed and altered that if they were neuer so fierce and cruell against the church and one against another before yet now they shal be framed to a peaceable and meeke disposition towards all man now to perswade vs to the practise of these rules consider first that these are the last times wherein most man are louers of themselues and louers of man for their owne aduantage euen so farre as by them they may attaine and retaine their wealth pleasures and pompe but few are they that loue man for god or his graces in them now seeing the times more call for these duties let vs bee the more carefull in them secondly loue amongst man is the bond of societies for what else linketh man to man but loue which therefore the apostle calleth the bond of perfection and truly for it maketh man speake and thinke one thing and perfecteth their societie seeing then christian societies are god ordinances and preserued by loue wee are to labour the more in the preseruation of it thirdly the office and action of loue is most excellent for the manifold gifts and graces which god bestoweth on man for the vse of the church and common wealth are all hereby made profitable thereunto all ordered hereunto aright and all hereby applied to their right ends and vses the gifts of knowledge tongues artes wisedome and such like without loue they puffe vp but it is loue that edifieth corinthian and which causeth man to applie and vse these gifts to the good of man the third rule for the maintenance of faith concerneth hope in the next word looking for the mercie of our lord iesus christ vnto eternall life wherein is contained a description of hope which is this hope is a gift of god whereby we waite for the mercie of iesus christ to eternal life for the better conceiuing of which grace consider in the words three things first the person on whom wee are to waite by hope namely our lord iesus christ together with the properties of this waiting which are foure first it must be certaine without doubting for the apostle ascribeth a full perswasion and assurance vnto our hope as wel as vnto our faith heb neither doth hope make a man ashamed by disappointing him of the thing hoped for rom secondly it must be against hope that is against all humane hope reason sense and whatsoeuer may be grounded vpon these thus abraham beleeued against hope rom thirdly it must be a patient waiting on christ rom if we hope for that we see not we doe with patience abide for it for otherwise the thing hoped for deferred maketh our waiting painfull and tedious fourthly it must be grounded vpon the word and promises of life psalm my soule hath waited and i haue trusted in his word heb the ground and anchor of our hope is made not onely the promise but the oath of god who cannot lie although he should not sweare that we might h ld fast the hope that is set before vs the second point is the thing for which we must waite which is not for gold siluer honours pleasures but only for the mercie of god in christ vnto life eternall by which we must not vnderstand the beginnings of mercie for these we alreadie here enioy and hauing the present hold thereof need not hope for the same but for the full measure and accomplishment of god mercies hereafter to be enioyed the like manner of speech hath paul rom we waite for our adoption and redemption not that wee are not alreadie adopted and redeemed but that it is not as yet fully finished and accomplished in vs as hereafter it shall be the third point is the fruite and profit of this waiting and that is life eternall and therefore is added vnto life eternall giuing vs to vnderstand that our waiting shall bring vs vnto and set vs in the possession of this life so as the description standeth in setting downe two effects of hope described first that it causeth to waite on christ for mercie secondly that it doth not faile nor make a man ashamed for he waiteth vnto eternall life and in this expectation is put in possession of the same from the former effect we learne first to put a difference betweene hope and confidence first by hope we waite on christ but by confidence we rest vpon him and quiet our hearts in him secondly hope is of things to come and confidence of things present at least made present by faith matth haue confidence and thy sinnes are forgiuen thee whence we may discerne an error in popish religion they teach with vs that a man is to haue confidence in christ but they include it vnder hope and will not permit that it should bee referred to faith because then they should be drawne to grant a speciall faith but that is erroneous seeing confidence is not of things to come as hope is but of things present and therefore although confidence goeth with hope yet it is no branch of it but proceedeth from faith secondly seeing this waiting is a certaine expectation of christ hence i gather that there is a speciall faith for if there bee a speciall hope there must needes be a special faith to ground this speciall hope vpon for wee can neuer certainly waite for that whereof we are vncertaine whether it belong vnto vs or no he that hath receiued the earnest may certainly waite for the whole summe but it is faith which receiueth the earnest of the spirit from whence our hope is raised heb now faith is the ground of things hoped for for which cause it is that hope also hath his full assurance ascribed vnto it as well as faith and hence wee may further take knowledge of another of their errors whereas they teach that hope indeed is ioyned with a certaintie but they distinguish of certaintie which is they say either of the will or vnderstanding hope they graunt hath the certaintie of will but not of iudgement and vnderstanding but this is false seeing the apostle heb commandeth to reioyce in hope which no man can doe vnlesse the iudgement be certaine and setled he that is not certaine of mercie can neuer hope certainly for mercie thirdly wee learne hence to waite by our hope in christ for life euerlasting euen to the death that must be the white which must euer be in our eye at which wee must continually direct our aime we haue many examples of holy man who haue gone before vs in this dutie iacob when hee was making his will inserteth and as it were interlaceth this speech o lord i haue waited for thy saluation gen moses had his eye euer vpon the recompence of reward heb iob would trust in the lord yes although he should kill him iob dauid was much and often in this expectation of the lord mercie psalm in waiting i haue waited on the lord that is i haue instantly waited and mine eyes haue failed me whilest i haue waited for my god psalm and psalm my flesh shall rest in hope his hope was that his flesh should rise againe vnto life euerlasting obiect but how ca we nourish this hope will some man say seeing we are so tossed amp perplexed with so many miseries and grieuances in this life ans paul meeteth with this obiection rom we reioyce in tribulation qu how can we doe so ans when wee subiect our selues vnto god in afflictions he sheddeth abroad his loue in our hearts and this breedeth patience which bringeth foorth experience and experience hope which maketh not ashamed being the helmet of saluation and our anchor which staieth our ship in the troublesome sea of this life fourthly if wee must by our hope waite on christ then in all our requests and petitions vnto god we must abide the lord leisure not limiting him or prescribing the time vnto him of hearing for herein our hope must exercise it selfe further from the obiect of this waiting which is the mercie of god we may learne diverse points first that there is no such merit of worke as the papists dreame of for then might we waite for iustice and of due lay claime to life eternall but here we haue another lesson read vs namely that the saints of god iustified sanctified and so continuing for to such iude wrote as verse must waite for the mercie of god vnto life eternall yes let a man keepe all god commandements hee shall merit nothing he doth but his dutie in the second commandement the lord saith he shewes mercie on thousands but who are they euen to them that loue me and keepe my commandements if adam had stood in innocencie he could not haue merited any better estate than hee was in how much lesse can wee since the fall nay christ as hee was man alone could not merit nor did not but in regard of the personal vnion but the papist will here say that life eternal is promised vpon condition and if wee can keepe the commandements wee may merit i answere if wee keepe the condition of our selues wee may merit indeed but this is impossible for euen our keeping of the condition were of mercie and mercie and merit will neuer meete and stand together secondly if we waite for mercie in christ then must wee altogether despaire in regard of our selues of euer attaining life euerlasting for hope sendeth a man out of himselfe and causeth him wholy to relie himselfe vpon christ thirdly if we must waite for the accomplishment of mercie which tendeth to life euerlasting then much more must wee in our dangers or troubles waite for god mercie in our deliuerance if wee must waite for the greater wee may for the lesse hab at last the vision shall speake and not lie though it tarrie waite and isai he that beleeueth maketh not haste this meeteth with mans corruptio who in present trouble will haue present help or else he wil fetch it from hell it selfe from satan and sorcerers but such neuer learned to waite on god mercie for saluation for then could they waite his leisure in less matters for health and ease and with more comfort make farre lesse haste secondly from the second effect or fruite of hope namely that it deceiueth not nor disappointeth him that hopeth note first a difference betweene humane or carnall and religious or christian hope the former often deceiueth man at least when death commeth all such hopes perish but the second neuer deceiueth a man in time of need no not in death it selfe secondly hence a man may and must beleeue his owne perseuerance in grace for where this hope is such a man cannot fall wholie from christ for then his hope should disappoint him neither from his owne saluation because this hope laies hold on the mercie of god vnto eternall life and herein can neuer frustrate his expectation or make him ashamed thirdly if our hope bring vs to the fulnes of happines and to the accomplishment of mercie hereafter then it bringeth vs to the beginnings of this happines euen in this life for the beginning of life eternall is in this life and standeth in the conuersion of sinners vnto god and in amendement of life and whosoeuer hath true hope hee is thereby stirred vp vnto daily repentance and reformation of life ioh he that hath this hope purgeth himselfe euen as he is pure now there is none of vs but wee say wee hope for life eternall and looke to bee saued by the mercie of god in christ it standeth vs the in hand to trie the truth of this hope within our selues and manifest the truth of it vnto others and both these by this note namely that we finde it to purge our hearts and liues and that it conforme vs vnto christ for if we hope to be like him after this life we must labour to resemble him euen in this life by being in some measure pure holy innocent meeke louing ampc euen as hee was for otherwise if our liues be not in some reformation of our selues and conformitie to our head sutable to the profession of our hope it is but pretence of hope and will make man in the end ashamed these words containe the two last rules tending to the preseruation of the faith both of them teaching how we may and are to recouer and restore those who are fallen or declining from faith or good conscience for the better vnderstanding whereof consider in the words two things first the way to begin this recouerie which is in the end of verse by putting difference secondly the manner how they are to be recouered expressed in both the rules the former concerneth christian meeknes haue compassion on some the latter concerneth christian seueritie and other saue with feare concerning the former the way of this recouery is to put a difference that is by christian wisedome to distinguish betweene offenders for our direction wherein wee must know that man erre and offend two waies first in opinion and iudgment secondly in practise and life againe those that erre in opinion are also diuersly to bee distinguished according to the diuersitie of their errors for some erre in the foundation of religion and matters of greatest importance as the papists at this day when they teach inuocation of saints iustification by workes a reall sacrifice for the quicke and dead in the supper with other false doctrines racing the foundation others may hold the foundation but erre in smaller pointes of less importance as for example the anabaptists holding that war is not to be made nor othes to be taken erre grossely but yet herein though in other points they doe they race not the foundation these ought wisely to be distinguished for hee that erres in the foundation ouerturneth his faith and religion but he that holdeth the foundation and erreth in smaller points doth not corinthian if any man build on the foundation hay or stubble worke shall burne but himself may be safe one thing it is to beate downe a wall to pull downe a window yes some one side of a house and another to plucke vp the foundation for this destroieth al which difference if it had been made and minded many which haue separated themselues fro the church of england had still remained members of it secondly of those that erre in opinion some erre of ignorance and blinde zeale seeing no other truth than that they hold as the iewes did rom who had the zeale of god but not according to knowledge others erre of malice who know they are deceiued and yet persist obstinately in their error amp false opinion lest they should lose their credit as heretikes now betweene these also a difference is to be put tit an heretike after once or twice admonition reiect for such a one is condemned of his owne selfe but if the error be of ignorance paul speaketh if any be otherwise minded the lord will reueile it philipp but here we must alwaies remember that seeing wee can hardly discerne the ground of mens errors whether they proceede of ignorance or malice wee are euer to condemne their error but haue respect to their persons and not passe sentence rashly against them for the error of the vbiquitie of christs bodie hath been held and maintained b many both godly and learned protestant their error wee are alwaies able to condemne but wee may not condemne their persons no not although they haue defended it of malice or out of the pride of their hearts seeing the lord might giue them repentance before or at their death thirdly againe those that doe erre of ignorance must be distinguished for some of them are misled of simple ignorance as those who haue no meanes or very small meanes to come to knowledge others erre of affected ignorance which is when man are willingly ignorant hauing meanes of knowledge but refuse the same as aboue fourtie yeeres agoe the people of this land erred of simple ignorance because they had not the meanes which yet did not excuse the but now their ignorance is wilfull and affected neglecting at least if not fearfully despising so great saluation and therefore as the sin of the land is greater so the more fearefull is the iudgement like to be if it bee not seasonably preuented by repentance fourthly there is also wise difference to bee put betweene the author of sects and heresies and those who are by them seduced the sect masters and leaders are to bee vsed with more seueritie and sin more grieuously rom obserue them which cause diuisions among you as in a wisely ordered common wealth the heads of conspiracies and authors of treasons are most aimed at secondly errors in practise or action is any actuall sinne or offence in word or deede and man that offend in these are not all to bee ranged in one ranke but to bee distinguished for of these first some sin of ignorance not knowing what they doe as paul persecuted the church of god ignorantly amp through a blinde zeale now ignorance is two fold first generall ignorance when the thing is vtterly vnknowne secondly speciall when the equitie of a particular fact or some speciall action is vnknowne as oppression and vsurie in generall are knowne to bee euill but many particular actions vnder this kinde are vnknowne to many so to be and sometime these two ignorances are ioyned both together according vnto which we may put difference betweene the faults and offences of man secondly some sinne of infirmitie who know what they doe but yet are ouercarried by sudden and violent passions of anger feare sorrow or such like vnto euill thus peter denied his master vpon sudden feare of danger thirdly some sinne of malice being carried vnto euill by the malice of their own will not of ignorance or passion as the former of this the apostle s keth heb if we sinne willingly ter we haue receiued the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins now of this malice of the will there be two degrees first particular when a man wittingly and willingly sinneth against some particular commandement as acts the iewes were stiffenecked and alwaies resisted the holy ghost that is the ministerie of the prophets in some things not in all secondly generall malice when a man is carried wittingly and willingly to oppugne all the law of god yes christ himselfe true religion and saluation by christ and so reuerseth all the commandements this is the sinne against the holy ghost amp of this degree the apostle saith there re ineth no more sacrifice for sinne this being an vniuersall and generall apostasie now offenders according to these differences must bee distinguished further of those that actually offend some sinne secretly when it is knowne but to some one onely and priuately when it is knowne but to some few and the scandall is the smaller some sinne publikely when the sinne is notorious and the offence giuen great if the offence b secret the apostle ruleth the case saying that loue couereth a multitude of such sinnes for the second if the offence be priuate then must thou admonish the party betweene thee and him if hee heare thee thou hast saued and wonne him if not but hee persist in offending tell the church but hee that offendeth publikely must be publikely reprooued that others may feare tim by these differences obserued a notable way is made for the recouerie of those that are sliding or fallen from the faith in matter either of doctrine or practise hence wee learne first that it is our dutie to obserue one another in our speeches and actions or else wee can neuer put any difference in them the end of which obseruing must be not as the manner of many is to imitate others in their euils or traduce or floute man but that of the apostle heb let vs consider one another to prouoke vnto loue and good workes secondly for the making of this difference betweene offenders we ought to haue in vs a christian wisedome whereby wee may discerne aright of persons and things and not to iudge of al alike our head christ was a notable president vnto vs herein for though many professed him and beleeued in him yet would hee not commit himselfe vnto them because he knew what was in man ioh loue indeed must hope all things beleeue all things suffer all things corinthian but yet this christian loue must be ordered by christian wisedome the second point concerneth the manner of restoring offenders standing in two rules first of compassion secondly of seueritie in the former consider two things first on whom compassion is to bee shewed the apostle saith on some that is on those that erre of ignorance or infirmitie on those also who are caried away with y e violence of some sudden passion if they repent yes or giue any hope of amendement all such must be restored with the spirit of meeknes galath secondly the manner of shewing the compassion which is not by winking at or soothing man in their sinnes but by admonitions and exhortations seasoned with compassion matth if thy brother trespasse against thee goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him if he heare thee not take yet with thee one or two this is the meanes first to conuince the offenders and then to bring them to repentance with all mercie and meeknes and confirme them therein thus god himselfe dealt with adam first conuinced him and then in much mercie made that gratious promise that the seede of the woman should bruise the serpents head thus christ looked on peter and mercifully restored him thus paul restored the galathians being falle from the faith by mercifull admonitions ob but if we admonish man before witnes according to the rule of christ wee may draw our selues into danger for they may take such admonitions for slanders and vse them as witness thereof against vs ans if therefore the fault bee secret we must onely admonish our brother alone and if that will not serue to reclaime him leaue him to god to turne him and if it be priuate that is known to some few it is christian wisedome to admonish him before some two of those that can testifie of this sinne that so the partie admonished may be conuinced and the admonisher cleered from all shew and apparance of slaunder vse by this rule is condemned the rigour and austeritie of many in too seuere censuring offenders and offences this was a fault and blemish in the ancient church which sometime for no faults would enioyne penance as if a man had married the second time yes for small and light offences were wont to enioyne a penance of two fiue yes and sometimes of tenne yeeres this is the sinne also of those that are departed from our church condemning vs for some wants vtterly as no church nor people of god refusing to heare the word of god to pray and to ioyne in other religious duties with vs it is also the sin of many of the lutherans who because wee dissent from them in some opinions condemne vs and our churches to hell and speake and write that we are limmes of the diuel which were too great seueritie if wee held not the truth against them in the things wherein we differ vse wee ought on the contrarie to put on the bowels of compassion towards offenders if there bee any hope of amendement following herein the footsteps of christ himselfe who was very tender ouer ierusalem so as hee wept ouer it moses when the israelites had sinned in making their golden calfe he mourned for them fasted fourtie daies and fourtie nights for them and would not depart from god till he was intreated of him in their behalfe man cannot but be compassionate towards sicke and dangerously diseased or wounded body but a rare thing it is to be so tender ouer the sicke soules of our brother but blessed is hee that iudgeth wisely of the poore whether afflicted in bodie or minde the second rule of restoring offenders concerneth christian seueritie and it is the last of the fiue laid down in the verse in it the apostle laieth downe three things first the rule it selfe to saue with feare secondly the reason of the rule or manner of it pulling them out of the fire thirdly a caueat for the better obseruing it and hate euen the garment spotted by the flesh in the rule it selfe consider two things first who are to be saued by feare namely those who otherwise are incurable which is manifest in the opposition of these words with the former some are to bee cured with mercie and compassion as those which sinne of ignorance and infirmitie but those who are hardly curable must be terrified affrighted and so saued by terror and feare secondly what this feare is namely not a bodily feare as neither the meanes causing it are but a spirituall feare and that of euerlasting destruction the meanes of feare are either ciuill or spirituall the former is the power and authoritie of the magistrate who carrieth not the sword in vaine against offenders but that those that doe euill might feare rom but neither is this feare nor the meanes of it meant the second meanes are spirituall directly respecting the soule not the bodie and they be reduced to three kindes or heads first admonition with denunciation of god iudgements against the party not repenting secondly suspension whereby offenders are debarred from the lord table thirdly excommunication whereby man are deliuered vp to satan and cast out of the societie of god people of these three this last is here most properly meant ob but some will say excommunication is of no force it is lightly regarded and therefore can bee no great meanes of feare to offenders ans this censure vsed according to the word of god cannot but be full of horror and terror and the most forcible as the last meanes of this feare matth if he heare not the church let him be to thee as an heathen what will mooue a man if this will not that the whole church should account of him as a pagan or heathen the incestuous person corinthian thus censured is giuen vp to sathan and deliuered into the diuels power then which what can bee more fearefull both these places the enemy of this censure seek to elude that they might make it lesse forcible for that in matth they interpret of seeking ciuill remedie against ciuil harme or wrong as though the sense were thus if thy brother iniurie thee admonish him first priuately and if hee refuse to heare thee bring him before the magistrate thou maist goe to law with him and vse him as an heathen man in calling him before the heathen magistrate but this exposition cannot stand for to shew that it is no direction of the manner to reuenge ciuil wrongs but appertaineth vnto the conscience it is added in the very next words verse whatsoeuer they binde on earth shall be bound in heauen and whatsoeuer they loose in earth shall be loosed in heauen for the other place corin they expound it of an extraordinarie punishment which might be executed in those daies by satan vpon the body of such offenders deliuer him to satan that is say they that hee may torment his bodie but this cannot be a bare bodily punishment but an excluding of the sinner from the communion and fellowship of the church and must be done in the face of the church by the consent of the whole church which appeare to bee so verse and againe if it had been meant of some such extraordinarie punishment paul by his apostolicall rod could haue done that alone and needed not haue troubled the whole church with it the second point is the reason of this rule taken from the danger of the delay of it pulling them out of the fire they are in perill of present daunger they must therefore presently bee saued euen as things that are in the fire must be presently pulled out violently or else they are presently consumed so must these offenders be presently preserued and pulled out of the fire of hell out of these two former points wee learne diverse instructions first that their censure of excommunication is an ordinance of god and no inuention of man for euen in this verse wee may obserue first that obstinate offenders are to bee saued by terrible meanes some must bee saued by feare secondly violent and sudden meanes must be vsed they must be as it were snatched out of the fire thirdly they must bee separated from in regard of societie in the next words all which three things cannot agree to any thing but only to excommunication secondly note the end of excommunication which is to pluck man out of the fire of hell with violence and therefore this desperate remedie is only to be vsed in desperate cases whe there is no other way to saue the soule and not for trifles the surgeon cutteth not off armes and legges vntill the life bee disparaged neither the physition prescribeth ranke poyson but in most desperate diseases againe if this bee the end of it then it respecteth the spiritual estate of man and not the temporall the soule properly and not the bodie wickedly then doth the pope for the vpholding of his estate excommunicate kings and princes to depose them from their crownes and depriue them of their scepters and by it free their subiects from their allegeance this is no end of this censure warranted in the word and thirdly if there be such a necessarie end and vse of it it were to bee wished that in this end it were more vsed against open and notorious sinner whom the word cannot preuaile with to their saluation seeing many goe on euery where obstinately in their sinnes without amendment to the great scandall of others thirdly hence we learne that many bee so wedded and addicted to their wicked waies that although they be in the mouth of hell yet they feare nothing neither god nor diuel nor care neither for heauen nor hell else what neede were there of such a censure as this is ahab was so addicted to naboths vineyard that he was sicke for it besides he sold himselfe to worke wickednes manasses sold himselfe to satan nothing could returne him but setters and captiuitie fruitful of such hath been and is our barren age fourthly when gentle meanes will not serue to reclaime man it is the will of god that terrible meanes should be vsed if by any meanes they may bee pulled out of the fire and thus the lord vsed to deale with his owne people of the iewes proceeding with them according to that order in rom first by patience by long suffering calling them to repentance but when they hardened their hearts against these meanes then he hoorded and treasured vp wrath for them against the day of wrath the same hath been his dealing with vs in this land for these fourtie yeeres and more he hath hedged vs in with peace and prosperitie together with the liberties of his glorious gospell still expecting our further fruitfulnes answerable to such meanes but we become still more barren amp lesse fruitfull hee hath often taken in hand his pruning knife and lopped vs by famine pestilence and other his iudgements and yet behold we abound with bitter fruites of blasphemies iniustice prophanenes contempt of the gospel which was more embraced and esteemed of twentie yeeres agoe than now it is in these daies which make no end of declining that surely wee cannot now but expect that the lord should open vpo vs the treasures of his wrath and his storehouses of iudgements vnlesse wee vse meanes to preuent them and that in due time some will aske what bee they ans remember two rules first the counsell of amos chap prepare to meete thy god o israel meanes in this land are prepared to meete our enemy and it is well done but wee must first prepare to meete our god by vnfained repentance and forsaking of sinne for that is it which maketh the breaches of our land amp strengtheneth our enemy against vs secondly the practise of iehosaphat chro we kn w not what to doe but our eyes are towards thee o lord depend vpon him alone and nothing besides him make him thy hiding place in life and death shroud thy self vnder the wing of his protection and thou shalt be safe vnder his feathers now followeth the third point in this last rule that is the caueat tending to the obseruing of it in these words and hate euen the garment spotted with the flesh that is keepe no company haue no fellowship or societie with them which precept is propounded in a darke comparison or similitude taken from the ceremoniall pollutions of the law that look as man were th n made vncleane not onely by conuersing with persons legally vncleane but also by touching though it was vnware their houses vessels and garments as appeareth leu and numb and therefore did not onely auoide such persons but hated euen their garments so must we vnder grace deal with obstinate offenders auoide their persons sinnes yes and societies as occasions thereof first then in the former part of the comparison two questions may bee demaunded the former is this why should any mans flesh bee vncleane or his garments spotted and so detestable and to be hated seeing they are the good creatures of god answer there bee three kindes of vncleannes naturall morall ceremoniall naturall vncleannes is whereby the creature becommeth by his corrupted nature vncleane for mans vse i say by corrupted nature because this vncleannes cannot rise from created nature but from mans sinne and god curse as the serpents are now to mans vse vncleane that is noisome and full of hur and poison morall is when any creature is vsed against god law and commandement separating i from the vse of man as to marrie within any of the degrees prohibited leu commeth within this vncleannes thus a man borne of vncleane seed is vncleane iob ceremoniall is when the creature being cleane it in owne nature yet in some other respects by vertue of god prohibitio becommeth vncleane thus were certaine beast and fowles and dead body vncleane not in their nature but in some respects which especially were three first in regard of touching secondly of tasting thirdly of sacrificing in which respects th y might not bee vsed now the creature might be hated not in regard of it self or as i i the good creature of god but as farre as this ceremoniall vncleannes was fa ed vnto it it being prohibited in this or other respects by god quest but why should any m n hate the flesh or garments of another seeing this ceremoniall vncleanne was no sinne yes to burie the dead corpes was a dutie to be performed necessarily and so necessarie was it to touch them and for garments they were naturall and no more sin to touch them than to eate or drinke ans although legall defilement was not alwaies a sin yet i was alwaies an euill and prefigured the defilement of man by originall sinne and besides vpon god prohibition was to be hated secondly although the defilement it selfe was no sinne yet hee that wittingly without cause did touch or meddle wi th thing defiled did sinne because god commanded the contrarie secondly out of the second part of the similitude in that we are to the company of obstinate offenders it may be demanded whether wee may keepe any company or haue any fellowship with an obstinate sinner ans the familiar company with such is forbidden but all company is not absolutely forbidden for in two cases it is lawful to accompanie with such a one first to doe him good with conference instruction admonition an heretike must be once or twice admonished and if he bee not then reclaimed he must be auoided titus secondly when a man is bound to such a one by the bond of ciuill societie as for example if a man re by the church excommunicated y t a wife must performe the dutie of a wife the childe of a childe the servant of a servant for th se diuine ordinances abolish not but establish ciuill societies then i say familiar company must bee denied to such obstinate sinner but not all company as when by the same we can either reclaime them or else to performe some ciuill dutie toward them vse first we see here what was the end of ceremoniall vncleannes and that was o represent that spirituall vncleannes in the whole man by originall and actuall sinne in thought word and deede z ch in that day shal h re be a fountain opened to the ho se of dauid and to the inhabitant of ierusalem for sinne and for vncleannes whereby is signified such an vncleannes wherby not only our selues are defiled wholy but whatsoeuer we touch amp meddle withall which is infected by reason of that dwelling sinne in vs e en as it was which in the law was ouched by a polluted and vncleane person this consideration should ca se vs to looke into the filthines of our hearts which if we could or did see as it is both in it selfe and in the vile which without intermissio it sendeth out it would make vs humble our selues and neuer bee at rest vntill this fountaine of the blood of christ were set open vnto vs and we euen plunged into it and so clensed from this vncleannes whereof the vncleannes of the flesh was but a figure and adow vse we learne how to vnderstand the comandements of the moral law namely not only according to the letter and bare words in which they are propounded which mention the maine sinnes only against god and man but by a synecdo he in the mentioned sinnes all of that kind as all occasions also motiues and inducements thereunto as here the apostle wisheth the saints to hate the flesh yes the garments spotted so wee are to hate the sinne itselfe yes and all the kindes and all the occasions of the same vse hence wee haue a direct way wherein all beleeuers are to walke first we must hate the company and societie of manifest and obstinate sinners who will not bee reclaimed secondly all their sinnes not communicating with any man in his sinne we must haue no fellowship as with the workers so wi h the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse thirdly all occasions and inducements vnto these sinnes fourthly all apparances of wickednes thess that is which man in common iudgement account euill and all this must proceed from a good ground euen from a good heart ha ing sinne perfectly that is all sin as dauid psalm i hate them with a perfect h r d and not as some who can hate some sinne but cleaue to some other as many can hate pride but loue couetousnes or some other darling sinne but wee must attaine to the hatred of all before wee can come to the practise of this precept besides that all sinnes are hateful euen in themselues a needfull dutie to be heedfully regarded in these daies wherein are so few hate s of the flesh and so many haters of those that hate it so many that are so farre from hating the appearances of euill that many sins themselues are swallowed vp and made no bones of horrible blasphemies must now credit mens speeches the breach and violating of the sabbath in iourneying is good a seruice of god horsebacke neede be or as he requireth r inge also fightings and such work of the flesh are notes of valour and spirit and so in other thus man who professe religion in word denie it in deed seeing true religion standeth not onely in the hatred of the sinnes themselues but euen of all occasions and apparances of them because god hath commanded them to be hated vse as y e iewes being not to come neer the houses nor touch the vncleane if they did touch any such thing they were vncleane and polluted and for that cause must wash their body and chaunge their garments yes if they did but suspect that they had defiled themselues they were presently to bee purified so wee being defiled with any knowne sinnes or suspecting any vnknowne our next course must be to the bloud of christ the lauer of the church suing vnto god by prayer that our sins may be therewith washed away wee must put off our garments that is the olde man with his lusts and put on the wedding garment that is christ iesus with his righteousnes daily proceeding in the duties of sanctification for he that hath washed himselfe had need stil ha e his feete washed that is daily renew his repentance and bring daily fruits worthie amendement of life in these wordes are contained the third part of the epistle namely the conclusion of it and it is nothing else but a lawding and praising of god wherein three things are to bee noted first the person praised which is christ the second person in the trinitie the son of the eternall father this appeareth by two reasons in the words first because he is here described to be a iudge that doth present all man before himselfe which is proper to the son of god secondly because he is called our sauiour which is the title of christ according to the name iesus and yet here must be noted that in this praising of the son the father and the holie ghost are not excluded for as the nature of the three persons is all one so is their worship all one also the second point bee the reasons or inducements mouing vs to praise christ which be three the first drawne from his power to him which is able ampc the second from his wisedome to god onely wise the third from the worke of our redemption and saluation our sauiour the third point is the praise it selfe in these words be glorie and maiestie and dominion and power both now and for euer amen of these points in order and first of the person to whom this praise is giuen first note how the apostle concludeth his epistle with the praise of christ as the iudge as also the sauiour of mankinde in whose example we are taught with willing minds to spend our daies in the honour of christ for that which the saints doe in heauen that must we doe while wee liue vpon earth for so we pray in the lord prayer but they in heauen continually doe cast downe their crownes at the feet of the lambe reu as worthie to receiue all honor and glorie and praise and power we must therefore bee readie vnto this dutie againe he hath subiected himselfe to exceeding dishonour and abasement yes to the death and that of the crosse and all that we might first honour him and then be honoured by him how therefore ought wee in way of thankfulnes for the great worke of our redemption glorifie him and aduance his honour but in stead hereof many euen of those that professe christ dishonour him vsing him as a packhorse to lay vpon him all their sinnes and so lade him with their sinnes past and crucifie him againe with daily new sinnes and yet they looke he should be their sauiour to bring them to honour and immortall glorie the inducements follow the first of which is take from the power of christ vnto him who i able ampc that wee may know the force of this reason wee will first consider what this power of christ is the power of christ is two fold first absolute secondly actuall by absolute i vnderstand that power of his whereby hee is able to doe euen that which he will neuer do of which john baptist speaketh god is able euen of stones to raise vp seede to abraham by this power god could haue made many thousand worlds whereas he made but one and by the same christ could haue commanded a legion of angels to haue deliuered him from the hands of the iewes but would not this absolute power goeth beyond his actuall power or will yet is not greater than his will for as what god doth that he willeth so what hee can doe hee can also will but this power is not here meant the second namely the actuall power of christ is whereby hee doth and effecteth whatsoeuer he willeth and it is of two sorts first his generall power which tendeth on his prouidence whereby he ordereth all things both in heauen and earth psalm our god is in heauen and doth whatsoeuer he will secondly a more speciall power which accompanieth his grace and alwaies goeth with it of which paul speaketh ephesian that we may know what is the exceeding greatnes of his power towards vs that beleeue according to the working of his mightie power of this power working life and grace to them which beleeue iud here speaketh concerning which obserue three conclusions first that this power is giuen to christ in time matth all power is giuen me in heauen and in earth acts he is of god made lord and christ importing that this power is giuen him to bee a lord indeed the son of god as god is of equall power with the father and that from all eternitie in which regard no power can be giuen him but if we respect his office of mediation to the performance of which he must lay aside his power and become as a servant subiecting himselfe to the death thus this power may bee said to bee giuen him againe namely when by his rising from the dead and ascending into heauen hee was mightely declared to bee the son of god so that in psalm thou article my son this day haue i begotten thee is in acts applied to the resurrection of christ as if hee had said this day haue i made manifest by thy powerfull resurrection that thou article my son and that i haue begotten thee before all world the second conclusion is that this power is manifested in christ the head especially namely when it caused him so victoriously to ouercome death in suffering it to rise from the graue ascend to heauen amp sit at the right hand of god his father paul prayeth that the ephesians might know the greatnes of this power which raised christ from the dead and set him at god right hand in heauenly places ephesian the third conclusion that this power conueyeth it selfe from christ the head to all his members ephesian to him that is able to doe abundantly aboue all that we aske or thinke according to the power that worketh in vs coloss i also labour and striue according to his working which worketh in me mightely now being conueied vnto the members of christ it is not idle in them or vnprofitable but worketh proportionably in them al as it did in christ himselfe for as it caused christ to die for our sinnes so it maketh vs die to our owne sinnes as this power made him to liue againe to his father so it maketh vs his members to liue vnto god that as hee by vertue hereof rose againe so it causeth vs to rise to a new life in this life and to our eternall life in the life to come further this power is commended here by foure effects first it is able to keepe them that they fall not namely into manifest sinnes ioyned with obstinacie for of such sinnes and sinners hee had spoken in the former words and cannot be meant of euery kinde of fall seeing the children of god fall daily but of such as dauid prayed against psalm last keepe thy servant from presumptuous sins let them not raigne ouer me the second effect is to present you faultlesse that is first to iustifie beleeuers secondly to sanctifie them here in part while they liue and in death to finish and perfect that inchoate sanctification the third effect in the day of iudgment to present them before the presence of his glorie the fourth effect with ioy that is to possesse them with ioy euerlasting vse in that christ is able to keepe them that beleeue wee may note that this his power doth order the wils of beleeuers both in and after their conuersion in their conuersion it frameth and turneth their wils ioh no man commeth to the son except the father draw him that is except he incline and turne mans will vnto his owne and make it of an vnwilling will a willing will againe after conuersion it is not an idle power in them ioh he that is borne of god sinneth not that is addicteth not himselfe nor setteth himselfe to the practise of sinne and the reason is giuen because the seed of god remaineth in him which is all one with this power which is able and accordingly keepeth him whereby that popish error is detected namely that in the conuersion of a sinner it is in mans power and will either to receiue or resist the grace of god and that mans will can either applie it selfe to grace offered if it will or else refuse it but if this were true the power of god should not order mans will but mans will should order god grace yes and ouercome this omnipotent power of god againe this ouerthroweth the distinction of grace into sufficient and effectuall for sufficient grace is effectuall seeing that this power of christ waiteth vpon it to make it effectuall secondly hence wee see that this power of christ in his members is a continued power neuer wholy interrupted for it keepeth them in this life that they fall not into presumptuous sinnes secondly it iustifieth them and sanctifieth them imperfectly in life and perfectly in death thirdly after death it presenteth them vnto their glorie fourthly after the last iudgement it possesseth them with vnspeakable ioy thus the righteous man by vertue of this power becomes like a tree whose leafe neuer faileth nor fadeth psalm and hence is it that hope is said to be a sure anchor hebr verse for this propertie hath it not from it selfe as also loue and faith in themselues are changeable and nothing indeede is in it selfe vnchangeable but god but the power of christ is it that maketh it an anchor sure and stedfast by which consideration those two vncomfortable errors are confuted first that the childe of god being regenerate may fall maliciously and euen wholy away secondly that hee may fall finally seeing god putteth his hand vnder and this power of christ is able to keep them that they fall not though fearefully they may yet neither wholy nor finally thirdly we must labour to haue experience of this power of christ in our selues working in our heart the death of our sins and quickning them againe vnto the life of grace and of god for this power of christ consisteth not in any fancie but in n effectuall feeling in the heart of euery true beleeuer paul prayed that the ephesians might feele in themselues this proportionall power to christ his power in his death and resurrection ephesian himselfe counted all things ng in comparison of the knowledge of this power philipp and that he might haue experience hereof hee will reioyce in his owne weakenes corinthian and what will this power be profitable vnto vs be it neuer so powerfull in it selfe vnlesse we finde our selues thus strengthened in grace and godlines by it fourthly wee may not content our selues with a forme and shew of godlines but stri to attaine the power of it or else let vs neuer professe christ and please our selues only in such a profession for whosoeuer is truly christs in him this power worketh mightely in subduing in striuing against temptations in stirring vp zeale of god glorie and in a word in making man fruitfull and abundant in all well doing yes it can no more hide it selfe where it is than can the sun at noone day but it will cause man to shine as lights in the middest of a froward generation which and effects if a man cannot finde in himself let him suspect himselfe that he is not as yet knit vnto christ for then hee would bee by vertue of this power in some proportion conformable vnto him fifthly th doctrine ministreth a stay and prop to our faith and hope seeing that christ th such a working power as this is whereby hee is able to make good and accomplish whatsoeuer hee hath promised concerning our salua ion thus he stregthened his disciples ioh but be of good comfort i haue the world and thus abraham beleeued aboue hope because he kn w that god was able to performe what hee had promised rom teaching all the son of a thfull abraham vp what prop they are to and stay vp themselues the promises are delaied here the papist eacheth that in regard of god indeed and his promise we may beleeue our owne saluation but in respect of our selues and in regard of our owne indisposition we must still doubt and it is presumption saith he to beleeue it answer but this is false for wee must not doubt in regard of our own indisposition but must certainly by faith lay hold on our own saluation seeing that christ by his power correcteth yes and abolisheth in his members this indisposition fitting them notwithstanding it and keeping them vnto life eternall sixthly and lastly we must striue to become like vnto christ seeing y e same power that was in him is conueied and deriued from him into euery one of his members that as hee liued in obedience vnto his father both doing and suffering whatsoeuer his father enioyned and willed euen so ought we look what was his disposition and conuersation whilest hee conuersed here vpon earth so ought wee to be disposed and conuerse resembling him in meekenes humilitie patience loue towards our father and brother yes and towards our enemy and as hee was minded the same minde ought also to be in vs philipp so much for the first reason moouing vs to the praise of christ drawne from his power the second motiue is in the verse to god onely wise drawne from his wisedome wherein three things are to bee obserued first that christ is god secondly that he is wise thirdly that he is only wise for the first this is a notable testimonie and to bee obserued against the arrians amp atheists to confirme the diuinitie of christ who like dogs most blasphemously with blacke mouthes barke against their creator affirming him to bee one of the great seducers of the world against whom that we may bee the better armed i will first propound one or two euident reasons and then answere their allegations the first argument consider that whosoeuer haue taken vpon themselues to be called god the iust iudgement and vengeance of god hath befallen them and they haue been destroyed by the hand of god adam and eue because they would haue been but like god or as god were grieuously punished in themselues and all their posteritie herod because hee was contented that the people should call him god the hand of god was instantly vpon him and the angell of god smot him and hee was eaten vp of lice but christ professed himselfe to bee god yes and disputed ioh against the pharisies that he was the son of god and yet no harme befell him nay he proued manifestly by his doctrine and miracles by his death and glorious resurrection that he spoke true when he said he was god and the son of god the second reason christ wrought miracles which could not be done either by naturall or satanicall power as to raise the dead to make them which were borne blind to see and these by a diuine and omnipotent power and not as an instrument but as an author of them and therfore he was true god now if they alleadge here that wee haue no proofe hereof but out of the new testament which they reject as they doe the other scriptures i answer that many of the same things in effect are extant also euen in heathen writers themselues ob but they alleage against the diuinitie of christ that christ is inferiour vnto god ioh the father is greater than i corinthian god is the head of christ as the man is the womans head and chap the son shall be subiect vnto him that subdued all things vnder him but as none is aboue god so god is inferiour to none and therefore christ is not god ans the two former places must bee vnderstood of christ as hee is man and mediatour which hindreth not but that as he is god he is equall to the father the third place in corinthian must be thus vnderstood that the son is made eternally subiect vnto the father not as hee is god but in regard of his humanitie secondly of his mysticall bodie that is the church so as this subiection amp inferioritie of christ is nothing else but a manifestation of the difference of christ as hee is man and as he is god and of the inferioritie of his manhood to the godhead which shall bee especially reuelled at the day of iudgement the second obiection acts the it is a more blessed thing to giue than to receiue but christ receiueth wisedome life yes and his substance from his father and so the father is more blessed than he ans that place speaketh of such a receiuing as presupposeth want which is more miserable than to bee able to giue which argueth plentie and abundance but christ receiueth not thus his substance wisedome and life for he neuer wanted them when he receiued them he had them and hauing them hee receiued them and both had and receiued them before all worlds and so that allegation is to no purpose the third obiection christ is a mediatour and prayeth vnto god and so hee is not god for nothing prayeth to it s lfe answer christ is directly a mediatour to the father the first person in trinitie now because the person haue all one nature and will therefore he is also mediatour euen to himselfe as the second person as also to the holy ghost let vs bee still armed against these wicked ellbounds and detest their satanicall delusions and such damnable doctrine derogatorie to the honour of the son of god the second point in this second reason is that christ is wise this wisdome of christ is a propertie common to him with the father and holy ghost wherby he perfectly knoweth all things as they are concerning which remember these eight things first that this wisedome of christ is of it selfe and hath the beginning from it selfe and not from any other for though he receiueth it from the father yet it is all one with the fathers and therefore it is not begotten nor proceedeth from any but is the fountains of all wisedom in the creatures me or angels secondly we by our wisedom conceiue things by formes and app rances presented to our mindes but christ he knoweth all things by the things themselues and not by any representations thereof he needeth no helpe from the thing it selfe to conceiue of it as we doe thirdly we know and conceiue of things by sense and discourse but christ doth this by one simple act of nderstanding fourthly this wisedome of god is all one with god himselfe for his wisedome is his substance in man and angels it is not so but a qualitie distinct from their substances fifthly this wisedome is infinite for hereby god knoweth both himselfe and all other things past present or to come things good and bad things that are and things which are not yes the very motions and thoughts of the heart sixtly this is alwaies a certaine and infallible knowledge neuer coniecturall as ours is seuenthly it is most perfect both because it doth not onely know some things but there is nothing which it knoweth not as also because nothing can be added vnto it nor detracted fro it in all which it differeth from ours eighthly it is a distinct wisedome seeing god knoweth not in grosse and confusedly all things but distinguisheth euery particular thing and action euen as they are hee knoweth euery haire of our heads and the places thereof euery lighting of a sparrow vpon the ground the consideration of which points sheweth the admirable greatnes of this wisedome of christ the third point is that he is only wise where is not excluded the wisedome of the father and holy ghost but all the wisedome of al creatures as ioh this is life eternall to know thee the only god where the son and holy ghost may not bee excluded ob but some will say the creatures haue wisedome and so the son is not only wise ans the wisedome of the creatures is but a created wisedome god is onely wise by a wisedome vncreated theirs is but an image and shadow of this yes compared thereunto it is no wisedome at al so as still god may be said to be onely wise vse seeing christ is affirmed to be god note that his death although it was but momentarie and short in time yet it was of endlesse merit quest but how can this be that a short death of so few houres should counteruaile the eternall torment due to sinne ans the person that died being god the dignitie of the person counteruaileth the eternitie of the punishment so as the son of god suffring although it was not for halfe a day it was as much as if all man had died for euer so infinite and endlesse it was though not in time yet in merit and efficacie vse seeing christ hath such an absolute wisedome distinctly knowing all things wee are taught to feare amp tremble before him doing all things as in his presence he beholdeth vs with all our actions there is not a word in our tongue but hee knoweth it wholy yes he vnderstandeth our thoughts and that a farre off see psalm vse such as are in distresse resting themselues vpon god mercie in christ may herein stay and vphold themselues with this comfort that christ is god and able to relieue them yes hee is the only wise god and therefore hee knoweth all their miseries distinctly he knoweth how farre foorth it is good for them to suffer how to turne their suffering to the best vnto them as also the best and fittest time when to deliuer them seasonably out of their trouble and therefore patiently commit thy selfe into his hand and reli thy selfe vpon him as on a mercifull redeemer vse if christ bee only wise then we must take counsell of him and learne wisedome of him learne of me if it be asked how shal we learne of him seeing he is in heauen i answere hee hath left his word with vs in the scriptures there we may learne his wisedom there we may haue his directions if it bee asked what is the summe of that counsell there contained i answere it standeth in the hearing and doing of his commandements to which three things are required first to beleeue on him and depend vpon him alone for saluation secondly to turne vnfainedly withall our hearts vnto him thirdly to obey him in our liues and conuersations this is the right wisedome for the teaching of which wisedome her selfe vttereth her voyce and calleth to the children of man prouerbs verse the third reason is taken from the worke of our redemption in the words our sauiour the which reason that we may rightly vnderstand foure points are to be propounded first what kind of sauiour christ is ans he must bee conceiued first a perfect sauiour sauing perfectly all that are saued heb he is able to saue perfectly all that come vnto him yes hee perfectly saueth by himself and not by any other creature whosoeuer attaine to saluation for this also is required vnto his perfection rom whom god hath set out to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood hebr by himselfe hee hath purged our sinnes where note an error in the church of rome which teacheth that christ did by his death merit that we might by our owne works merit saluation but this is false christ saueth not man by man or by any creature but by himselfe yes he should not so be a sauiour but an instrument by whom we must saue our selues secondly hece wee learne to acknowledge him an alone sauiour without any fellow partner or deputy acts there is no other name vnder heauen giuen to saue vs but the name of christ and if hee haue any partner he is but halfe a sauiour hence wee see that the romane religion although in word it honour christ yet in deede it denieth him in ioyning to christs all sufficient satisfaction others satisfactions and so likewise they ioyne to his sacrifice vpon the crosse their sacrifices in their masse to his meritorious intercession the intercession of the virgin mary and other saints and that not by way of request but of the merit of their intercession thus they set vp many sauiours in stead of this our perfect and alone sauiour the second point is from what danger doth he saue vs ans saluation euer implieth perdition so saluation by christ implieth endlesse destruction which is the thing from which he doth saue vs in which endlesse perditio note first the foundation of it that is our sins noted in the exposition of his name mat he shall saue his people from their sinnes secondly the degrees which are three first in this life a subiection to all kindes of miseries inward and outward in soule bodie goods name in our selues and others secondly in the end of this life death being in it self a curse and an entrance into hell thirdly after the first the second death which is euerlasting destruction in hell fire for euer now christ is a sauiour to saue and free vs both from this foundation our sins themselues as also from the degrees from the bondage to satan by sinne secondly from the first death so far forth as it is a curse thirdly from the second death and euerlasting destruction the third point is how doth christ saue man ans according to that order which god hath set downe in the couenant not of workes but of grace wherein god promiseth to giue christ with all his merits and graces to euery beleeuer now according to the tenour of this couenant first christ with his merits is giuen vnto the beleeuer hee againe is giuen vnto christ by vertue of which donation a man may say christ is mine his benefits are mine also as truly and as surely as my land is my owne hereupon to make this mutuall donation effectuall followeth a second thing which is the vnion of vs with him by the bond of the spirit and this is a mysticall but a true vnion whereby he that is giuen vnto christ is made one with him after this commeth a third thing which is a communication of christ himselfe and all his benefits vnto beleeuers this is done two waies first by way of imputation which is an accounting and accepting of his obedience and sufferings as ours for the discharge of our sinnes and acquiting vs from them secondly by a kinde of propagation whereby grace is deriued from his grace and infused into those that are set into him for as many candles receiue light from one great torch or light and as many streames flow from one fountain or head spring and as from one roote proceed many branches euen so al his members drink of his fountaines are enriched by his treasures of wisedome and knowledge yes indeed amp liue by no other life than that which by his spirit hee inspireth into the faces of their soules and hereby he sheweth himselfe to bee a roote euen that roote of iesse and that second adam conueying vnto all his branches righteousnes and life as the first adam being a roote also deriued corruption from himself to al his posteritie springing and arising from him so is that place corinthian to be vnderstood he is made of god to vs wisedome righteousnes sanctification and redemption because he is the root and fountaine of all these graces vnto vs of whose fulnes wee receiue them the fourth point is of whom is christ a sauiour answer our sauiour that is a sauiour of the catholique church ephesians the sauiour of his bodie that is his church more plainly the persons that are to be saued by him are such as truly beleeue in him and testifie their faith by their conuersion vnto god and forsaking their sins for the euidence whereof consider two things first that it is most necessarie that the person that is to be saued should be thus qualified if hee bee of yeeres for with infants it is otherwise for ma ke the order prescribed to be obserued in the word and sacraments in which god requireth in the first place repentance and faith and then afterwards maketh promise of saluation by christ luke that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his name repentance for sinne must goe before remission of sinne acts repent and be baptized there is the first for remission of sinnes there is the second this is the rather to be obserued because many go preposterously to worke beginning there where god endeth comforting themselues in their sauiour and in the promises of life by his meanes but let goe faith and repentance at least deferre them this is the cause of much wickednes and a false comfort not fetched from that order which is appointed by god secondly those who bring the beginnings of faith and repentance if so be the beginning be true constant and still increasing to these christ becommeth a sauiour matth christ came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance that is those who acknowledge themselues to bee sinners confessing and forsaking their sinnes and not such as presume of their owne righteousnes matth i am sent to the lost sheepe of the house of israel euen those who in their owne iudgement are lost who are in the mouth of the lion and in all mans iudgement lost isai the well of water of life is promised to all those that thirst that is such as want water and long after the welsprings of it and wish after nothing so much isai a bruised reede he will not breake the smoking flaxe he will not quench euen small beginnings of grace be they neuer so weake nor feeble so they be true he despiseth not thus are the persons to bee qualified vnto whom christ will become a sauiour now because all man are not thus disposed it followeth that redemption and the worke of saluation is not vniuersall vse first the multitude of our people are iustly blamed as enemy of christ for if they bee asked how they look to be saued they answere by their good seruing of god and their iust and honest dealing among man now this their seruing of god is but to repeate ouer the tenne commandements the creed and the lord prayer and their good dealing is but to deceiue no man or not to offer them open iniurie and here they stay themselues not all this while euer looking after christ as man not standing in neede of him or of his righteousnesse but set vp themselues for their owne sauiours and know not any other way to life then their owne which carrieth them from christ secondly wee are taught to conceiue of christ as of our sauiour which wee shall doe if wee bee touched with the sense of our sinne and danger by it and with the neede wee haue of his most precious blood which will cause vs to prise it aboue the most precious things which the world can conteine when our hartes are thus affected then wee conceiue of him as we ought thirdly wee must carrie our selues as persons saued alreadie by christ for he is a sauiour vnto vs euen in this life and our saluation is begun and is in part here this we doe when wee ioyne with the profession of faith a true conuersion vnto god reasons hereof first because regeneration although it bee no cause yet it is a part of our saluation for by it a man is freed from the corruption of his sinne in part which whosoeuer looketh for remission of sinnes must atteine vnto secondly whomsoeuer christ saueth from hell he first saueth them from their sinnes he redeemeth man not only from deserued condemnation but also their vaine conuersation if the thou wouldest know whether christ hath saued thee from hell or no looke into thy selfe and trie whether his death hath wrought the death of sinne in thee or no for if thou article not turned from sin thou article not saued from hell thirdly to whomsoeuer christ is a sauiour by merit to him he is a sauiour by efficacie also for he is a sauiour both these waies by the former he procureth pardon of sin by the latter hee turneth the heart of the sinner from sin vnto god this if it bee wanting there can be no true assurance of the other lastly the saluation of a sinner standeth not in the fruition of riches honours wealth or deliuerance from the miseries of this life but properly in righteousnes and life eternall the recompece of the same which fruite whosoeuer would reape he must sow the seedes thereof in righteousnesse and cease from hencefoorth to be the servant of sinne the third generall point in this conclusion is the praise of christ it selfe in the last verse be glory and maiestie and dominion and power both now and for euer amen which words cotaine the forme of the praise of god and christ where foure things are to be considered first what bee the things that are here ascribed to christ and they be foure first glorie by which wee are to vnderstand an infinit and incomprehensible excellecie wherby christ excelleth all things that euer were are or euer shall be now as there be in god two things distinct first essence which is the godhead it selfe simply considered secondly person as father son holy ghost so accordingly the glorie of god is two fold first the glorie of essence secondly the glorie of person the glorie of essence is the godhead it selfe or god himselfe who is glorie it selfe or the excellencie of the diuine attributes is the glorie of god rom that which may be knowne of god is his wisedome glorie power iustice and mercie and verse they turned the glorie of the incorruptible god ampc whatsoeuer therefore that may be knowne of god is a part of his glorie exodus moses desireth the lord that he would let him see his glorie the lord answered him thou canst not see my face and liue where to see the face of god and his glorie is all one and so of all diuine attributes the glorie of the persons is distinct from the other as the persons themselues are by their personall proprieties as the fathers glorie is to beget the son the sonnes glory is to be begotten of the father the holy ghosts is to proceed from them both thus heb christ is called the brightnes of the glorie and the ingrauen forme of his fathers person ioh we saw the glorie thereof as the glorie of the onely begotten son of the father both these are here to bee vnderstood both which are incomprehensible and therefore our care must be to walke by faith whereby wee may attaine vnto it rather than more curiously to seeke to comprehend the knowledge of it the second thing attributed to christ is maiestie whereby we are to vnderstand that highnes amp greatnes of god and christ whereby he is in himselfe in his workes and euery way wonderfull luke whe christ had wrought a famous miracle of casting out a diuell it is said they were all amazed at the mightie power of god the third thing is dominion which word properly signifieth power and authoritie and by consequent dominion as the second word translated power signifieth properly dominion but it commeth all to one by dominion is meant an absolute power and soueraigntie in gouerning and commaunding all creatures the fourth thing is power which signifieth that absolute might of god whereby hee doth whatsoeuer he will here by the way wee must obserue that of these foure glorie is the chiefest the other three are but as parts of his glorie and are added to make a description of his glorie for the glorie of god is herein manifest in that he is full of maiestie dominion and power the second thing to be obserued is that these foure are giuen to christ alone for the word only must be referred to the whole sentence the father and holie ghost not being excluded thereby but all false and idoll god the third thing is the time of praise now and for euer for there is no time wherein it is not to be expressed the fourth thing is the affection which is euer to be vsed in the praising of christ in the word amen that is verely or so be it signifying that the affection of the heart must euer be ioyned with this religious action of the praise of god vse first wee learne hence that wee are bound to giue praise and glorie to god and christ psalm o god praise waiteth for thee in sion it is one of his rights properly due vnto him corinthian whether wee eate or drinke or whatsoeuer we doe it must all be done to his glorie secondly looke what is god principall end in all his actions that ought to bee ours in our actions but his principall end of all his actions is his owne glory prou the lord made all things for himselfe that is for his glories sake which end wee also must aime at in all our actions thirdly the end of al god blessings is to mooue vs to set out the vertues of god pet which is then done of vs when with our mouth wee confesse and in our liues we expresse his mercie wisedome power and such other his properties fourthly that wee may not thinke that this is an arbitrarie dutie left to our owne libertie or put in our owne power whether we will performe it or not wee must know that it sitteth neere or ought to sit neere vs and is a case of necessitie to preferre the glorie of god before our liues yes before the saluation of our soules in the lord prayer we are taught first to pray for the glorie of god simply without any respect to ourselues and afterwards come to the petitions concerning our selues and others ob but here it will be said god is the fulnes amp perfection of all glorie how can we then adde any glorie vnto him ans the glory of god is taken two waies first for that infinite glorie which is in himselfe or rather which is himselfe to the perfection of which nothing can bee added neither can any thing bee detracted from it to make it lesse perfect secondly for that glorie of his which is in and from vs the which is nothing else but the acknowledging confessing and praising of this his glory in which sense we may bee said to giue him glorie or not to giue it ob but it may be alleaged that god being the perfection of glorie in himselfe he needeth not glory or praise from vs and therefore the dutie is not so absolute necessarie ans our praise of god is not needfull in regard of god psalm o lord my goodnes extendeth not vnto thee but it is needfull in regard of our selues being creatures and in this respect bound to honor and glorifie our creator secondly because although it is not his happines yet it is our chiefe good and happines to praise him thus are we to take knowledge of our maine dutie and on the contrarie of our maine sinne who herein haue so often failed dishonouring the lord by our wicked thoughts speeches and actions and that continually and so haue robbed him of his glorie for whose glorie alone we were created vse in this forme of praise obserue the foundation of all diuine and religious worship all which may be referred vnto foure heads first adoration the ground whereof is god maiestie and glorie for it followeth well if god be full of maiestie and glorie then wee must adore him wee must submit our selues before him wee must subiect our consciences to his lawes wee must beleeue all his promises and tremble at al his threatnings secondly faith the ground of which is god dominion and power for if he be the soueraigne lord of life and death if hee haue such absolute power to saue and destroy then must wee place all our faith in him for our saluation thirdly prayer and fourthly thanksgiuing both which hath their grounds and foundation in his power dominion and glorie so in the lord prayer after the petitions is added as the ground of prayer the reason of all the requests for thine is kingdome power and glorie vse hence wee must learne to adore and reuerece the iudgements and workes of god howsoeuer they seeme vnto vs and may bee harsh in our shallow reason for he is glorie it selfe maiestie it selfe power it selfe and he worketh that for his owne glorie which we cannot comprehend if god therefore loue iacob and hate esau for nothing seene in themselues but because he will so doe which might seeme to the eye of flesh a thing vniust and partiall let vs stop our mouthes at this most righteous iudgement of god for he is all power and dominion hauing soueraigntie and absolute lordship ouer al his creatures to make some vessels of honour and some of dishonour some of mercie and some of wrath all man being as the clay in the hand of the potter amp therefore the apostle rom so soone as hee had propounded this famous and memoriall example to shut the mouthes of man which otherwise would haue been opened against this iust and incomprehensible proceeding of god he brought them presently to the consideration of the power and soueraigntie of god verse we our selues think it no iniustice to kill the creatures because god hath giuen vs a lordship and dominion ouer them and shall we denie it to bee iust in god to destroy likewise his creature ouer which hee hath infinitely more soueraigntie than man hath ouer them vse we are to be afraide to sinne against god we must resigne our will vnto his whatsoeuer it is and simplie subiect our selues vnto the obedience of the same fearing in the least thing to offend him and all this because of his maiestie power and dominion ouer vs for this is the liuing holy and acceptable sacrifice which he requireth of vs rom euen our reasonable seruing of him further whereas all these are to bee giuen to god alone note first that the wicked astrologer with his arte is here condemned seeing all glorie is properly belonging vnto god but the astrologer arrogateth to himselfe that part of god glorie which consisteth in the foreknowledge of things to come in that by erecting of a figure and the aspect of the starres he takes vpon him to foretel things meerely casuall and contingent as of life and death woe or wealth peace or war wherein he entreth vpon god possessions isai besides that the starres neither by creation nor by any ordinance of god can bee any meanes to foretell things to come secondly detestible is the roman doctrine which giueth the glorie and power of god to saints as of hearing the prayers of all man in all places and knowing the hearts secondly it giueth to the pope power to make lawes and to binde the conscience thirdly it ascribeth to the pope amp hi shauelings power to forgiue sins properly all which bee incommunicable properties of the godhead now for the time for euer learne that it is the duty of euery child of god to dedicate himselfe vnto the praise of god and that continually psalm for this shall be the eternall c ling and condition of those who shall possesse the kingdome of glorie and must be begun euen in this life lastly from the affection in the word amen note that whatsoeuer wee are to performe in the seruice of god must bee not of fashion but with the earnest affection of our hearts psalme my soule praise the lord and all that is within me praise his holy name it is said of iosias that hee turned to god with all his soule and all his heart according to all the law of moses so wee in like manner in our conuersion to god in our prayers praise or whatsoeuer holy worship and seruice we tender vnto him must beware lest in drawing neere him with our lips wee withd w our hearts from him which wee shall the better performe if we carry in mind his owne commandement my son giue me thy heart

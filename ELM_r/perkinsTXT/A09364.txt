in that part of the prophecie which goes before the holy ghost setteth downe amp foretelleth the calling of the gentiles which was to begin at the death of christ and from thence to continue vnto this day and so consequently to the ende of the world in the former verses of this chapter there is mention made of the rejection of the iewes i meane not a generall but a particular rejection namely then when they were in affliction in the daies of isaiah now in this and so in all other prophecies of the like kind which intreat of this point christ himselfe is brought in speaking in his owne person and the words of this chapter from the beginning to this present verse and the rest that follow are the words of christ the mediatour in the verses going before he disputes the case of their reiection and the summe of the whole disputation is that either he or they themselues were the causes thereof but he was not the cause and therefore they themselues by their sinnes the reason whereby he prooues that they themselues were the cause is framed in this sort you iewes cannot bring any writing or bill of diuorce to shew that i reiected you therefore i appeale euen to your owne consciences whether you haue not brought this iudgement vpon your selues by your iniquities verse on the other side the reason why god was not the cause is because he for his part called them in great mercie and loue but when he called they would not obey ver now in the ende of the second verse is contained an answer to a secret reply that some obstinate iewe might make after this manner god hath no nowe the like power in sauing and deliuering vs as he hath had in former times therefore we cannot hope or expect any deliuerance from him and howe then shall we doe in the meane while to this the lord himselfe makes answere ver that his hand is not shortned not his power lessened in regard of greater workes much lesse in respect of their deliuerance and though the present affliction which they indured was great and tedious yet they were not to be ouermuch dismaied in themselues but rather to be comforted because god had giuen him the tongue of the learned to minister a word in season to the wearie and distressed and consequently that he had power to ease amp refresh that their wearines and affliction in this text then there is set downe one principall dutie of christs propheticall office by allusion to the practises of the prophets in the olde testament especially those which belonged to the schooles of elijah and elizeus who are here tearmed the learned and out of the words thereof one speciall point of instruction may be gathered namely that there is a certaine knowledge or doctrine reuealed in the word of god whereby the consciences of the weake may be rectified and pacified i gather it thus it was one speciall dutie of christs propheticall office to giue comfort to the consciences of those that were distressed as the prophet here recordeth now as christ had this power to execute and performe such a dutie so he hath committed the dispensation thereof to the ministers of the gospell for we may not thinke that christ in his owne person ministred and spake words of comfort to the wearie in the times of the prophets because he was not then exhibited in our nature and yet he did then speake but how in the persons of the prophets so likewise because christ nowe in the new testament speaks not vnto the afflicted in his owne proper person it remaineth therefore that he performes this great work in the ministerie of pastours and teachers vpon earth to whome he hath giuen knowledge and other gifts to this ende and purpose there must needs therefore be a certaine and infallible doctrine propounded amp taught in the scriptures whereby the consciences of man distressed may be quieted and releeued and this doctrine is not attained vnto by extraordinarie reuelation but must be drawne out of the written word of god the point therefore to be handled is what this doctrine should be it is not a matter easie and at hand but full of labour and difficultie yes very large like vnto the maine sea i will onely as it were walke by the bankes of it and propound the heads of doctrine that thereby i may at least occasion others to consider and handle the same more at large that i may proceede in order first i am to lay downe certaine grounds or preambles which may giue light amp direction to the things that followe and in the next place i will propound and answer the maine amp principall questions of conscience the grounds or preambles are especially foure the first touching confession the second touching the degrees of goodnesse in things and actions the third touching the degrees of sinne the fourth and last concerning the subiection and power of conscience of these in order the first ground is that in the troubles of conscience it is meete and conuenient there should alwaies be vsed a priuate confession for iames saith confesse your faults one to another and pray one for another thereby signifying that confession in this case is to be vsed as a thing most requisite for in all reason the physitian must first knowe the disease before he can apply the remedie and the griefe of the heart will not be discerned vnlesse it be manifested by the confession of the partie diseased and for this cause also in the griefe of conscience the scruple that is the thing that troubleth the conscience must be knowne neuerthelesse in priuate confession these caueats must be obserued first priuate confession must not be vrged as a thing simply or absolutely necessarie without which there can be no saluation againe it is not fit that confession should be of all sinnes but onely of the scruple it selfe that is of that or those sinnes alone which doe trouble and molest the conscience thirdly though confession may be made to any kinde of man confesse one to another saith iames yet is it especially to be made to the prophets and ministers of the gospel for they in likelyhood of all other man in respect of their places and gifts are the fittest and best able to instruct correct comfort and enforme the weake and the wounded conscience lastly the person to whome it is made must be a man of trust and fidelitie able amp willing to keepe secret things that are reueiled yes to bu ie them as it were in the graue of obliuion for loue couereth amultitude of sinnes the next ground is touching the degrees of goodnes in humane things and actions goodnesse in things is twofold vncreated and created vncreated is god himselfe who neuer had beginning and who is goodnesse it selfe because his nature is absolutely and perfectly good and because he is the author and worker thereof in all things created created goodnes is that whereby the creature is made good and it is nothing else but the fruit of that goodnesse that is essentially in god now the degrees therof are these there is a generall or naturall goodnesse in creatures and a more speciall or morall goodnesse generall goodnesse is that whereby all creatures are accepted and approoued of god by whome they were both created and ordained thus euery creature is good partly by creation and partly by ordination by creation it is that the substance of each creature as of the sun the moone the earth water meate drinke ampc is good hauing the beeing thereof fro god hence also the essentiall properties quantities qualities motions actions and inclinations of the creatures in themselues considered with all their euents are good by the same generall goodnesse also euen the deuill himself and his actions as he is a substance and as they are actions hauing their beeing from god are good things againe doe take vnto them the condition of goodnesse not onely by creation but also by god ordination whereby they are directed and appointed to some certen vses and endes thus the evil conscience hel amp death are good because they are ordained of god for the execution of his iustice howsoeuer in themselues and to vs they be euill besides this generall and naturall goodnesse there is also a speciall or morall goodnesse properly so called and it is that which is agreeable to the eternall and vnchangeable wisdome of god reuealed in the morall lawe wherein it is commaunded and things as they are therein commanded to be done by god are good morally nowe of actions morally good there be two degrees for they are either good in themselues alone or good both in theselues and in the doer in themselues alone some things be morally good for example when a wicked man giues almes it is a good worke onely in it selfe but not good in the doer because it is not done in saith and from a good conscience and so are all the vertues of the heathen morally good in themselues but they are not good in heathen me for in them they are but splendida pecc beautifull sinnes the next degree of goodnesse is whereby things and actions are both good in theselues and in the doer also of this sort were the praiers amp almes of cornelius good in themselues amp in him also because he was a beleeuer now opposite to things and actonis morally good or euill are actions and things of a middle nature commonly tearmed indifferent which in themselues beeing neither good nor euill may be done or not done without sinne in themselues i say for in their circumstances they are and may be made either euill or good and here we must remember to put a difference betweene conueniencie and inconuenience which ariseth from the nature of indifferent things conueniencie is when a thing or action is so fitted to the circumstances and the circumstances fitted to it that thereby it becomes a thing conuenient on the otherside inconuenience is when the thing or action is done in vnmeete circumstances which bring some hurt or losse to the outward man or stand not with decencie and therefore doe make it to be inconuenient and by this that hath beene said we may discerne when an action is good euill indifferent conuenient or inconuenient the third ground is touching the degrees or differences of sinne and here we must first of all search what is sinne properly and what is properly a sinner sinne in his proper nature as s john saith is an anomie that is a want of conformitie to the law of god for the better vnderstanding whereof we must know that there were in adam before his fall three things not to be seuered one from the other the substance of his bodie and of his soule the faculties and powers of his bodie and soule and the image of god consisting in a straightnes and conformitie of all the affections and powers of man to god will nowe when adam falls and sinnes against god what is his sinne not the want of the two former for they both remained but the very want and absence of the third thing namely of conformitie to god will i make it plaine by this resemblance in a musicall instrument there is to be considered not onely the instrument it selfe and the sound of the instrument but also the harmonie in the sound nowe the contrarie to harmonie or the disorder in musicke is none of the two former but the third namely the discord which is the want or absence of harmonie which we call disharmonie in the same manner the sinne of adam is not the absence either of the substance or of the faculties of the soule and the bodie but the want of the third thing before named amp that is conformitie or correspondencie to the will of god in regard of obedience but some may say the want of conformitie in the powers of the soule is not sinne properly because in sinne there must be not onely an absence of goodnesse but an habite or presence of euill i answer that this very want of conformitie is not onely the absence of goodnesse but also the habite or presence of euill for as this want enters in and is receiued into mans nature it is properly a want or absence of goodnesse againe after it is receiued into the nature of man it continues and abides in the powers and faculties thereof and so it caries the name of an habit it may be said againe that lust and concupiscence that is originall sinne drawes the heart away from the seruice of god and entises it to euill now to entise or drawe away is an action and this action cannot proceede of a meere priuation or want ans we must consider sinne two waies first ioyntly with the thing or subiect in which it is secondly by it selfe in his owne nature if we consider it with his subiect it is an euill inclination or action but if we consider it in it owne nature it is no inclination or action but a want for example in a murther we must consider two things one is the action of moouing the bodie and of holding vp the weapon ampc which is no sinne properly if it be considered as an action because euery action comes from god who is the first cause of all things and actions againe in murther there is a second thing namely the killing or slaying of the man which is the disorder or aberration in the action whereby it is disposed to a wrong vse and end and thus the action is a sinne namely in respect it wants conformitie to the will of god the nature then of the sinne lies not in the action but in the manner of doing the action and sinne properly is nothing formally subsisting or existing for then god should be the author of it in as much as he is the creatour and ordainer of euery thing and action but it is an ataxie or absence of goodnes and vprightnes in the thing that subsisteth therefore it is well and truly said in schooles in sinne there is nothing positiue but it is a want of that which ought to be or subsist partly in the nature of man and partly in the actions of nature thus we see what sinne is the second thing to be considered is what is a sinner properly for the knowledge hereof we must consider in euery sinne foure things first the fault whereby god is offended then the guilt which bindeth ouer the conscience vnto punishment thirdly the punishment it selfe which is eternall death of these three not the guilt or punishment but the fault or offence makes a man a sinner but here is a further difficultie whe a man hath committed some offence and the saide offence is done and past it may be some twentie or thirtie yeares yet the partie offending doth not therefore cease to be a sinner now then i demaund what is the very thing for which he is named and rearmed still a sinner in the time present the offence beeing past the answer is that euery actuall sinne beside the three former must be considered with a fourth thing to wit a certaine staine or blotte which it imprints and leaues in the offender as a fruite and that is an inclination or euill disposition of the heart whereby it becomes apter or pronener to the offence done or to any other sinne for looke as the dropsie man the more he drink the drier he is and the more he still desires to drinke euen so a sinner the more he sinnes the apter is he to sinne and more desirous to keepe still a course in wickednesse and as a man that lookes vpon the sun if he turne his face away remaines turned vntill he turne himselfe againe so he that turnes from god by any sinne makes himselfe a sinner and so remaines vntill he turne himselfe againe by repentance thus dauid was a sinner not onely in the very acte of his adulterie and murther but euen when the acte was done and past he remained still a murtherer and an adulterer because a newe or rather a renewed pronenesse to these and all other sinnes tooke place in his heart by his fall and got strength till he turned to god by repentance vpon the admonition of the prophet the thing then whereby a sinner is tearmed a sinner is the fault together with the fruit thereof namely the blotte imprinted in the soule so oft as man doe actually offend the vse of this doctrine touching sinne is two fold first by it we learne and see what is originall sinne whereby an infant in the first conception and birth is indeed a sinner euery infant must be considered as a part of adam proceeding of him and partaking of his nature and thereby it is made a sinner not onely by imputation of adams offence but also by propagation of an aptnesse amp pronenesse vnto euery evil receiued together with nature from adam and thus ought we to conceiue originall sinne not to be the corruption of nature alone but adams first offence imputed with the fruit thereof the corruption of nature which is an inclination vnto euery euill deriued together with nature from our first parents secondly by this we are taught to take heed of all and euery sinne whether it be in thought word or deed because the committing therof though in respect of the act it passeth away in the doing yet it breedeth and increaseth a wicked disposition in the heart as hath beene said to the offence done or any other sinne man deceiue theselues that thinke all the euill of sinne to be only in the act of sinning amp to go no further wheras indeed euery offence hath a certen blot going with it that corrupteth the heart and causeth man to delight and lie in his offence which lying in sinne is a greater cause of damnation then the very sinne it selfe this therefore must admonish vs to take heed least we continue in any sinne and if it fall out that through infirmitie we be ouertaken by any tentation wee must labour to rise againe and turne from our sinne to god by new and speedy repentance thus much of sinne it selfe now follow the differences thereof which are manifold the first sort are to be gathered from the causes and beginnings of sinne in man which are threefold reason will and affection the differences of sinne in respect of reason are these first some are sinnes of knowledge some of ignorance a sinne of knowledge is when a man offends against his knowledge doing euill when he knoweth it to be euill and this is greater then a sinne of ignorance for he that knoweth his masters will and doth it not shall be beaten with many stripes a sinne of ignorance is when a man doth euill not knowing it to be euill thus paul was a blasphemer an oppressour and persecuted the church of christ ignorantly and in a blind zeale not knowing that which he did to be euill nowe by ignorance here i meane an ignorance of those things which ought to be knowne and this is twofold simple or affected simple ignorance is when a man after diligence and good paines taking still remaines ignorant this ignorance will not excuse any man if it be of such things as he is bound to know for it is faide he that doth not his masters will by reason he knew it not shall be beaten with stripes though fewer and in this regard euen the heathen which knew not god are inexcusable because they were bound to haue knowne him for adam had the perfect knowledge of god imprinted in his nature and lost the same through his own default for himselfe and his posteritie and it is the commandement of god whereunto euery man is bound to performe obedience that man should know him that is his will and word but some may demand how any man can be saued seeing euery man is ignorant of many things which he ought to know ans if we know the grounds of religion and be carefull to obey god according to our knowledge hauing withal a care and desire to increase in the knowledge of god and his will god will hold vs excused for our desire and indeauour to obey is accepted for obedience it selfe and the greater this simple ignorance is the less is the sinne and hereupon peter lesseneth amp in some sort excuseth the sinne of the iewes in crucifying christ because they did it through ignorace and so doth paul his sin in persecuting the church when he alleadgeth that it was done ignorantly in vnbeleefe but howsoeuer this sinne by such meanes may be lessened yet remaines it still a sinne worthie condemnation affected ignorance is whe a man takes delight in his ignorace and will of purpose be ignorant not vsing but contemning the meanes whereby to get and increase knowledge and that carelessely and negligently because he wil not leaue sinne which he loueth nor forsake the euill trade of life wherein he delighteth this is the sinne of those whereof iob speaketh who say vnto god depart from vs for we desire not the knowledge of thy waies and of whome dauid complaineth that they flat them selues in their owne eyes and haue left off to vnderstand and to doe good this ignorance is damnable and deuillish it excuseth no man but doth rather aggrauate and increase his sinne yes it is the mother of many grieuous enormities againe ignorance is twofold of the ignoran i iuris law or of the thing the law requireth ignorance of the law is when a man knowes not the law of god written nor the law of nature this ignorance may somewhat lessen the sinne but it excuseth no man because it is naturall and euery man is bound to know the law ignorance of the thing the law requireth is the ignorance of the ignorancia fact fact and that is either with the fault of the doer or without the fault faultie ignorance is the ignorance of a fact which he might haue preuented as whe a man in his drunkennes killeth another in this fact not knowing what he doth he also knoweth not that he hath offended and yet because he might haue preuented his drunkennes therefore he is faultie and sinneth faultlesse ignorance is when a fact is done which could not be either knowne or auoided before hand for example if a man be lopping a tree and his axe head fall from the helue out of his hand and kills another passing by here is indeede manslaughter but no voluntarie murther because it was a thing that could not be auoided and did not fall out through his default and this ignorance is excusable the second fountaine of sinne is the will from whence arise these three differences of sinnes some are from the will immediatly some besides the will and some are mixt partly with the will and partly against the will sinnes proceeding from the will are properly tearmed voluntarie such as the doer mooued by his owne will commits though he know them to be euill and here the more free the will is the greater is the sinne for wil added to knowledge makes the sinne the greater vnder voluntarie sinnes are comprehended all such as proceede from stirred affections as when a man tells a lie for feare or striketh another in anger and the reason is because these offences though they are not done vpon deliberation but arise from the violence of affection yet they doe not exclude consent hither also we may referre sinnes comitted by compulsion as when a man is forced to denie his religion his offence in deede and in truth is voluntarie though some otherwise thinke it to be a mixt action for compulsion doth not reach to the will but to the outward man and serues to draw forth a consent and when consent is yeelded he denies his religion voluntarily for the will cannot be constrained in the next place sinnes beside the will are such as are neither directly from the will nor against it of this sort are the first sudden motions vnto sinne conceiued in the heart with some inward pleasure and delight and these are truly sinnes though in respect little sinnes condemned in the last commandement and they are not from the will because they go without and before consent neither yet are they against the will because then the heart would not take delight in them here by the way we are to note against the doctrine of the papists that all sinnes are not voluntarie for whatsoeuer wanteth conformitie to the law of god it is sinne whether it be with consent of will or no but many such desires and delights arise suddenly in the heart of man which are not according to the law of god and haue no consent or approbation of will in like manner when one man kills another thinking that he killeth a wild beast if the same man remembreth after wards what he hath done and is not grieued for the fact in this case he hath sinned because his not grieuing is offensiue vnto god though the fact were meerely besides his will mixt sinnes are partly from the will partly against it of this sort are the workes of the man regenerate which are done partly with his will and partly against his will beeing partly good and partly euill the reason hereof is this there are in man after regeneration two contrarie grounds or beginnings of actions to wit naturall corruption or the inclination of the minde will and affections to that which is against the law called the flesh and a created qualitie of holines wrought in the said faculties by the holy ghost tearmed the spirit and these two are not seuered but ioyned and mingled together in all the faculties and powers of the soule now betweene these there is a continuall combate corruption fighting against grace amp grace against corruption hence it is that there beeing eue in one amp the same will cotrarie inclinations there must necessarily flow from the man regenerate contrary actions the flesh in euery action willing that which is euill and the spirit on the otherside that which is good this paul confessed and acknowledged vpon his owne experience after his conuersion when he said to will is present with me but i find no meanes perfectly to doe that which is good again i delight in the law of god concerning the inner man but i see another law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde and leading me captiue to the law of sinne which is in my members the third ground or fountaine of sinne in man is affection fro whence doe proceede two kinds namely sinnes of infirmitie and sinnes of presumption sinnes of infirmitie are such as proceede from the sudden passions of the mind and the strong affections of the heart as from hatred griefe anger sorrow and such like these sinnes are comonly thought to be in all man but the truth is they are properly incident to the regenerate for infirmitie cannot be said properly to be in them in whome sinne hath firmitie or strength and where is no power of grace at all againe the man that is regenerate sinneth not either when he would because he is restrained by the grace of god that is in him or in what manner he would partly because he sinneth not with all his heart the strength of his flesh beeing abated by the spirit and partly for that beeing fallen he lies not stil but recouers himselfe by speedy repentace an euident argument that the sins whereinto he falleth are not presumptuous but arise ordinarily of weaknes and infirmitie sinnes of presumption are such as proceede fro pride arrogancy wilfulnes and hau nes of mans heart against these dauid praieth saying let not presumptuous sinnes haue dominion ouer me and of them there be three degrees the first is when a man wilfully goeth on in his sinnes vpon an erronious perswasion of god mercie and of his owne future repentance this is the sinne of most man the second is when a man sinneth wilfully in contempt of the law of god this is called by moses a sinne with a high hand amp the punishment thereof was by present death to be cut off from among the people the third when a man sinneth not onely wilfully and contemptuously but of set malice amp spight against god himselfe and christ iesus and by this we may conceiue what is the sinne against the holy ghost which is not euery sinne of presumption or against knowledge and conscience but such a kind of presumptuous offence in which true religion is renounced and that of set purpose and resolued malice against the very maiestie of god himselfe and christ heb now follow other differences of sinne in regard of the obiect thereof which is the law in respect of the law sinne is twofold either of commission or of omission i say in respect of the law because god hath reuealed in his law two sorts of precepts the one wherein some good thing is commanded to be done as to loue god with all our hearts and our neighbour as our selues the other wherein some euill is forbidden to be done as the making of a grauen image the taking of the name of god in vaine ampc now a sinne of commission is when a man doth any thing that is flatly forbidden in the law and word of god as when one man kills another contrarie to the law which saith thou shalt not kill a sinne of omission is when a man leaueth vnperformed some dutie which the law requireth as for example the preseruing of his neighbours life or good estate when it lieth in his power so to doe these also are truly sinnes and by them as well as by the other man shall be tried in the last iudgement sinnes of omission haue three degrees first when a man doth nothing at all but omits the dutie commanded both in whole and in part as when hauing opportunitie and abilitie he doth not mooue so much as one finger for the sauing of his neighbours life secondly when a man performes the dutie inioyned but failes both in the manner and measure thereof thus the heathen man failed in doing good workes in that the things which they did for substance and matter were good and commendable beeing done vpon ciuill and honest respects and referred to common good yet in truth their actions were no better then sinnes of omission in as much as they issued from corrupted fountaines hearts void of faith and aimed not at the maine end and scope of all humane actions the honour and glorie of god thirdly when a man doth things in a right manner but faileth in the measure thereof and thus the children of god doe sinne in all the duties of the law for they doe the good things the law commandeth as loue god and their neighbour but they cannot attaine to that measure of loue which the law requireth and thus the best man liuing doe sinne in euery good worke they doe so as if god should enter into iudgement deale with them in the rigour of his iustice and examine them by the strict rule of the law he might iustly condemne them euen for their best actions and in this regard when we pray daily for the pardon of our sinnes the best workes we doe must come in the number of them because we faile if not in substance and manner yet at the least in the measure of goodnes that ought to be in the doing of them we must also haue care to repent vs euen of these our sinnes of omission as well as of the other of commission because by leauing vndone our dutie we doe ofter offend then by sinnes committed and the least omission is enough to condemne vs i it should be exacted at our hands the next differece of sinnes may be this some are crying sinnes some are sinnes of toleration crying sinnes i call those which are so hainous and in their kind so grieuous that they hasten god iudgements and call downe for speedie vegeance vpon the sinner of this kind there are sundrie exaples in the scriptures principally foure first cains sinne in murthering his innocent brother abel whereof it was saide the voice of thy brothers blood crieth vnto me from the earth the next is the sinne of sodome and gomorrha which was pride fulnes of bread abundance of idlenesse vnmercifull dealing with the poore and all manner of vncleannesse ezech and of this the lord said that the crie of sodome and gomorrha was great and their sinnes exceeding grieuous the third is the sinne of oppressio indured by the israelites in egypt at the hand of pharao and his task masters the fourth is mercilesse iniustice in wrongful withholding and detaining the labourers hire now they are called crying sinnes for these causes first because they are now come to their full measure amp height beyond which god will not suffer them to passe without due punishment againe the lord takes more notice and inquires further into them the into others by reason that they exceede and are most eminent where they be committed thirdly they call for present helpe to the afflicted and wronged and consequently for speedie exequution of vengeance vpon the authors and committers of them and lastly because god is wont to giue eare vn to the cries of those that endure so heauie measure at the hands of others and accordingly to helpe them and reward the other with deserued punishment next vnto these are sinnes of toleration less then the former which though in themselues they deserue death yet god in his mercie shewes his patience and long sufferance vpon the committers thereof either deferring the temporall punishment or pardoning both temporall and eternall to his elect such a sinne was the ignorance of the gentiles before christs comming which god deferred to punnish and as we may say winked at it more especially there be three sorts of sinnes of toleration the first is originall sinne or concupiscence in the regenerate after regeneration for it is not in our conuersion quite abolished but remaines more or lesse molesting and tempting vs till death and yet if we carrie a constant purpose not to sinne and indeauour our selues to resist all tentations this concupiscence of ours shall not be imputed vnto vs nor we condemned for it and to this purpose the holy apostle saith there is no condemnation to them that are in christ yet saith he not there is nothing worthie condemnation in them for originall sinne remaines till death truly deseruing damnation though it be not imputed the second kind of sinnes of toleration are vnknowne and hidden sinnes in the regenerate for who can tell how of the offendeth saith dauid when a man that is the child of god shall examine his heart and humble himselfe euen for all his particular sinnes which he knoweth by himselfe there shall yet remaine some vnknowne sinnes of which he cannot haue a particular repentance and yet they are not imputed but pardoned whe there is repentance for knowne sinnes as for example dauid repents of his murther and adulterie and yet afterwards erring in iudgement by reason of the corruption of the times he liued to his death in the sinne of polygamie without any particular repentace that we heare of in like manner did the patriarks who may not altogether be excused yet they were not condemned therefore neither were they saued without repentance for this sinne but god in mercie accepted a generall repentance for the same and the like is the case of all the elect in regard of their secret and hidden faults for vnlesse god should accept of a generall repentance for vnknowne sinnes few or none at all should be saued and herein doth the endlesse mercie of god notably appeare that he vouchsafeth to accept of our repentace whe we repent though not in particular as we ought to doe neuertheles this must not incorage or imbolde any ma to liue in his sinnes without turning vnto god for vnles we repent in particular of all the sinnes we know not only our knowne offences but euen our secret sinnes shall condemne vs many sinnes are comitted by man which afterwards in processe of time be quite forgotten others are comitted which notwithstanding are not known whether they be sins or no and in doing the best duties we can we offend often amp yet when we offend we perceiue it not and all these in the regenerate through the mercie of god are sinnes of toleration in respect of particular repetance the third kind of sinnes of toleration are certain particular facts of man reprooued in scripture and yet neuer punished such was the fact of zipporah in circucising her child in the presence of her husband he beeing able to haue done it himselfe and shee hauing no calling to doe that which shee did for though the had of god was against him yet was he not sick as some would excuse the matter neither is there any such thing in the text but it is rather to be thought that she her selfe circucised her son in hast to preuent her husband for the deede was done in some indignation and shee cast the foreskin at his feete and yet because this fact was some manner of obedience in that the thing was done which god required though not in that manner that he required god accepted the same amp staied his had from killing moses thus god accepted of achabs humilitie though it were in hypocrisie because it was a shew of obedience and for that deferred a temporall punishment till the daies of his posteritie god sent lyons to destroy the assyrians that dwelt in samatia for their idolatry yet soone as they had learned to feare the lord after the manner of the god of israel though they mingled the same with their own idolatry god for that halfe obedience suffered them to dwell in peace the sixt distinction of sinnes may be this some are sinnes against god some against man this distinction is grounded vpon a place in samuel if one man sinne against another the iudge shall iudge it but if a man sinne against the lord who shall plead for him sinnes against god are such as are directly and immediately committed against the maiestie of god such are atheisme idolatry blasphemie petiurie profanation of the sabbaoth and all the breaches of the first table sinnes against man are iniuries hurts losses and damages whereby our neighbour is in his dignitie life chastitie wealth good name or any other way iustly offended or by vs hindred and such actions must be considered two waies first as they are iniuries amp hurts done vnto our neighbour and secondly as they are breaches of god law forbidding vs so to doe and in this second respect they are called sinnes because sinne is properly against god and therefore by sinnes against man we are to vnderstand iniuries losses or damages done vnto them in this sense must that place in matthew be expounded if thy brother sinne against thee ampc the seauenth difference of sinnes is noted by s paul where he saith euery sinne that a man doth is without the bodie but he that commits fornication sinneth against his owne bodie in which place sinnes are distinguished into those that are without the bodie and those that are against a mans owne bodie sinnes without the bodie are such sinnes as a man committeth his bodie being the instrument of the sinne but not the thing abused such are murther theft amp drunkennesse for in the committing of these sinnes the bodie is but a helper and onely a remote instrumentall cause and the thing abused is without the bodie for example in drunkennes the thing abused by the drunkard is wine or strong drinke in theft another mans goods in murther the instrument whereby the fact is committed the bodie indeede conferres his helpe to these things but the iniurie is directed to the creatures of god to the bodie and goods of our neighbour and such are all sinnes adulterie onely excepted sinnes against the bodie are those in which it selfe is not onely the instrument but the thing abused too such a sinne is adulterie only and those that are of that kind properly against the bodie first because the bodie of the sinner is both a furthering cause of the sinne and also that thing which he abuseth against his owne selfe secondly by this offence he doth not onely hinder but loose the right power and proprietie of his bodie in that he makes it the member of an harlot and lastly though other sinnes in their kind doe bring a shame and dishonour vpon the bodie yet there is none that sitteth so nigh or leaueth a blot so deepely imprinted in it as doth the sinne of vncleannes the eight distinction of sinnes is grounded vpon pauls exhortation to timothie communicate not with other mens sinnes sinnes are either other mens sinnes or comunication with other mens sinnes this distinction is the rather to be knowne and remembred because it serues to extenuate or aggrauate sinnes committed communication with sinne is done sundrie waies first by counsell thus caiphas sinned when he gaue counsell to put christ to death secondly by commandement so dauid sinned in the mu tner of vrias thirdly by consent or assistace rom thus saul sinned in keeeping the garments of them that stoned steuen act fourthly by prouocation thus they sinne that prouoke others to sinne and hereof paul speaketh when he saith fathers must not prouoke their children to wrath ephesians fiftly by negligence when man are called to reprooue sinne and doe not sixtly by flatterie when man sooth vp others in sinne seauenthly by winking at sinnes or passing them ouer by slight reproofe ephesians thus eli sinned in rebuking his sonnes and thereby brought a temporall iudgement vpon himselfe and his familie sam chap and eightly by participation ephesians amp thus they do sin that are receiuers of theeues ninthly by defending another man in his sinne for he that iustifieth the wicked and condemneth the iust euen they both are an abomination to the lord the ninth distinction followeth some mens sinnes saith paul are open before hand some follow after which place by some is expounded thus some mens sinnes are kept secret till the last iudgement and some are reuealed in this life before that day this i thinke is a truth but not the meaning of the text for in the verse the apostle spake of ordination giuing charge to timothie that he should not suddenly admit any into ecclesiasticall offices least he did partake with their sinnes now in this verse he rendereth a reason thereof saying some mens sinnes are open before hand that is some mens faults and wants are knowne before their ordination to ecclesiasticall offices and of such the church may know what to iudge and say but some againe follow after that is they are not reuealed till after their ordination and thus iudas his wickednes did not appeare at the first but was reuealed after he was called to be an apostle and thus we see what be the differences of sinnes touching all which this must be held and remembred for a ground that euery sinne in what degree so euer it be is mortall of it selfe and no sinne is veniall in it owne nature for the ages of euery sinne is death rom and cursed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the law to doe them gal this ground must be holden against the church of rome who in her case diuinitie vseth to pacifie the conscience by teaching man that sundrie of their sins be veniall and though euery sinne of it selfe be mortall yet all are not equally mortall but some more some lesse because in sinne there be sundrie degrees as hath beene in part shewed againe the same sinne may be encreased or lessened and consequently made more or lesse hainous sundrie waies first by the circumstances which are principally seauen the first is the subject or person sinning thus the sin of a publike person is more beinous yes more mortall then the sinne of a priuate man because he is in eminent place and his actions are more exemplarie and scandalous then are the actions of inferiour man the servant that knowes his masters will if he doth it not is the greater sinner and shall endure a greater punishment then he that neglectes the same vpon simple ignorance matth the minister and dispenser of the word if he be vnfaithfull and vnprofitable his offence and consequently his punishment is farre greater then other mens matth the second is the obiect or partie which is offended thus the iewes did more heinously sinne in crucifying christ the son of god the lord of glorie then did their fathers which persequuted and killed the prophets the iniurie that is done vnto those whome god tenderly loueth is farre more displeasing vnto him the if it were done to others he that toucheth you saies the prophet meaning the iewes his chosen amp beloued people toucheth the apple of his eie zach the man that deniseth mischiefe against his harmelesse brother that dwelleth peaceably by him committeth a sinne most odious vnto god and man prov psalm he that is called and conuerted vnto god and christ and maketh not honest prouision for his owne which are of his familie is so notorious an offendour that s paul holds him a denier of the faith and worse then an infidell tim the person that shall raile vpon the iudge or speake euill of the ruler of his people is a greater transgressour of god commandement then he that reuileth or abuseth an ordinarie man exod the third is the thing done in which the offence is committed thus to falsifie the word of god and to prophane his worshippe and seruice is much more abominable in his sight then is the falsifying of the word of a man or the abuse of humane lawes and ordinances the hurting and indamaging of the person and life of our neighbour is a more odious offence then is the diminishing of his goods and outward estate and the hurt that redoundeth by our default vnto his soule is more offensiue euery way then the wrong that is offered vnto his bodie the fourth is the place where it is done according to this circumstance if a man shall either speake or doe any thing that comes vnder the name of a breach of pietie or iustice in publike place as in the congregation in open court or generall assembly and that with publike and generall scandall he is a greater offendour then if he spake or did the same at home in his house or closet the fist is the end in respect whereof he that stealeth from another that whereby he may satisfie his hunger and saue his life beeing driuen to extreame necessitie offendeth in a lower and less degree then the theefe that robbeth by the high way side for this ende to enrich himselfe by the losses of other man the sixt is the manner how thus he that committeth vncleannesse in the outward act doeth more grieuously sinne and with greater scandall then if he onely entertained an vncleane thought into his heart and he that sinneth of set purpose and presumption or of obstinate and resolued malice against god hath proceeded vnto a higher degree of iniquitie then if he had fallen vpon ignorance infirmitie or disordered and distempered affection in like manner the sinne of the iewes in forcing pilate by their threatning tearmes as that he was an enemie to caesar ampc to the vniust condemnatio of christ iesus was in a higher degree then the sinne of pilate himselfe who yeilding vnto their importunitie pronounced sentence against him ioh the last is the time which also serues to aggrauate the sinne for ordinarie disobedience in the time of grace and wilfull neglect of god calling in the aboundance of meanes is a great deale more damnable then the comission of sin in the daies of ignorace and blindnesse whe the like means are wanting now from this doctrine of the increasing and lessening of sin in these respects we may gather that all sins are not alike or equall as the stoicks of ancient times and their followers haue falsely imagined for it hath bin prooued at large by induction of sundrie particulars that there are degrees of sinnes some less some greater some more offensiue and odious to god amp man some lesse and that the circustances of time place person and manner of doing doe serue to enlarge or extenuate the sinne committed if it be here alleadged that sin is nothing but the doing of that which is unlawful to be done and that this is equall in all man that sinne and therfore by consequent offences are equall i answer that in euery sinne man must not consider the vnlawfulnesse thereof onely but the reason why it should be unlawful and that is properly because it a breach of god law and repugnant to his will reuealed in his word nowe there is no breach of a diuine law but it is more or lesse repugnant vnto the will of the lawgiuer god himselfe and many transgressions are more repugnant thereunto then fewer for the more sin is increased the more is the wrath of god inflamed against the sinner vpon his due desert if it be said again that the nature of sinne stands onely in this that the sinner makes an aberration from the scope or marke that is set before him and doth no more then passe the bondes of duty prescribed by god and that all are alike in this respect the answer is that it is a falshood to affirme that he which makes the lesse aberration from the dutie commanded is equall in offence to him that makes the greater for the same sinne for substance hath sundrie steppes and degrees in respect whereof one man becommeth a more heinous offender then another for example in the seauenth commandement when god forbiddes the committing of adulterie he forbiddeth three degrees of the same sinne to wit adulterie of the heart consisting of inordinate and vncleane affections adulterie of the tongue in corrupt dishonest and vnseemely speeches and the very act of vncleannesse and filthinesse committed by the bodie nowe it cannot be said that he which breakes this commandement onely in the first degree is as great a transgressour as he that hath proceeded to the second and so to the third and therefore it remaines for an vndoubred trueth that sinnes committed against the law of god are not equall but some less some greater the second way to aggrauate sinne is by addition of sinne to sinne and that is done sundry waies first by committing one sinne in the necke of another as dauid sinned when he added murther to adulterie secondly by doubling and multiplying of sinne that is by falling often into the same sinne thirdly by lying in sinne without repentance and here it must be remembred that man of yeares liuing in the church are not simply condemned for their particular sinnes but for their continuance and residence in them sinnes committed make man worthie of damnation but liuing and abiding in them without repentance is the thing that brings damnation for as in the militant church man are excommunicate not so much for their offence as for their obstinacie so shall it be in the church triumphant the kingdome of heauen shall be barred against man not so much for their sinne committed as for their lying therein without repentance and this is the manner of god dealing with those that haue liued within the precincts of the church they shall be condemned for the very want of true faith and repentance this should admonish euery one of vs to take heed least we lie in any sin and that beeing any way ouertaken we should speedily repent least we aggrauate our sinne by continuance therein and so bring vpon our selues swift damnation thirdly the same sinne is made greater or less waies according to the number of degrees in the committing of a sinne noted by s iames temptation conception birth and perfection actuall sinne in the first degree of tentation is when the minde vpon some sudden motion is drawne away to thinke euill and withall is tick led with some delight therein for a bad motio cast into the minde by the flesh and the deuill is like vnto the baite cast into the water that allureth and delighteth the fish and causeth it to bite sinne in conception is when with the delight of the minde there goes consent of will to doe the euill thought on sinne in birth is when it comes forth into action or execution sinne in perfection when man are growne to a custome and habit in sinne vpon long practise for the often committing of one and the same sinne leaues an euill impression in the heart that is a strong or violent inclination to that or any other euill as hath bin taught before and sinne thus made perfect brings forth death for custome in sinning brings hardnes of heart hardnes of heart impenitencie and impenitencie codemnation now of these degrees the first is the least and the last is the greatest one and the same sinne is less in tentation then in conception and les e in conception then in birth and greater in perfection then in all the former sundry other distinctions there are of sinnes as namely that the maine sinnes of the first table are greater then the maine sinnes of the second table and yet the maine sinnes of the second are greater then the breach of ceremoniall duties against the first table but this which hath beene said shall suffice the vse of this doctrine is manifold first by it we learne what the heart of man is by nature namely a corrupt and vncleane fountaine out of which issueth in the course of this life the streams of corruptions infinite in number noysome in qualities hainous in degrees dagerous in effects for from thence doe flow all the differences of sins before named with their seuerall branches and infinit many more that cannot be rehearsed this must mooue vs humbly to sue vnto god amp earnestly to intreat him to wash vs throughly from our wickednes amp clense vs fro our sins yes to purge and to rinse the fountaine thereof our vncleane and polluted hearts and when by god mercy in christ appreheded by faith our hearts shal be purified then to set watch amp ward ouer them and to keep them with all diligence secondly it teacheth vs that miserable mortall man is not guiltie of one or more sins but of many amp sundrie corruptions both of heart and life who can vnderstad his faults saith dauid now the alowace of sin being death by god ordinace amp god being iustice it selfe answerably to the number of our offences must we needs be lyable to many punishments yes to death it selfe both of the bodie and of the soule this beeing our wofull estate litle cause is there that any man should thinke himselfe to be in good case or presume of god mercie in regard of the small number of his sinnes and much lesse cause hath he falsely to imagine with the popish sort that he can merit the fauour of god by any worke done by him aboue that which the law requireth considering that it is impossible for him to knowe either the number or the nature or the measure of his sinnes lastly the consideration of this point must be a barre to keepe vs in that we be not too secure or presumptuous of our owne estate for as much as we learne out of the word of god that in respect of the multitude of our corruptions this our life is full of much euill and many difficulty that we haue whole armies of enemy to encounter withall not only out of vs in the world abroad but within vs lurking euen in our owne flesh and vpon this consideration that we should be at continuall defiance with them vsing all holy meanes to get the victorie ouer them by the daily exercises of inuocation and repentance and by a continuall practise of new obedience vnto all the lawes and commandements of god according to the measure of grace receiued and so much of the third ground the fourth and last ground is touching the subiection amp power of conscience conscience is a knowledge ioyned with a knowledge for by conscience we knowe what we know and by it we knowe that thing of our selues which god knoweth of vs the naturall condition of euery mans conscience is this that it is placed in the middle betweene man and god vnder god and aboue man and this naturall condition hath two parts the one is the subiection of conscience to god and his word the second is a power whereby the conscience is ouer the man to vrge and binde him of the first we haue this rule that god alone by his word doeth onely binde conscience properly for he is the onely lord of the conscience which created it and gouerns it he againe is the onely lawe giuer that hath power to saue or destroy the soule for the keeping and breaking of his lawes iam againe mans conscience is knowne to none but to god and it is he onely that giues libertie to the conscience in regard of his owne lawes vpon this it followeth that no mans commandement or lawe can of it selfe and by it owne soueraigne power binde conscience but doeth it onely by the authoritie and vertue of the written word of god or some part thereof nowe the power of conscience appeares in pauls rule whatsoeuer is not of faith that is whatsoeuer man doeth whereof he is not certainly perswaded in iudgement and conscience out of god word it is sinne more plainely a thing may be said not to be done of faith two waies first when it is done with a doubting and vnresolued conscience as in those that are weake in knowledg of which sort were some in the primitiue church who notwithstanding they heard of the doct ine of christian libertie yet they were of opinion that after christs ascension there was a difference to be made of meats and therevpon thought they might not eat of some kind of meats suppose now that these persons by accident should haue bin drawne to eate swines flesh which themselues had holden a thing forbidden these man vpon this very fact haue sinned because that which they did was vpon an vnresolued conscience secondly when a thing is done vpon an erronious conscience it is done not of faith and therefore a sinne the reason is because the conscience though it erre and be deceiued yet it bindeth so sarre forth as that if a man iudge a thing to be euill either simply or in some respect though falsely and yet afterward doeth it he hath sinned and offended the maiestie of god as much as in him lie h thus much touching the preambles or groundes of this doctrine nowe it remaineth that we come to the questions of conscience these questions may be fitly deuided according to the matter or subiect of them which is man now as man is considered diverse waies that is to say either apart by himselfe or as he standes in relation to another and is a member of a societie so the questions of conscience are to be distinguished some concerning man simply considered by himselfe some againe as he stands in relation to another ma stadeth in a twofold relatio to god or to ma as he stads in relatio to man he is a part of a bodie and a member of some societie nowe the questions that concerne him as a member of a societie are of three sorts according to the three distinct kinds of societies for euery ma is either a member of a family or of the church or of the comonwealth and answerably some questios concerne man as a member of a family some as he is a meber of the church some as he is a member of the commonwealth in a word therfore all questios touching ma may be reduced to generall heads the first wherof is concerning man simply considered as he is a man the secod touching man as he stads in relatio to god the third concerning him as he is a member of one of the three societies that is either of the family or of the church or of the commonwealth qvestions of the first sort as man is a christian are especially three what must a man doe that he may come into god fauour and be saued for answer to this question some ground must be laid down before hand for it is to be considered and remembred in the first place how and by what meanes god that saueth brings a man to saluation in the working and effecting of our saluation there are two speciall works of god the giuing of the first grace and after that the giuing of the second the former of these two workes hath x seuerall actions i god giues man the outward meanes of saluation specially the ministerie of the word and with it he sends some outward crosse to breake and subdue the stubbernnesse of our nature that it may be made plyeable to the will of god ii this done god brings the minde of man to a consideration of the lawe and therein generally to see what is good and what is euill what is sinne and what is not sinne iii vpon a serious consideration of the law he makes a man particularly to see and know his own peculiar and proper sinnes iv vpon the sight of sinne he smites the heart with the spirit of feare whereby when man seeth his sinnes he makes him to feare punishment and hell and to dispaire of saluation in regard of any thing in himselfe now these foure actions are indeed no fruits of grace but are onely workes of preparation going before grace the other actions which follow are effects of grace v the fift action of grace therefore is to stirre vp the minde to a serious consideration of the promise of saluation propounded and published in the gospel vi after this the sixt is to kindle in the heart some seed ot sparkes of faith that is a will and desire to beleeue and grace to striue against doubting and dispaire nowe at the same instant when god beginnes to kindle in the heart any sparkes of faith then also he iustifies the sinner and withall beginnes the worke of sanctification vii then so soone as faith is put into the heart there is presently a combate for it fighteth with doubting dispaire and distrust and in this combate faith shews it selfe by seruent constant and earnest inuocation for pardon and after inuocation followes a strength amp preuailing of this desire viii furthermore god in mercie quiets and setles the conscience as touching the saluation of the soule and the promise of life whereupon it resteth and staieth it selfe ix next after this setled assurance amp perswasion of mercie followes a stirring vp of the heart to euangelicall sorrow according to god that is a griefe for sinne because it is sinne and because god is offended and then the lord workes repentance whereby the sanctified heart turnes it selfe vnto him and though this repentance be one of the last in order yet it shewes it selfe first as when a candle is brought into a roome we first see the light before wee see the candle and yet the candle must needes be before light can be x lastly god giues a man grace to endeauour to obey his commandements by a newe obedience and by these degrees doeth the lord giue the first grace the second worke of god tending to saluation is to giue the second grace which is nothing else but the continuance of the first worke begun that a man may perseuere in grace to the ende now then to come the answer the holy ghost hath propounded to vs this question of conscience together with the resolution thereof in these examples following the man that were at peters sermon beeing touched with the sense of their owne miserie vpon the doctrine which had beene deliuered as the holy ghost saies were pricked in their hearts and cried one to another man and brother what shall we doe peter mooued by the spirit of god answers them repent and bee baptized for the remission of your sinnes the like was the case of the iayler who after that the stubbernnesse of his heart was beaten downe by feare of the departure of the prisoners he came trembling and fell downe before paul and silas and mooued this question vnto them sirs vvhat must i doe to bee saued to whome they gaue answere beleeue in the lord iesus and thou shalt be saued and thine houshold the young man in the gospell sues to christ and askes him what shall i doe to be saued christ answers him keepe the commandements when he replied that he had kept them from his youth christ tells him that he must goe yet further and sell all that he hath and giue to the poore and john tells the scribes and pharises who came vnto his baptisme and confessed their sinnes that if they would flie from the wrath to come they must repent and bring forth fruits worthie a mendement of life i answer then out of all these places that he that would stand in the fauour of god and be saued must doe foure things first humble himselfe before god secondly beleeue in christ thirdly repent of his sinnes fourthly performe newe obedience vnto god for the first humiliation is indeede a fruite of faith yet i put it in place before faith because in practise it is first faith lieth hid in the heart and the first effect wherein it appeares is the abasing and humbling of our selues and here we are further to consider three points first wherein stands humiliation secondly the excellencie of it thirdly the questions of conscience that concerne it touching the first point humiliation stands in the practise of three things the first is a sorrow of heart whereby the sinner is displeased with himselfe and ashamed in respect of his sins the second is a confession to god wherein also three things are to be done first to acknowledge all our maine sinnes originall and actuall secondly to acknowledge our guiltinesse before god thirdly to acknowledge our iust damnation for sinne the third thing in humiliation is supplication made to god for mercie as earnestly as in a matter of life and death and of these three things we haue in scripture the examples of ezra daniel and the prodigall son ezra daniel luke the second point is the excellencie of humiliation which stands in this that it hath the promises of life eternall annexed to it isaiah i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to reuiue the spirit of the humble and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart psalm a contrite and a broken heart o god thou wilt not despise prou he that hideth his sinnes shall not prosper but he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall finde mercie ioh if we acknowledge our sinnes he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnesse by all these and many other places it is manifest that in the very instant whe a sinner begins truly in heart and conscience to humble himselfe he is then entred into the state of saluation so soone as dauid said i haue sinned nathan pronounceth in the name of the lord that his sinnes were put away and dauid himselfe saith alluding to the former place i said i will confesse my sinne and loe thou forga est the wickednesse of my sinne when the prodigall son had but said i will goe to my father ampc euen then before he humbled himselfe his father meetes him and receiues him the third point is touching the questions of conscience concerning humiliatio all which may be reduced to foure principall cases i case what if it fall out that a man in humbling himselfe cannot call to minde either all or the most of his sinnes i answer a particular humiliation indeed is required for maine and known sins but yet there are two cases wherein generall repentance will be accepted of god for vnknown sinnes one is when a man hath searched himselfe diligently and by a serious examination passed through all the commandements of god and yet after such examination and search made cannot call to remembrance his particular offences then the generall repentance is accepted for this is answerable to the practise of dauid who after long search when he could not attaine to the knowledge of his par icular slippes then he addresseth himselfe to a generall humiliation saying who knoweth the errours of this life clense me lord from my secret faults and vpon this he was no doubt accepted againe when a man humbleth himselfe and yet is preuented by the time so as he cannot search his heart and life as he would his generall repentance will be taken and accepted of god the truth hereof appeares in the theife vpon the crosse who hauing no time to search himselfe made no speciall humiliation yet vpon his generall confession he was accepted now the ground of this doctrine is this he that truely repents himselfe of one sinne in this case when he is preuented is as if he repented of all ii case what must a man doe that finds himselfe hard hearted and of a dead spirit so as he cannot humble himselfe as he would answer such persons if they humble themselues they must be content with that grace which they haue receiued for if thou be grieued truely and vnfainedly for this that thou canst not be grieued thy humiliation shall be accepted for that which paul saith of almes may be truely said in this case that if there be a readie minde a man shall be accepted according to that he hath and not according to that he hath not iii case whether the party that is more grieued for losse of his friend then for offence of god by his sinne doeth or can truely humble himselfe answer a man may haue a greater griefe for an earthly losse then for the other and yet be truely grieued for his sinnes too the reason is because that is a bodily naturall and sensible losse and accordingly sorrow for it is naturall now the sorrow for the offending of god is no sensible thing but supernaturall and spirituall and sensible things doe more affect the minde then the other dauid did notably humble himselfe for his sinnes and he did exceedingly mourne for the losse of his son absolom yes and more too then for his sinnes would god i had died for thee absolom o absolom my son my son ampc againe i answer that the sorrow of the minde must be measured by the intention of the affection and by the estimation of the thing for which we sorrow now sorrow for sinne though it be lesse in respect of the intentio therof yet is it greater in respect of the estimation of the minde because they which truly mourne for their sinnes grieue for the offence of god as the greatest euill of all and for the losse of the fauo of god as for losse of the most excelle t amp pre ious thing in the world iv case whether it be necessarie in humiliation that the heart should be smitten with a sensible sorrowe answer i in sorrow for sinne there are two things first to be displeased for our sinnes secondly to haue a bodily moouing of the heart which causeth crying and teares the former of these is necessarie namely in heart to be deepely displeased with our selues the latter is not simply necessarie though it be commendable in whomsoeuer it is if it be in truth for lydia had the first but not the secod ii it falleth out oftentimes that the greatnesse of the griefe taketh away the sensible paine and causeth a nummednesse of the heart so that the partie grieueth not iii sometimes the complexion will not affoard teares amp in such there may be true humiliation though with drie cheekes the second thing to be done for the attaining of god fauour and consequently of saluation is to beleeue in christ in the practise of a christian life the duties of humiliation and faith cannot be seuered yet for doctrines sake i distinguish them in faith there are two things required and to be performed on our behalfe first to know the points of religion and namely the summe of the gospell especially the promise of righteousnesse and life eternall by christ secondly to apply the promise and withall the thing promised which is christ vnto our selues and this is done when a man vpon the commandement of god sets downe this with himselfe that christ and his merits belong vnto him in particular and that christ is his wisdome iustification sanctification and redemption this doctrine is plaine out of the sixt of john for christ is there propounded vnto vs as the bread and the water of life therefore faith must not be idle in the braine but it must take christ and apply him vnto the soule and conscience euen as meate is eaten the questions of conscience touching faith are these first howe we may truely apply christ with all his benefits vnto our selues for wicked man apply christ vnto themselues falsely in presumption but fewe doe it truely as they ought to doe i answer that this may be done we must remember to doe two things first lay downe a foundation of this action and then practise vpon it our foundation must be laid in the word or else we shall faile in our application and it consists of two principles the one is as god giues a promise of life eternall by christ so he giues commandement that euery one in particular should apply the promise to himselfe the next is that the ministerie of the word is an ordinarie meanes wherein god doeth offer and apply christ with all his benefits to the hearers as if he called them by their names peter john cornelius beleeue in christ and thou shalt be saued when we haue rightly considered of our foundation the second thing is to practise vpon it and that is to giue our selues to the exercises of faith and repentance which stand in meditation of the word and praier for mercie and pardon and when this is done then god giues the sense and increase of his grace vvhen lydia was hearing the sermon of paul then god opened her heart act secondly it is demaunded when faith beginnes to breed in the heart and when a man beginnes to beleeue in christ answer vvhen he beginnes to be touched in conscience for his owne sinnes and withall hungers and thirsts after christ and his righteousnesse then beginneth faith the reason is plaine as faith is renewed so it is begunne but it is renewed when a man is touched in conscience for his sinnes and beginnes a new to hunger after christ therefore when these things first shew themselues then faith first begins for these were the things that were in dauid when he renewed his repentance the third dutie necessarie to saluation is repentance in which two things are to be cosidered the beginning namely a godly sorrow corinthian and vpon this sorrowe a change in sorrowe we consider first the nature of it secondly the properties of it touching the nature of sorrow it is either inward or outward the inward sorrow is when a man is displeased with himselfe for his sinnes the outward when the heart declares the griefe thereof by teares or such like signes and sorrow in this case called a godly sorrow is more to be esteemed by the first of these then by the second the propertie of this sorrow is to make vs to be displeased with our selues for our sinnes directly because they are sins amp doe displease god if there were no iudge no hell or death yet we must be grieued because we haue offended so mercifull a god and louing father and as godly sorrowe will make vs thus to doe so is it the next cause of repentance and by this is repentance discerned the next thing in repentance is the change of the minde and whole man in affection life amp conuersation and this standeth in a constant purpose of the mind and resolution of the heart not to sinne but in euery thing to doe the will of god hereupon paul exhorteth them to whome he wrote to continue in the loue of god and in the obedience of his word barnabas when he came to a tioch and had seene the grace of god was glad and exhorted all that with purpose of heart they should cleaue vnto god or continue with the lord so the prophet ezekiel saith if the wicked will turne from all his sinnes and keepe all my statutes and doe that which is lawful and right he shall surely liue and shall not die in this purpose stands the very nature of repentance and it must be ioyned with humiliation and faith as a third thing availeable to saluation and not to be seuered fro them for a man in shew may haue many good things as for exaple he may be hubled amp seeme to haue some strength of faith yet if there be in the said man a want of this purpose amp resolutio not to sinne the other are but dead things amp vnprofitable and for all them he may come to eternall destruction furthermore we must distinguish this kind of purpose from the minde and purpose of carnall man theeues drunkards harlots vsurers for they will confesse their sins and be sory for them yes and shed some teares wishing they had neuer sinned as they haue in these man indeede there is a wishing will for the time but no setled purpose and it is a propertie of nature to auoid euill but to haue a constant resolution of not sinning is a gift of grace and for this it is that we must labour otherwise our repentance is no true and sound repentance the fourth amp last dutie is to performe newe obedience vnto god in our life and conuersation in this newe obedience three things are required first it must be a fruit of the spirit of christ in vs for when we doe any good thing it is christ that doeth it in vs paul saith that good which i doe i doe it not but christ that dwelleth in me secondly this new obedience must be the keeping of euery commandement of god for as saint iames saith he that breaks one commandement is guiltie of all that is he that doeth willingly and wittingly breake any commandement and makes not conscience of some one maketh not conscience of any and before god he is as guiltie of all as if he had broken all thirdly in newe obedience the whole man must endeauour to keepe the whole law in his minde will affections and all the faculties of soule and bodie as it is said of iosiah that he turned to god according to all the lawes of moses with all his heart there are yet three other things required in him that must performe new obedience first he must not liue in the practise of any outward sinne secondly there must be an inward resisting and restraining of the corruption of our nature and of our hearts that we may truely obey god by the grace of the spirit of god the heart of ioseph was readie prest to resist the euill request of potiphars wife and dauid staid his affection from revenging himselfe vpon shemei when he cursed him thirdly he must stirre vp and exercise the inward man by all spirituall motions of faith ioy loue hop eand the praise of god here a necessarie question is mooued cosidering that all good workes are the fruits of a regenerate person amp are contained vnder newe obedience how a man may doe a good worke that may be accepted of god amp please him for resolutio wherof it is to be carefully remebred that to the doing of a good worke sundrie things are required wherof some in nature do goe before the worke to be done some doe accompany the doing thereof and some againe doe followe the worke being required to be done when the worke is done before the worke there goes reconciliation for the person must be reconciled vnto god in christ and be pleasing to him for if the person of the worker doe not please god the worke it selfe cannot neither are workes of what dignitie soeuer to be esteemed by the shevv and outvvard appearance of them but by the mind and condition of the doer againe before vve doe any good vvorke vve must by praier lift vp our hearts vnto god and desire him to inable vs by his spirit to doe it amp to guid vs by the same in the action vvhich vve are about to doe this did the prophet dauid oftentimes as vve may read in the psalmes but especially in psalm when he saith teach me to doe thy will o god for thou article my god let thy good spirit lead me vnto the land of righteousnesse in the doing of the worke we are to consider two things the matter amp the manner or forme of doing it for the matter it must be a worke commanded in the word of god christ saith of the pharises that they worshipped him in vaine teaching for doctrines the commandements of man he therefore that will doe a worke tending to the worshippe of god must doe that which god commandeth and here we must remember that a thing indifferent in the case of off nce comes vnder a commandement of the morall lawe to which purpose paul saith if eating flesh will offend my brother i will eate no flesh while the world standeth his meaning is that though his eating of flesh was a thing indifferet in it selfe yet in case of offence his minde was to abstaine from it as much as from the breach of the law of god againe if an action indifferent comes within the case of furthering the good of the common wealth or church it ceaseth to be indifferent and comes vnder commandement and so all kind of callings and their workes though neuer so base may be the matter of good workes now for the forme of the worke there must be first a generall faith whereby we must be perswaded that the thing to be done may lawfully be done for what soeuer is not of faith is sinne secondly a particular or iustifying faith which purifieth the heart and maketh it fit to bring forth a good worke for it giues a beginning to the worke amp also couers the wants and defects thereof by apprehending and applying vnto vs christ and his merits thirdly it must be done in obedience for knowing the thing to be do e to be commanded of god we must haue a minde and intention to obey god in the thing we doe it will be here demanded seeing workes must be done in obedience how and to what part of the word we must direct our obedience i answer to the law but howe not considered in his rigour but as it is qualified mollified and tempered by the gospel for according to the rigour of the lawe which commandes perfect obedience no man can possibly doe a good worke furthermore the ends of a good worke are manifold first the honour and glory of god whether ye eate or drinke or what soeuer ye doe doe all to the glory of god secondly the testification of our thankefulnes vnto god that hath redeemed vs by christ the third is to edifie our neighbour and to further him in the way to life euerlasting the fourth is to exercise amp confirme our faith and repentance both which be much strengthned by the practise of good workes fiftly that we may escape the punnishment of sinne the destruction of the wicked and obtaine the reward of the righteous life euerlasting sixtly that we may be answerable to our calling in dooing the duties thereof and in walking as children of light redeemed by christ iesus seuenthly that we may pay the debt which we owe vnto god for we are debters to him in sundry regardes as we are his creatures as we are his servant as we are his children in a word as we are redeemed by christ and our whole debt is our duty of praise and thanksgeuing after the worke is done then comes the acception of it god acceptes of our workes diverse waies first in that he pardoneth the fault which comes from vs and secondly in that he approoues his owne good worke in vs we then after we haue done the worke must humble our selues and intreat the lord to pardon the wantes of our workes amp say with dauid lord enter not into iudgement with thy servant and with daniel lord vnto vs belongeth open shame amp cofusion but to thee righteousnes compassion and forgiuenes and the reason is plaine because in vs there is no goodnesse no holines no righteousnes nor any thing that may present vs acceptable in his sight and for this cause paul saith i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not thereby iustified great reason then that we should humble our selues before god for our wants and pray vnto him that he will in mercie accept our indeauour and confirme the good worke begunne in vs by his holy spirit the next generall question touching man as he is a christian is how a man may be in conscience assured of his owne saluation for answer to this question diverse places of scripture are to be skanned wherein this case of conscience is fully answered and resolued the first place is rom and the spirit of god testifieth together with our spirits that we are the sonnes of god in these words are two testimonies of our adoption set downe the spirit of god dwelling in vs amp testifying vnto vs that we are god children and our spirit that is our conscience sanctified and renewed by the holy ghost here put the case that the testimonie of the spirit be wanting then i answer that the other testimonie the sanctification of the heart will suffice to assure vs vve know it sufficietly to be true and not painted fire if there be heare though there be no flame put the case againe that the testimonie of the spirit be wanting and our sanctification be vncertaine vnto vs how then may we be assured the answer is that we must then haue recourse to the first beginnings and motions of sanctification which are these first to feele our inward corruptions secondly to be displeased with our selues for them thirdly to begin to hate sinne fourthly to grieue so oft as we fall and offend god fiftly to auoid the occasions of sinne sixtly to endeauour to doe our dutie and to vse good meanes seuenthly to desire to sinne no more and lastly to pray to god for his grace where these and the like motions are there is the spirit of god whence they proceede and sanctification is begunne one apple is sufficient to manifest the life of the tree and one good and constant motion of grace is sufficient to manifest sanctification againe it may be demaunded what must be done if both be wanting answer man must not dispaire but vse good meanes and in time they shall be assured the second place is the psalme in the first verse whereof this question is propounded namely vvho of all the mebers of the church shall haue his habitation in heauen the answer is made in the verses following and in the second verse he sets downe three generall notes of the said person one is to walke vprightly in sinceritie approouing his heart and life to god the secod is to deale iustly in all his doings the third is for speech to speake the truth from the heart without guile or flatterie and because we are easily deceiued in generall signes in the and verses there are set downe seauen more euident and sensible notes of sinceritie iustice and trueth one is in speech not to take vp or carrie abroad false reports and slanders the second is in our dealings not to doe wrong to our neighbour more then to our selues the third is in our company to contemne wicked persons worthy to be contemned the fourth is in our estimation we haue of others amp that is to honour the that feare god the fift is in our wordes to sweare and not to change that is to make conscience of our word and promise especially if it be confirmed by oath the sixt is in taking of gaine not to giue money to vsurie that is not to take increase for bare lending and to lend freely to the poore the last is to giue testimonie without briberie or partialitie in the fift verse is added a reason of the answer he that in his indeauour doeth all these things shall neuer be mooued that is cut off fro the church as an hypocrite the third place of scripture is the first epistle of john the principall scope whereof is to giue a full resolution to the conscience of man touching the certainty of his saluation and the principall grounds of assurance which are there laid down may be reduced to three heads the first is this he that hath communion or fellowship with god in christ may be vndoubtedly assured of his saluation this conclusion is propounded chap v where the apostle tels the church that the end of the preaching of the gospel vnto them was that they might haue fellowship not onely mutually among themselues but also with god the father and with his son iesus christ and further that hauing both knowledge and assurance of this heauenly communion to be begun in this life and perfected in the life to come their ioy might be full that is they might thence reape matter of true ioy and sound comfort vnto their soules and consciences now whereas it might be haply demaunded by some beleeuers how they should come to this assurance s john answers in this epistle that the certainty thereof may be gathered by foure infallible notes the first is remissio of sins for though god be in himselfe most holy and pure and no mortall man being vncleane amp polluted by sinne can haue fellowship with him yet god hath shewed his mercy to those that beleue in him and hath accepted of the blood of iesus christ his son whereby they are clensed from all their corruptios v if here it be asked how this pardon and forgiuenes may be known it is answered by two signes one is huble amp heartie confession of our sins vnto god for so saith the apostle if we confesse our sins he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sins and to clense vs from all iniquitie v the other is the pacified conscience for being iustified by faith we haue peace with god and if our heart condemne vs not that is if our conscience in respect of sinne doth not accuse vs then haue we boldnesse towards god chap v the secod note of fellowship with god is the sanctifying spirit whereby we are renewed in holines and righteousnes hereby we know that he abideth in vs euen by the spirit which he hath giuen vs chap v the third is holines amp vprightnes of heart amp life to this end the apostle saith if we say that we haue fellowship with him and walke in darknes we lie amp doe not truely but if we walke in the light as he is in the light we haue fellowship one with another ampc chap the fourth is perseuerace in the knowledge and obedience of the gospel so the same apostle exhorteth the church let therfore abide in you that same doctrine cocerning christ which ye haue heard from the beginning if that which ye haue heard from the beginning remaine in you that is if ye beleeue and obey it you also shall continue in the same and in the father chap the second ground he that is the adopted son of god shall vndoubtedly be saued this point the apostle plainely declareth when he saith beloued now are we the sonnes of god and we knowe that is we are vndoubtedly assured by faith that when christ shal appeare in glory we shal be like vnto him for we shall see him as he is that the latter part of these words is thus to be expounded i gather out of chap as also by comparing this text with that of s paul where he saith when christ which is our life shall appeare then shall we also appeare with him in glory and againe if we be sonnes we are also heires euen the heires of god and heires annexed with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him nowe put the case that the conscience of the beleeuer will not rest in this but desires to be further resolued touching the certainetie of his adoption then i answer that he must haue recourse vnto the signes whereby a son of god may be discerned from a child of the deuill and these are principally three first is truely to beleeue in the name of the son of god for those that haue god for their father are made the sonnes of god by faith in iesus christ and this faith shewes it selfe by obedience for hereby we are sure that we knowe christ that is that we beleeue in him and apply him with all his benefits vnto our soules if we keepe his commandements nay further he that saies i knowe him and keepes not his commandements is a liar and the trueth is not in him chap the second signe is a heartie desire and earnest indeauour to be clensed of his corruptions euery son of god that hath this hope purifieth himselfe euen as christ is pure chap verse the third is the loue of a christian because he is a christian for hereby saies the apostle are the children of god known from the children of the deuill because the sonnes of satan doe hate their brother as cain did his brother abel euen for the good workes which they doe on the other side god adopted sonnes may hereby know themselues to be translated from death to life because they loue the brother chap ampc the third ground they that are assured of the loue of god to them in particular may also be certainely assured of their owne saluation this doctrine followes necessarily vpon the apostles words chap v for those whome god hath loued from all eternitie to them he hath manifested his loue by sending his onely begotten son into the world that they might liue through him eternally but howe may a man be assured of god speciall loue and fauour the same apostle answers by two notes the first is the loue of our brother and that according to god commandement wherein it is commanded that he that loues god should loue his brother also andif any man say i loue god and hate his brother be is a liar for howe can he that loueth not his brother whome he hath seene loue god whome he hath not seene nowe that a man deceiue not himselfe in the loue of his brother saint john giues three rules one that christian brotherly loue should not be for outward respects or considerations but principally because they are the sonnes of god and members of christ euery one that loueth him which did beget that is god the father loueth him also which is begotten of him another is that it must not be outward in shew onely but inward in the heart let vs not loue in word or in tongue onely but in deede and in trueth lastly that it be not onely in time of prosperitie but vvhen hee stands in most neede of our loue for whosoeuer hath this worlds good and seeth his brother haue neede and shutteth vp the bovvels of compassion from him howe dvvelieth the loue of god in him the second note of god loue vnto vs is our loue of god for those whome god loueth in christ to them hee giues his grace to loue him againe and this louing of him againe is an euident token of that loue wherewith he loueth them so saith the apostle we loue him because hee loued vs first if it be demaunded howe a man may be assured that he loueth god the answer is hee may knowe it by two things first by his conformitie to him in holinesse the child that loues his father will be willing to tread in the steppes of his father and so in like manner he that loueth god will indeauour euen as hee is so to be in this world but howe is that not in equalitie and perfection but in similitude and conformitie striuing to be holy as he is holy and indeauouring to doe his will in all things secondly by the vveaning of his affection from the things of this world yes from all pleasures and delights of this present life so farre forth as they are seuered from the feare and loue of god loue not this vvorld nor the things that are in the world if any man loue this world the loue of the father is not in him the fourth place is in the second of timothie the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his and let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the lord depart from iniquitie in these wordes paul goeth about to cut off an ofsence which the church might take by reason of the fall of hymenaeus and philetus who seemed to be pillars and principall man in the church and to confirme them against this offence he saith the foundation of god that is the decree of god election stands firme and sure so as those which are elected of god shall neuer fall away as these two haue done and this he declares by a double similitude first of all he saith the election of god is like the foundation of an house which standeth fast though all the building be shaken secondly he saith that election hath the seale of god and therefore may not be chaged because things which are sealed are thereby made sure and authenticall nowe this seale hath two parts the first concerns god in that euery mans saluation is written in the booke of life and god knoweth who are his and because it might be said god indeede knowes who shall be saued but what is that to vs we knowe not so much of our selues therfore saint paul to answer this sets downe a second part of this seale which concerns man and is imprinted in his heart and conscience which also hath two branches the gift of invocation and a watchfull care to make conscience of all amp euery sinne in these words and let euery one that calleth vpon the name of the lord depart from iniquitie vvhereby he signifieth that those that can call vpon god amp giue him thanks for his benefits and withall in their liues make conscience of sinne haue the seale of god election imprinted in their hearts and may assure themselues they are the lord a fift place of scripture touching this question is pet giue all diligence to make your election sure for if you doe these things you shall neuer fall which words containe two parts first an exhortation to make our election sure not with god for with him all things are knowne but to ourselues in our owne hearts and consciences secondly the meanes whereby to come to this assurance that is by doing the things before named in the and verses amp that is nothing else but to practise the vertues of the morall law there set downe which i will briefly shewe what they are as they lie in the text to faith adde vertue by faith he meaneth true religion and that gift of god whereby we put our trust and confidence in christ by vertue he meaneth no speciall vertue but as i take it an honest and vpright life before man shining in the vertues and workes of the morall law by knowledge he meanes a gift of god whereby a man may iudge how to carrie himselfe warily and vprightly before man by temperance is vnderstood a gift of god whereby we keepe a moderation of our naturall appetite especially about meate drinke and attire by patience is meant a vertue whereby we moderate our sorrowe in induring affliction godlines is another vertue whereby we worship god in the duties of the first table brotherly kindnesse is also that vertue whereby we imbrace the church of god amp the members thereof with the bowels of loue and in the last place loue is that vertue wherby we are well affected to all man euen to our enemy now hauing made a rehearsall of these vertues in the tenth verse he saith if ye doe these things ye shall neuer fall that is to say if ye exercise your selues in these things you may hereby be well assured and perswaded of your election and saluation the last generall question touching man as he is a christian is how a man beeing in distresse of minde may be comforted and releiued ans omitting all circumstances considering that much might be spoken touching this question i will onely set down that which i take to be most materiall to the doubt in hand distresse of mind which salomo calls a broke or troubled spirit is whe a ma is disquieted and distempered in conscience and consequently in his affections touching his estate before god this distresse hath two degrees the lesse and the greater the lesse is a single feare or griefe when a man standeth in suspense and doubt of his owne saluation and in feare that he shall be condemned the greater distresse is despaire when a man is without all hope of saluation in his owne sense and apprehension i call dispaire a greater distresse because it is not a distinct kind of trouble of minde as some doe thinke but the highest degree in euery kinde of distresse for euery distresse in the minde is a feare of condemnation and comes at length to desperation if it be not cured all distresse of minde ariseth from temptation either begunne or continued for these two doe so necessarily followe and so inseperably accompany each the other that no distresse of what kind soeuer can be seuered from temptation and therfore according to the diverse sorts of temptations that doe befall man must the distresses of the minde be distinguished now temptations be of two sorts either of triall or seducement temptations of triall are such as doe befall man for the triall and proofe of the grace of god which is in them the temptations of triall are twofold the first is a combate of the conscience directly and immediately with the wrath of god which beeing the most grieuous temptation that can be it causeth the greatest and deepest distresse of conscience the second is the triall of the crosse that is of outward affliction whereby god maketh proofe of the faith of his children and not only that but of their hope patience and affiance in his mercie for their deliuerance temptations of seducement be such as wherin man are entised to fall from god amp christ to any kind of evil and these are of three kinds the first is the temptation of blasphemies or the blasphemous temptation which is from the deuill immediately the second is from a mans owne sinnes originall and actuall and this also hath sundrie branches as we shall see afterward the third proceeds from imagination corrupted and deceiued now answerable to these seuerall kinds of temptations are the seueral kinds of distresses and as all temptations may be reduced to those fiue which haue beene before named so may all distresses be reduced to fiue heads arising of the former temptations before i come to handle them in particular we are to consider in the first place what is the best amp most sure generall remedie which may serue for all these or any other kind of temptation that is incident to man amp by this the curing of any particular distresse will be more easie amp plaine this generall remedie is the applying of the promise of life euerlasting in and by the blood of christ for no physicke no arte or skill of man can cure a wounded and distressed conscience but onely the blood of christ and that this is the soueraigne remedie of all other no man doubteth the maine difficultie is touching the manner of proceeding in the application of the promise herein therefore three things must be performed first of all the partie must disclose the cause of the particular distresse that the remedie may the better be applied for the truth is that the very opening of the cause is a great ease to the minde before any remedie be applyed yet by the way this care must be had that the thing to be reuealed be not hurtefull to the partie to whome it is made knowne for the distresse may happily arise of some confederacie in matters of treason by the concealing whereof the partie to whome they are reuealed may intangle himselfe in the same danger secondly if the cause may be knowne for sometime it is hid from the partie distressed the triall must be made whether the said partie be fit for comfort yes or no for if he be found to be vnfit the word of god shall be misapplyed and consequently abused his fitnesse for comfort may be found out by searching whether he be humbled for his sinnes or not for me may be in great distresse and yet not touched at all for their sinnes this humiliation stands in sorrow for sinne with confession of the same vnto god and in earnest praier for the pardon thereof with an heartie desire of amendment of life but if on the other side the partie be vnhumbled then the first and principall care must be to worke in him some beginning of humiliation this may be done in a freindly and christian talke and conference whereby he must first be brought to see and well to consider his own sinnes secondly to grieue and to be sorrie for them at the least for some of the principall and touching this sorrow two things must be remembred first that the nature of worldly sorrowe must be altered by beeing turned and changed into sorrow according to god if a ma be in some danger of his life by bleeding at the nose experience teacheth the counsell of the phisitian is to open a vaine and let the partie blood in the arme that the course thereof may be turned another way the like order is to be taken with man that are troubled with worldly sorrow in their distresse and that is to turne the course of their griefe by causing them to grieue not for worldly respects or onely in consideration of the punishment due vnto their sinnes but principally for the very offence of god in and by their sinnes committed this done a second care must be had that this sorrow for sinne be not confused but a distinct sorrow the man that is in sorrow must not be grieued onely because he is as other man are a sinner but more specially for this and that particular sinne by which it comes to passe that he is such or such or a sinner that so his sorrow in respect of sinne may be distinct and brought as it were to some particular head and man in this case must deale with the partie distressed as surgeons are woont to doe with a tumour or swelling in the bodie whose manner is first to applie drawing amp ripening plaisters to the place affected to bring the sore to an head that the corruption may issue out at some one place and then afterward healing plaisters which are of great vse to cure the same euen so confused griefe must be reduced to some particulars and then and not before is a man fit for comfort when his conscience is touched in speciall in regard of some one or more distinct and seuerall offences and he that is grieued for one sinne truly and vnfainedly from his heart shall proportionally be grieued for all the sinnes that he knoweth to be in himselfe the third thing required in applying this remedie is the ministring and conuaying of comfort to the mind of him that hath confessed his sinnes and is truly humbled for them and it is a point of the greatest moment of all where if the question be how this comfort should be ministred the answer is it may be done by bringing the partie troubled within the compasse of the promise of life and there be two waies of doing this the one false and the other true some thinke that man may be brought within the couenant by the doctrine of vniuersall grace and redemption but this way to perswade vs of title in the couenant of grace is both false and vnfit false it is because all the promises of the gospel are limited with the condition of faith and repentance not beeing vniuersall but made onely to such persons as repent and beleeue therfore they are indefinite in regard of whole mankind and to beleeuers they are vniuersall it is obiected that god would haue all man to be saued ans the apostle is the best expounder of himselfe and he faith in the acts to the same effect the time of this ignorance god regarded not but now he admonisheth all man euery where to repent in which wordes paul addes this circumstance of time now to limit this good will of god to the last age of the world after the comming of christ in the flesh and not to inlarge the same to all the posteritie of adam and o must he be vnderstood in the place to timothie god would haue all man to be saued that is now in this last age of the world and thus the same apostle corinthian expounds a certaine prophecie of isai concerning the acceptable time of grace now saith he is the acceptable time behold now is the day of saluation meaning the time of the new testamet and column the mysterie hid fro the beginning is now made manifest to the saints and ro the reuelatio of the secret mysterie is now opened all which and many other places about the same matter hauing this circumstance of time now must needs be limited to this last age of the world as for the note of vniuersalitie all it must not be vnderstood of all particulars but of all kinds sorts conditions and states of man as may be gathered out of the former words i would that praiers be made for all man not for euery particular man for there be some that sinne vnto death for whome we may not pray but for all states of man as well princes as subiects poore as rich base as noble vnlearned as learned ampc but the saying of paul is vrged corinthian god was in christ recociling the world vnto himselfe therefore the promise in christ belongs to the whole world amp consequently to euery one ans the same apostle shall againe answer for himselfe rom the casting away of the iewes is the reconciling of the world that is of the gentiles in the last age of the world for so he said before more plainly the falling avvay of the ievv is the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles and so must that place to the corinths be vnderstood namely not of all and euery man that liued in all ages and times but of the that were by the dispensation of the gospel to be called out of all kingdomes and nation after the death and ascenfion of christ thus then the promise of saluation is not vniuersall without exception or restraint and therefore application made by the vniuersalitie of the promise admits some falshood secondly this way of applying is also vnfit for the reason must be framed thus christ died for all man but thou article a man therefore christ died for thee the partie distressed will graunt all and say christ indeede died for him i he would haue receiued christ but he by his sinn hath cut himselfe off from his owne sauiour and hath forsaken him so as the benefit of his death will doe him no good the right way of ministring comfort to a partie distressed followeth in the handling whereof first i will lay downe the grounds whereby any man that belongs to god may be brought within the couenant and then i will shew the right way how they must be vsed and applied for the first recourse must not be had to all graces or to all degrees and measures of grace but onely such as a troubled conscience may feele and reach vnto for those that be the true children of god and haue excellent measure of grace when they are in distresse feele little or no grace at all in themselues the graces then that serue for this purpose are three faith repentance and the true loue of god which is the fruit of them both and that we may the more easily and truly discerne of them and not be deceiued inquirie must be made what be the seedes and beginnings of them all the first gronnd of grace is this a desire to repent and beleeue in a touched heart and conscience is faith and repentance it selfe though not in nature yet in god acceptation i prooue it thus it is a principle graunted and confessed of all man that in them which haue grace god accepteth the will for the deede if there be a willing minde saith the apostle it is accepted not according to that a man hath not but according to that he hath againe god hath annexed a promise of blessednes and life euerlasting to the true and vnfained desire of grace whence it is that they are in scripture pronounced blessed which hunger and thirst after righteousnes and who are they but such as feele themselues to want all righteousnes and doe truly and earnestly desire it in their hearts for hunger and thirst argues both a want of something and a feeling of the want and to this purpose the holy ghost saith to him that is a thirst will i giue to drinke of the water of life freely now this thirstie soule is that man which feeles himselfe destitute of all grace and god fauour in christ and withall doth thirst after the blood of christ and desires to be made partaker thereof god is wont mercifully to accept of the desire of any good thing when a man is in necessitie and stands in want thereof the lord saies dauid heares the desire of the poore that is of them that are in distresse either of bodie or minde yes he will fulfill the desire of them that feare him it will be said that the desire of good things is naturall and therefore god will not regard mens desires i answer desires be of two sorts some be of such things as man by the meere light of nature know to be good for example the desire of wisdome of ciuill vertue of honour of happinesse and such like and all these nature can desire others be aboue nature as the desire of remission of sinnes reconciliation and sanctification and they which seriously desire these haue a promise of blessednes and life euerlasting and hence it followes that desire of mercie in the want of mercie is mercie it selfe and desire of grace in the want of grace is grace it selfe a second ground is this a godly sorrovv whereby a man is grieued for his sinnes because they are sinnes is the beginning of repentance amp indeed for substance is repentance it selfe the apostle paul reioyced that he had in the worke of his ministerie wrought this godly sorrow in the hearts of the corinthians calling it sorrow that causeth repentance not to be repented of this sorrow may be discerned in this sort the heart of him in whome it is is so affected that though there were no conscience nor deuill to accuse no hell for condemnation yet it would be grieued in it selfe because god by sinne is displeased and offended i it be alleadged that euery one cannot reach to this beginning of repentance thus to sorrow for his sinne then i adde further if the partie be grieued for the hardnes of his heart whereby it comes to passe that he cannot grieue he hath vndoubtedly receiued some portion of godly sorrow for it is not nature that makes vs to grieue for hardnes of heart but grace the third ground is that a setled purpose and willing minde to forsake all sinne and to turne vnto god though as yet no outward couersion appeare is a good beginning of true conuersion amp repentance i thought saith dauid i will confesse against my selfe my wickednes vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne and to this is added selah which is not onely a musicall note but as some thinke a note of obseruation to moue vs to marke the things that are set downe as beeing of speciall weight and moment and surely this is a matter of great consequence that vpon the very vnsained purpose of confession of sinne god should giue a pardon thereof take a surther proofe of this in the prodigall son whome i take not for one that was neuer called or turned to god though some doe so and seeme to haue warrant for their opinion but rather for him that is the child of god and afterward falls away now such a one beeing brought by outward crosses and afflictions to see his owne miserie purposeth with himselfe to returne to his father againe and to humble himselfe and confesse his iniquitie and vpon this very purpose when he had said i will goe to my father and say vnto him father i haue sinned ampc at his returne a farre off his father receiues him as his child againe and after acceptation followes his confession the like is to be seene in dauid who beeing reprooued by the prophet nathan for his sinnes of adulterie and murther presently made confession of them and at the very same time receiued by the prophet sentence of absolution euen from the lord himselfe wherein he could not erre the fourth ground to loue any man because he is a christian and a child of god is a sensible and certaine note of a man that is partaker of the true loue of god in christ hereby saith s john we knowe that we are translated from death to life because we loue the brother loue here is not a cause but onely a signe of god loue to vs and our sauiour christ saith he that receiueth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receiue a prophets reward now that we be not deceiued in these grounds it must be rememebred that these beginnings of grace be they neuer so weak must not be flittering and fleeting but constant amp setled not stopped or staied in the way but such as daiely growe and increase and then they are indeed accepted of god and he that can finde these beginnings or any of them truely in himselfe he may assure himselfe thereby that he is the child of god hauing thus laid downethe groundes of cofort i come now to the way by which the party in distresse may be brought within the compasse of the promise of saluation this way standes in two things in making triall and in applying the promise first then triall must be made whether the person distressed haue in him as yet any of the forenamed grounds of grace or not this triall may be made by him that is the comforter in the moouing of certaine questions to the said person and first let him aske whether he beleeue and repent the distressed partie answers no he cannot repent nor beleeue then he must further aske whether he desire to beleeue and repent to this he will answer he doeth desire it with all his heart in the same sort is he to make triall of the other groundes when a man is in the fit of tentation he will say resolutely he is sure to be daned aske him in this fit of his loue to god he will giue answer he hath none at all but aske him further whether he loue a man because he is a christian and a child of god then will he say he doth indeed thus after triall made in this manner some beginnings of faith and repentance will appeare which at the first lay hid for god vseth out of the time of prosperitie by amp in distresse and affliction to work his grace the second point followeth after that by triall some of the foresaid beginnings of grace be found out then comes the right applying of the promise of life euerlasting to the partie distressed and that is done by a kind of reasoning the first part whereof is taken from god word the second from the testimonie of the distressed conscience and the conclusion is the applying of the promise on this manner he that hath an vnfained desire to repent and beleeue hath remission of sinnes and life euerlasting but thou hast an earnest desire to repent and beleeue in christ therefore remission of sinnes and life euerlasting is thine and here remember that it is most conuenient this application be made by the minister of the gospell who in it must vse his ministeriall authoritie giuen him of god to pronounce the pardon for in distresse it is as hard a thing to make the conscience yeild to the promise as to make fire and water agree for though man haue signes of grace amp mercie in them yet will they not acknowledge it by reason of the extremitie of their distresse in this manner vpon any of the former grounds may the troubled and perplexed soule be assured that mercie belongs to it and this i take to be the onely generall and right way of conforting a distressed conscience nowe that the promise thus applyed may haue good successe these rules must necessarily be obserued i one is that the comfort which is ministred be delaied with some mixture of the law that is to say the promise alone must not be applyed but withall mention is to be made of the sinnes of the partie and of the grieuous punishments due vnto him for the same the reason is because there is much deceipt in the heart of man in so much as oftentimes it falleth out that man not throughly humbled beeing comforted either too soone or too much doe afterward becom the worst of all in this respect not vnlike to the iron which being cast into the fire vehemetly hot amp cooled againe is much more hard then it would haue bin if the heat had bin moderate and hence it is that in the ministring of cofort we must somwhat keep the down amp bring them on by litle amp litle to repentance the sweetnesse of comfort is the greater if it be delayed with some tartenesse of the law ii another rule is this if the distressed partie be much possessed with griefe of himselfe he must not be left alone but alwaies atteded with good company for it is an vsuall practise of the deuill to take the vantage of the place amp time when a man is solitarie and depriued of that helpe which otherwise he might haue in societie with others thus he tempted eue when she was apart from her husband and in this regard salomon pronounces a woe to him that is alone but herein doeth his malice most appeare in that he is alway readiest when a man is in great distresse and withall solitarie then vpon the sudden to tempt him to dispaire and to the making away of himselfe iii thirdly the partie in distresse must be taught not to rest vpon his owne iudgement but alwaies to submit himselfe and be content to be aduised by others that are man of wisedome iudgement and discretion a thing to be obserued the rather because the very neglect thereof hath caused sundrie persons to remaine vncomforted for many yeres iv fourthly the partie distressed must neuer heare tel of any fearefull accidents or of any that haue bin in like or worse case the himself is for vpon the very report the distressed conscience will fasten the accident vpon it selfe and therby comonly wil be drawn to deeper griefe or dispaire for the mind afflicted will imagine fearefull things and sometime the very bare naming of the devil will strike terrour amp feare into it v fiftly the partie that is to comfort must beare with all the wants of the distressed as with their frowardnesse peeuishnesse rashnesse and with their distempered and disordered affections and actions yes he must put vpon him as it were their persons beeing affected with their miserie and touched with their sorrowes as if they were his owne grieuing when he seeth them to grieue weeping when they doe weepe and lament vi sixtly he that is the comforter must not be discouraged though after long labour and paines taking there follow small comfort and ease to the partie distressed for vsually it is long before comfort can be receiued and why surely because god hath the greatest stroke in these distresses of minde and brings man thorough all the temptations that he hath appointed before he opens the heart to receiue comfort the church in the canticles seekes for her beleeued but before shee can finde him shee goes about in the citie through the streets and by open places passing by the watchmen theselues and after shee hath vsed all meanes without helpe or hope at length shee finds her beloued him in whome her soule delighteth thus much for the generall remedie of all distresses nowe i come to the particular distresses themselues the first distresse ariseth of a diuine temptation which is a combate with god himselfe immediately and this distresse is when the conscience speaks some fearefull things of god and withall the partie distressed feeles some euident tokens of god wrath examples hereof we shall finde many in the word of god one is the example of righteous iob who hauing beene long in outward afflictions was withall exercised with the apprehension of the anger of god and in that state he saith that the arrows of the almightie were in him that the venime thereof did drinke vp his spirit that the terror of god did fight against him yes further he addeth that god was his enemie and writ bitter things against him and made him to possesse the sinnes of his youth and at another time he complaineth that god wrath had torne him that he hated him g ashed vpon him with his teeth and had sharpened his eies against him in all which and diverse other places it appeares that his conscience was exercised with the sense of the wrath of god which had nowe euen seazed vpon his soule another example we haue in dauid who also was exercised with this temptation and trouble of minde as the first wordes of the psalme and the whole tenour thereof doe euidently shewe for first he desires the lord not to rebuke him in his wrath and afterward complaineth that his griefe was so great that his very flesh consumed his bones were vexed and his bodie brought to such a state as no sicknesse could haue brought him vnto and it is not vnlike that the same prophet did often fall into the like kind of distresse of minde as may be gathered out of psalme and sundrie other places now as it fared with these and diverse other servant of god in ancient times so are we not without some instances thereof in our daies amongest many that worthy man master luther writes of himselfe that he was in this particular temptation and that he learned in it the doctrine of the iustification of a sinner by the meere mercie of god without any merit of workes and vpon the sense and experience of the nature and properties of this distresse he w ote notable exposition of the psalme of dauid e scope and intent whereof he writeth to be nothing else but a soueraigne remedie of this and the like distresses of the minde and conscience if it be demanded what is the occasion of this kinde of temptation i answer that it ariseth some times vpon the commission of some notorious sinne which doth wound the conscience as in cain iudas and saul who for their great and capit all sinnes that stinged and wounded their consciences grew to a fearefull state and consequently perished in this temptation sometimes againe it comes when there is no sinne committed but obedience to god performed and then there cannot be rendred any reason of it either in man or out of man saue this that god will haue it so to be and the trueth hereof is plaine by the examples of iob and dauid before remembred the effects of this temptation are many and very strange for outwardly it works vpon the bodie as it were a burning ague amp it causeth the entralls to rise the liuer to rowle in the bodie amp it sets a great heat in the bones amp consumes the flesh more then any sicknes can doe and that it is so as i say beside experience it is cleare in the word of god dauid in this distresse affirmeth that his eyes were eaten as it were with wormes and sunke into his head psalm that his moisture became as the drought in sommer psalm and iob saies that his skinne was blacke vpon him his bones were burnt with heat yes that by meanes of this distresse he was now full of wrinkles and his leanenes did rise vpon him it is a principle which physitians doe hold that the minde follows the temperature of the bodie and is affected according to the good or euill constitution thereof which though it be true yet withall it is as manifest on the other side that the bodie doth often follow the state and condition of the minde for a distressed heart must of necessitie make a fainting and a languishing bodie but the principall thing to be sought for in this temptation is the remedie thereof whereunto there be fiue things required which are to be practised as occasion shall be offered first choise must be made of the most fit and present remedie and that must be vsed in the first place now the most fit and present remedie is to bring the partie troubled to the personall exercises of faith and repentance by and in him selfe for this ende he must examine his conscience most straigthly and narrowly of all the sinnes of his heart and life secondly he must humbly confesse against himselfe all his knowne sinnes and withall acknowledge the due condemnation that he thereby hath deserued thirdly he must crie to heauen for mercie intreating the lord most instantly for pardon and for the restraint of his wrath due vnto him for his sinne dauid beeing in this distresse performed all these duties as we may read in the psalme and he saith further of himselfe that whilst he concealed his sinnes the hand of god was heauie vpon him but vpon his earnest confession and deprecation he receiued mercie and if we read the booke of iob we shall finde that the principall scope thereof is this namely to shew vnto vs that iob was throughly exercised with this temptation and that in the ende hauing beene rebuked both by his friends and by god himselfe his recouerie was made by humbling himselfe when he saith behold i am vile againe now i abhorre my selfe and repent in dust and ashes some may here demand if it fall out that the person himselfe cannot performe any good dutie of himselfe by reason of his distraction in soule and bodie what must then be done ans if the partie can but sigh and sobbe vnto god for mercie and comfort it is no doubt a worke of god spirit and a practise both of faith and repentance we knovv not saith saint paul what to pray as we ought namely in our distresses but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighs that cannot be expressed and therein lies our comfort thus moses at the redde sea beeing in great distresse amp not knowing what to say or doe sighed and groned inwardly in his soule vnto the lord for helpe and protection and his very desire was in stead of a loud crie in the eares of the lord the second thing is that triall must be made whether the partie hath in him any tokens of grace or not these tokens are the small beginnings of grace which before i haue declared as for example a griefe because we cannot grieue for sinne as we should a serious will and desire to beleeue and repent a purpose to sinne no more and such like if these be found in the partie then by them as by sure pledges he may bee assured of the fauour of god towardes him and where any of these be found the saying of god to saint paul must be vrged my grace is sufficient for thee and therewith must the distressed partie stay his minde yes we are to be content with any condition in this life be it neuer so miserabie so long as we are in the fauour of god though he should lay vpon vs euen the paines of hell till the time of our death so did dauid who when he was pursued by his owne son vttered these words vnto god behold if i please thee not doe with me what thou wilt and the like was the minde of paul who beeing assured of the fauour of god was content for his glorie and the saluation of the israelites if it had beene possible to be separated from christ and to indure the very pangs of hell the third thing in this cure is to applie to the said distressed partie such promises of god made vnto afflicted persons as are most large and comfortable for example that the lord is neere to them that are of a contrite heart and vvill saue such as be afflicted in spirit psalm againe i came not saith our sauiour christ but to the lost sheepe of the house of israel matth he saies not to the straying sheepe but to such as ate now in the pit readie to be drowned or in the lyons mouth readie to be deuoured againe the spirit of the lord is vpon me therefore he hath annointed me that i should preach the gospel to the poore that is to such as are distressed in conscience and poore in spirit he hath sent me that i should heale the broken hearted that i should preach deliuerance to the captiues these and many other such like promises are in this case to be vrged and the partie mooued to indeauour to beleeue them and to rest himselfe vpon them though he loose all things els fourthly the partie must be brought to a serious consideration of his life past and of god mercifull dealing with him in former times and therewith is he to be comforted for the time present for if aforehand he hath receiued any tokens of the fauour and loue of god by them he is now to stay and o settle his minde the reason is plaine the gifts of god are without repentance whome he loueth once he loueth to the ende and whome he chooseth he calleth iustifieth and sanctifieth and will also in time glorifie dauid beeing in such affliction that he could hardly thinke vpon god yet he tooke this course praied to the lord for comfort communed with his owne heart and called to remembrance how god had formerly dealt with him and with this meditation of the continuall course of god mercie in his preseruation he confirmed his faith and staied his heart in his greatest troubles the fifth and last thing to be done is the remooueall of such reasons and doubts as the partie distressed vsually makes against himselfe for his owne ouerthrow for it is the manner of those that are troubled in minde to dispute against themselues and commonly they are woont to alleadge three things first beeing instructed how to humble themselues and to depend on god mercie they will graunt that all these indeede are good things but they belong not to them for they neither doe nor can feele any thing but the tokens of god anger and that they are alreadie entred into some degrees of condemnation this obiection may be taken away by informing them of the manner of god dealing in all his workes for commonly he workes all things in his creatures in and by contraries if we could know the whole frame of them thus in the creation euery creature had his beeing of that which had no beeing and something was made not of something but of nothing after the flood the signe of god couenant for the preseruation of the world from destruction by raine is the raine bow which indeede is a naturall signe of raine when elijah was to prooue the lord to be the onely true god against the idolatrous priests of baal and that by burnt offerings he powred water vpon the sacrifice and fills a trench with water round about and in this contrarie meanes was the sacrifice burnt vp christ for the curing of a blind man tepers spittle amp clay together which in all reason is a fitter means to put out the eyes the to cause the blind to see thus in the worke of our redemption christ giues life not by life but by death and he sendes man to heauen by the gates and suburbes of hell he will not build vpon an olde foundation but he pulls downe and destroies all that man may haue no hope at all in himselfe but that all the hope he hath may be in god first he kills and then he makes aliue as anna speaketh first he woundeth and then he healeth he makes man to sowe in teares that afterward he may reape in ioy and he that knoweth god dealing to be this must herewith rest content and satisfied because in wrath god vseth to remember his mercie yes his mercie is neuer sweete vnto the palate of the soule vntill it be seasoned with some tast of his wrath the paschall lambe was eaten with sowre hearbs to signifie that we can feele no sweetnes in the blood of christ till we first feele the smart of our owne sinnes amp corruptions secondly these persons vse to alleadge against themselues that if they could feele any cofort at all then they would stay their minds and yeild to good perswasions amp exhortations to this the answer is that there is a rule of grace which we must follow gathered out of the word of god and the experience of god children contrarie to the rule of nature and aboue the light of reason and it is this that in case of affliction we must not liue by feeling but by faith this rule is grounded vpon the speech of the lord by the prophet the iust man shall liue by his faith when we haue neither sight nor sense nor any tast of god mercie but onely apprehend his wrath euen then we must labour to lay hold of mercie in his word and promise sense and feeling are not alwaies fit directions for the time of this life for he may be the deare child of god that in prsent feeleth nothing but his wrath and indignation this indeede is the true triall of our faith when euen aboue and against reason we relie on the mercie of god in the apprehension of his anger so did dauid out of the deepe saith he that is beeing nowe deepely plunged into the pangs of a distressed conscience haue i called vpon thee o lord and iob in the like case lord though though thou kill me yet will i trust in thee abraham is commended by the holy ghost amongest other things for this that he beleeued in god aboue hope that is against all matter of hope that might possibly be conceiued vpon the consideration of the strength of naturall causes the theife vpon the crosse feeling nothing but woe and seeing nothing in christ but misery amp contempt yet he beleeued in christ and was saued in a word christ himselfe when he was forsaken of all man and voide of all worldly comfort and felt nothing but the depth of the wrath of god in his agonie and passion yet by the faith of his manhood he staied himselfe and said my god my god thirdly they vse to plead that their case is desperate that neuer any was in such a state as they are neuer any touched with the like distresse of minde answer it is false for the holy ghost hath penned three notable places of scripture the booke of iob amp two psalmes of dauid wherein are propounded vnto vs the examples of iob and dauid god owne deare servant who were in as great distresse as euer they or any other haue beene and they may not thinke that they euer could be able to indure greater paines then christ who notwithstanding in the anguish of his soule vpon the crosse cried out my god my god why hast thou for saken me and thus much touching the first kind of trouble of conscience called the diuine temptation the second kind of distresse is that which ariseth from outward afflictions by afflictions i vnderstand all manner of miseries and calamities in this life from the least to the greatest from the paine of the little finger to the very pangs of death nowe the question is howe the trouble of minde arising by afflictions may be remedied for the answer of which question two things are required of the partie distressed practise and meditation the practise is that which is to be vsed in all distresses of minde whatsoeuer and it is a diligent examination of the conscience in regard of sinne an earnest and heartie confession thereof vnto god amp deprecation that is earnest praier vnto him for the pardon of the same these three things beeing done truely and vnfainedly from the heart are a present remedie against this trouble and bring with them much comfort manasses the king of iudah that had committed much wickednesse when he was carried captiue to babel and there put in chaines he humbled himselfe acknowledged his sinnes and praied earnestly vnto the lord and the issue was good for god was intreated of him amp gaue him deliuerance iob beeing long in outward affliction humbled himselfe in like manner and at length receiued comfort daniel humbled himselfe before god for his owne sinnes and for the sinnes of god people making request vnto god earnestly for them and euen when he was in the acte of praying the lord sent his angel gabriel to giue him notice of deliuerance lastly the church of god vnder the crosse performed the like dutie let vs search and trie our waies and turne to the lord and god in mercie gaue an eare vnto her mourning and lamentation by all these places it is apparent that there is no better remedie in the world for the minde of man grieued by meanes of outward afflictions then the practise of the duties before named the next thing vnto practise is the meditation of the comfortable doctrines that are set downe in the word of god touching afflictions all which doctrines may be reduced to fiue principall and maine grounds of comfort shall be laid down in their order the first ground is that all afflictions from the least to the greatest doe come to passe not by accident chance or fortune but by the speciall prouidence of god i explaine it thus in euery particular crosse and affliction there is the hand of god particular prouidence and that in three regards first because god decreeth and foreappointeth euery particular crosse marke the wordes of paul whome god hath foreknowne them he hath predestinate to be made like vnto the image of his son and what is this image nothing else but a conformitie vnto christ in afflictions for this life and in glorie for the life to come nowe if god hath decreed that those whome he foreknewe should be conformable vnto his son in these respects then hath he also decreed the afflictions themselues secondly god doeth not onely barely permit afflictions to be but also he effecteth them and brings them into execution as they are crosses corrections trialls and punishments i make peace saith the lord and i create euill that is not the euill of sinne but of punishment which is euill in our sense and feeling for things are tearmed euill two waies some are euill indeed some are euill not indeed but in regard of our sense apprehension and estimation and of this latter sort are afflictions which god is said to create and to this purpose is the saying of the prophet amos shall there be euill in the citie and the lord hath not done it thirdly as god causeth afflictions so he ordereth and disposeth them that is he limiteth amp appointeth the beginning the end the measure or quantitie and the continuance thereof yes he also ordereth them to their right endes namely his owne glorie the good of his servant and the benefit of his church thus god is said to correct his people in iudgement that is so as he will haue the whole ordering of the correction in his owne hand ioseph tells his brother that when they intended euill against him in selling him to the ishmaelites for siluer god disposed it for good when shemei cursed dauid he forbade his servant so much as to meddle with him and why because saith he the lord bade him to curse and who then dare say vnto him why hast thou done so and to this purpose the prophet dauid saith i held my peace and said nothing why because thou lord hast done it psalm here some will say if afflictions did come onely from god it were somewhat but oftentimes they come from man that beare vs no good will and therefore no maruell though we be impatient answer when crosses doe come from man god vseth them as instruments to execute his iudgements vpon vs and in this worke god is the cheife doer and they are as tooles in the hand of the workeman and the lord inflicteth them vpon vs by man to trie our patience vnder the crosse ioseph though he knewe well the badde dealing of his brother towards him yet he looked not to them alone but to an higher cause namely the lord himselfe who executed his owne good will by them god saith he disposed it to good and againe god did send me before you into egypt for your preseruation the second ground is the commandement of god touching the crosse and obedience vnto him therein this commandement is expressed luke where we are commanded to take vp our crosse euery day and follow christ abraham was commanded with his own hands to sacrifice his onely son isaac and to this comandement though otherwise a great crosse vnto him he addresseth himselfe to yeeld obedience and in the prophecie of micah the church saith shee will beare the wrath of the lord that is shee will performe obedience to him in the crosse because shee had sinned against him and s peter saith that god resisteth the proud and giueth grace to the humble therefore humble your selues vnder the mightie hand of god and this beeing the commandement of god that we should yeild obedience to him in euery affliction we ought to be no lesse carefull to obey it then any one commandement of the morall lawe the third ground is that god will be present with his servant in their afflictions vpon this ground dauid comforts himselfe because god had promised to heare him to be with him in trouble and to deliuer him and in another place though i should walke in the shaddowe of death i would feare none ill for thou article with me ampc nowe that we may the better vnderstand this doctrine we are to consider what be the ends or effects of god beeing with vs in a fliction whereby he testifieth his presence and they are three the first is to worke our deliuerance from the crosse call vpon me saith the lord in the day of thy trouble and i will deliuer thee this promise must not be vnderstood simply but with an exception so farre forth as it shall be for our good for all promises of temporall deliuerance are conditionall and must be conceiued with this limitation of the crosse and chastisement if god please to impose it some may say how if god will not deliuer vs but leaue vs in the affliction what comfort shall we then haue answer in the second place therefore we must remember that god will temper and moderate our afflictions so as we may be able to beare them habbakuk praieth vnto god in the behalfe of the church that he would in wrath remember mercie and paul saith that the lord will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able to beare but will giue an issue with the temptation thirdly put the case that god doeth not moderate our afflictions but suffer them to remaine vpon vs not onely for some time of our life but to the very death yet then will be testifie his holy presence another way namely by giuing the partie distressed power and strength to beare his affliction vnto you it is giuen saith paul for christ that not onely ye should beleeue in him but also suffer for his sake the fourth ground of comfort in affliction is that euery affliction vpon the servant of god hath some speciall goodnesse in it rom we know that all things worke together for good vnto them that loue god and in regard hereof the crosses which are indured by god children are so farre from beeing preiudiciall to their saluation that they are rather helpes and furtherances of the same now this goodnes is perceiued two waies first by the fruit and effect of it and then by the qualitie and condition thereof in both which respects afflictions are good touching the fruits of afflictions because they are manifold i will reduce them to seauen principall heads i afflictions doe make man to see amp consider their sinnes iosephs brother for twentie yeares together were little or not at all troubled for their wickednes in selling their brother yet vpon their affliction in egypt they beganne to consider what they had done we haue say they verily sinned against our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soule when he be sought vs and we would not heare him therefore is this trouble come vpon vs manasses in the time of his peace gaue himselfe to witchcraft and the worshipping of strange god but when he was captiue in babylon then was he brought to the sight of his sinnes and mooued to humble himselfe before god for them ii afflictions serue to humble man in their soules before god the young vnthrift in the gospel called the prodigall child while his portion lasted he spent liberally and was grieued for nothing but when he came to be pinched with hunger and that through his owne follie then he humbled himselfe before his father and returned home vnto him dauid saith of himselfe that in his prosperitie he thought he should neuer be mooued because the lord of his goodnes had made his mountaine to stand strong but saith he thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled then cried i vnto the lord iii they serue to worke amendement of life no chastising saith the author to the hebrewes for the present seemeth to be ioyous but aftervvard it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnes to them that are thereby exercised that is afflictions and chastisments that seaze vpon god children doe leaue after them amendment of life as the needle passeth through the cloath and leaueth the threed behinde it when we are iudged saith the apostle vve are nurtered of the lord that we might not be condemned with the world and dauid confesseth psalm it is good for me that i haue beene afflicted that i might learne thy statutes and the good husbandman purgeth and pruneth the vine that it may bring forth more and better fruit iiii they cause man to denie themselues and to rely wholy on the mercy of god thus paul receiued the sentence of death in himselfe that he should not trust in himselfe but in god that raiseth the dead v the fi t is inuocation for afflictions make vs to crie hartelie and feruently vnto god to bringe our selues into his presence and there to abase our selues before him thus the lord saith of his children that in their affliction they will seeke him diligently vi the sixth is patience affliction bringeth forth patience patience experience ampc as if he should say because the loue of god is shed in our hearts therefore in afflictions we are patient now whilst we patiently beare the crosse we haue experience of the mercie and loue of god towardes vs and hauing once in some notable deliuerance tried and tasted the mercie of god we doe by hope as it were promise to our selues the said fauour and mercy for time to come vii the last fruit is obedience this the holy ghost teacheth to haue beene the fruit of the suffering of christ when he saith though he were the son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered in the next place afflictions are good in regard of their qualitie and condition which is that they are tokens and pledges of our adoption when we make the best vse of them if ye indure chastening saith the holy ghost god offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes that is he comes to you in the crosse not as a iudge and reuenger but as a kind and louing father and the crosse imposed is as it were his fatherly had where with he chastiseth vs and therefore iob praiseth god for his affliction saying god hath giuen and god hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord the fifth ground of comfort is that the partie distressed hath partners in the crosse for first he hath christ to be his partner because he hath fellowship with him in that he is afflicted and is willing to obey god therein paul accounteth it happines to know the fellowshippe of christs afflictions and to be made conformable vnto his death philipp secondly if the partie afflicted repent christ communicateth with him in all his crosses and accounts them as his owne the apostle in this regard would haue no man thinke it strange no not when he is in the fierie triall but rather to reioyce because he is partaker of christs sufferings philipp and christ saith to saul persecuting his church saul saul why persecutest thou me thirdly he that is afflicted hath other servant of god partakers with him in all his afflictions the apostle peter wisheth the church of god to resist sathan by faith knowing saith he that the same afflictions are accoplished in your brother that are in the world pet thus much generally of afflictions and of comfort in them it were a long and tedious worke to set all downe in particular together with their proper and distinct comforts therfore i will passe them ouer and speake onely of three kinds of afflictions with their remedies the first is the deferring of deliuerance a great affliction if it be considered and touching it i propound one question namely how the minde of the partie distressed may be staied when as the lord deferres deliuerance for the answer hereof three especiall points are to be considered i first that god hath in his wisdome set downe certen and vnchangeable times for the accomplishment and issue of all things that are there is a time appointed to euery thing vnder the sun ecclesiastes the speech of salomon is generall and the meaning of it is this whatsoeuer there is in the world either done or suffered or enioyed by man whether it be of the number of naturall things or of those which are voluntarily vndertaken or necessarily endured god hath in his prouidence sorted vnto them a set time and season whereof dependeth the successe of the all and this time himself most freely ordereth and ruleth at his owne good pleasure which as no man can hinder or stay so is it not in the power of any to hasten or preuet this point the holy ghost in scripture prooueth by two instances of the threatnings and promises of god which himselfe accomplisheth at some certaine and vnchangeable times when the old world in the daies of noah had growne to much impietie and wickednes the lord appointed a certaine space of yeares for their repentance and conuersion at the very ende and tearme whereof he brought the flood vpon them and not before for if we compare the particular circumstances of time noted in the of genesis with that which s peter writeth pet we shall find that the inundation of water came vpon the earth at the very point of time before determined againe god threatned by ieremie that the iewes for their sinnes should be led captiue and serue the king of babel yeares now if we take the iust computation of time it will appeare that so soone as euer those yeares were expired the foresaid threat was accomplished and therefore daniel alluding to ieremies prophecie exactly setteth it downe when he saith the same night was belshazzer king of the chaldeans slaine that is the very night wherein those yeares came to their full period and as there are set times allotted by god for the execution of his threatning sentences so also hath he determined certenly the accomplishment of all and euery of his promises an example hereof we haue in the israelites of whome the lord said to abraham that they should be in afflictio in a strange land yeres amp then be deliuered this promise of god was expressely fulfilled as we may read in the booke of exodus for before the ende and tearme of these yeares they had no deliuerance at all but when that time was expired euen that selfe same day departed all the hosts of israel out of the land of egypt and though moses fourtie yeares before this time tooke in hand the worke of their deliuerance yet he did it without successe and vpon a certaine accident beeing himselfe constrained to flie into madian he liued there as a stranger with iethro his father in law till the saide time of foure hundred and thirtie yeares was accomplished toward the end whereof being called of god to that office he prospered and not before and in the same manner hath god set downe a certen period of time within which he will exercise his children more or lesse and at the end whereof and not before he will releeue and comfort them againe now as the certentie of the accomplishment of god threatning word serues to terrifie all wicked liuers from sinne so the vnchangeable performance of his promises at the very time prefixed and not before teacheth the children of god sundrie things first that when they are in any distresse and haue not present or speedie deliuerance according to their desire they should wait the lord leisure and expect with patience till the time come which is appointed by him for their case and releefe and in the meane while stay their hearts by hope and affiance in his mercie reason is plaine god is sure in his word therefore though heauines may indure for a night yet ioy will returne in the morning psalm thus the lord comforteth the iewes in a particular distresse as we may read in the prophecie of habbakuk where the prophet in the name of the iewes complaineth and expostulateth the matter with god why his owne people should be so lamentably afflicted by a terrible and a furious nation and why they should be led away captiues by the chaldeans the enemy of god to this the lord makes answer that as he had certenly determined that iudgement to come vpon them so certenly had he appointed a set time wherein they should be deliuered in the meane while he biddes them to comfort themselues in this that though the affliction should rest vpon them for a season yet vndoubtedly they should be cased at the length and therefore that they should in patience waite for the vision that is the accomplishment of the vision touching their deliuerance secondly hence we learne that we must not onely beleeue the promises of god in generall that god is true and faithfull in them and that he is able and willing to fulfill them euen as he made them but we must beleeue them in particular that is with application to their proper and seuerall circumstances which are the particular meanes places and times whereby and wherein he hath giuen his word as touching our freedome and exemption from the crosse take an instance hereof in the prophet daniel who knewe well by the spirit of prophecie that the lord had determined to bring vpon the iewes yeares captiuitie in babylon he knewe also that god had promised to put an ende to that captiuitie at the end and tearme of those yeares nowe what did daniel in this case vpon knowledge of the will of god in that point during the said time he praied not vnto the lord for deliuerance of his people but when he vnderstood that the time drew neere wherein it was the will of god that the iewes should returne out of captiuitie then by faith applying the promise of god to that particular time he besought the lord in praier and supplications with fasting in sackcloath and ashes and the lord gaue eare vnto his praiers amp yeelded him a gratious answer ii the second point is that god when he deferres deliuerance he doeth it vpon great and waightie causes and considerations best known to himselfe the first whereof is that thereby he might humble man throughly and bring them to an vtter deniall of themselues and consequently cause them to learne patience in afflictio which they would not learne if they might be their owne caruers and haue speedie deliuerance from the crosse at their owne wils amp pleasures secondly that beeing afflicted they may acknowledge whence their deliuerance comes yes whence they doe receiue not onely that but euery other good benefit which they inioy namely not from themselues or any creature but onely from the lord and accordingly may learne to value and prize his gifts at their deserued excellencie for it is a true saying and often verified in affliction and want that benefits easily obtained are lightly regarded and sooner forgotten thirdly that by the continuance of the crosse without intermission he may make the to distaste the world and consequently drawe them to the meditation of the life to come wherein all matter of mourning shall cease and all teares shall be wiped from their eies fourthly the lord deferreth deliuerace from affliction that he might preuent greater euils and dangers whereinto those that are afflicted might runne if they had their hearts desire and were eased not at his will but at their owne wishes when the children of israel came into canaan they were informed that they should dwell together with the canaanites and moses redreth a reason therof least saith he the wild beast of the field multiply against thee and for the preuenting of this euill the israelites must indure some annoyance by the canaanites euen so the lord keepeth his servant vnder the crosse for the preuenting of greater sinnes and offences this should stay the mindes of man amp make them content to waite vpon god for deliuerance when they are afflicted the third and last point is that god alwaies hath and doeth exercise his best servant with long and continued crosses abraham was childlesse till he was yeares of age and at those yeares the lord promised him issue but this promise was not accomplished till a long time after when he was an hundred yeares old dauid had a promise to be king of ierusalem and iuda but the lord exercised him by many and grieuous afflictions before he came to the crowne in so much that he saies of himselfe that his eies failed with waiting vpon his god zachary and elizabeth praied to god both of them in their youth and many yeares after for issue but the lord graunted not their request till they were olde to adde no more examples by these we see the lord dealing euen with holy man amp woman his owne deare servant that he doth not alwaies grant their requests nor condescend to their desires at the first but as it were holds the off amp suspends his grace and fauour for a time and therefore if it shall please him thus to deale with any of vs we must fro these examples be taught to possesse our soules with patience resting contented in his will and waiting on his good pleasure to the end to conclude this point suppose that the condition of god servant be such as that they find no end of their afflictions but that they do continue euen vnto death what shall they doe in this case ans besides that which hath beene said before for the resolution of this question i answer further that first they must still euen vnto death liue by faith and say with holy iob lord though thou kill me yet will i trust in thee secondly they must stay and releiue their soules in the meane time with these and such like meditations i that it is the will and pleasure of god that we should through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of god act nowe it is the propertie of a true child of god to rest content in his fathers good will and pleasure euen when he is afflicted prou my sonnebe not grieued at my correction that is let it not be tedious vnto thee be content to beare it our dutie therefore is meekely to subiect our selues vnto the hand of god as the child doeth vnto the correction of his father ii that though afflictions be long and tedious yet god will at length giue a ioyful amp comfortable issue for so himselfe hath promised math blessed are they that mourne for they shall be comforted psalm great are the troubles of the righteous but the lord will deliuer him out of the all marke the vpright man amp behold the iust for the end of that ma is peace iii afflictions be they neuer so heauy in regard of continuance yet they are in no sort coparable to those eternal ioies that god hath prepared for the that loue him this was pauls meditatio who indured the crosse eue to his dying day our light afflictio saith he which is but for a moment worketh vnto vs an excellent and eternal waight of glory and elswhere he professeth that he did not count the afflictions of this present time answerable in value to the glorie which shall be reuealed vnto god children ro saint peter tels them to whome he wrote that in regard of their assured hope of eternall life they should reioice though now for a season they were in heauinesse through manifold tentations pet lastly the author to the hebrewes comforteth the church by this reason because it is is yet a very little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarrie iv though god with holdeth his hand in respect of deliuerance euen to death yet his loue is constant and vnchangeable and the crosse which we vndergoe cannot seperate vs from that loue wherewith he hath loued vs in iesus christ rom and thus much of the first particular distresse of minde the second kind of afflictio is bodily amp temporarie death which consisteth in the seperation of the soule from the bodie and touching this affliction it is demanded how any servant of god may be able to indure with comfort the pangs of death for the answer hereof two things are required a preparation to death and helpes in the time of death concerning preparation there are three duties to be performed the first and most principall is commended vnto vs in the booke of psalmes where dauid praies vnto god lord make me to know mine ende and the measure of my daies and moses in like manner lord teach me to number my daies that i may apply my heart vnto wisedome in which places is remembred a notably dutie of preparation to wit that a man should resolue himselfe of death continually and afore hand number his daies and this is done by esteeming of euery day as the day of his death and accordingly doing alwaies that which he would doe if he were now to giue vp the ghost secondly in way of preparation we must indeauour to disarme and weaken death who is as an armed man that hath his weapons whereby he seekes to destroy vs and in this case we must deale with death as the philistims dealt with sampson they saw by experience that he was a mightie man and by his power and strength had giuen them many foyles and therefore they laboured to knowe in what part of his bodie his strength did lie and after inquirie finding it to be in the haire of his head they neuer rested till they had spoiled him thereof and questionlesse the time wil come when we all must encounter with this strong and powerfull sampson death in the meane while it is a point of wisdome to inquire wherein his power amp might consisteth when this search hath bin made we shall finde that his weapons are our manifold sinnes and corruptions both of heart and life for as paul saith the sting of death is sinne therefore that we may spoile him of this his furniture we must exercise our selues in the practise of two duties first vse all meanes for the cutting off of the locke of our sinnes whereby alone satan hath the vantage of vs and these meanes are the duties of inuocation and true repentance we must therefore be instant in praier for the pardon of our sinnes past and present and in this point giue the lord no rest vntill we haue obtained in our consciences the sweete certificate of his fauour and mercie in christ whereby our minds may be staied and comforted this done it stands vs in hand to turne vnto god to be carefull to leaue sinne to entertaine in our hearts a resolued purpose and intention of newe obedience and conformitie to the will and commandement of god in all things and this is the onely way in the world to bereaue this our enemie of his armour to pull the sting out of the mouth of this serpent and consequetly euen in death to preuaile against him thirdly in way of preparation our dutie is euen afore hand while we liue in this world to indeauour to haue some true taste of life euerlasting and the ioyes of heauen the due consideration whereof will be of great vse for it will stirre vp in our hearts a desire and loue of perfect happinesse in heauen yes a feruent expectation of christs comming to iudgement and it will further cause vs to say with simeon lord now let thy servant depart in peace and with the apostle i desire to be dissolued and be with christ touching this spirituall ioy and comfort in the holy ghost these questions of conscience are mooued first how may we in this life haue and nourish in our hearts a true tast of eternall happinesse and of the ioyes of the world to come ans first by a serious consideration of the euills that doe hinder or preiudice our happines and they are principally foure one is the miserie of our liues in respect of sinne and the consequen s thereof for there is no man in the world be he neuer so righteous that can truly say of himselfe i am cleane from my sinne prou yes euen the regenerate that haue receiued grace to beleeue to urne vnto god and to liue according to the spirit doe finde by experience corruption and rebellion in their minds wills and affections which daily affordeth matter of sinning against god and on the other side hindreth and quencheth all the good motions of the spirit that are in them againe such is the irreconciliable malice of satan that he taketh vantage of mans corruption and neglecteth no time or opportunitie to intrappe the children of god in the snares of his temptations and hence it is that man by reason of his owne corruption and the wicked suggestions of the deuill is at continuall strife with himselfe hath daily occasion of sorrow worketh out his saluation with feare and trembling wading as it were euen while he liueth in a sea of many miseries the second euill is the vanitie of all things that are in the world for whether we consider the world it selfe or the things therein contained done or suffered there is nothing so sure and steadie whereunto man hauing attained can possibly rest fully satisfied and contented or which in the ende will not prooue to be most vaine vanitie and the truth hereof appeareth in the experience of salomon himselfe who beeing king ouer israel wanted neither authoritie nor abilitie amp opportunitie to take knowledge and triall of all worldly things in all estates and conditions and hauing euen of set purpose carefully and earnestly searched into them all at length he concludes that the issue of all was vnprofitable vanitie and vexation of minde as we may read in his ecclesiastes the third euill is the changeable condition of our life in this world whereby it comes to passe that we are alway in a fleeting and transitorie state for we are as s peter speaketh but strangers and pilgrimes that wander to and fro in the earth as in a strange countrey and still are making forward to our owne home we haue here no abiding citie the houses wherein we dwell are but innes in which we soiourne for a time yes the body which we haue are but tents and tabernacles alway readie to be shifted and our selues to be traslated into another place fourthly by remembring that christ our head beeing now in heauen and we his members vpon the earth during our life we are in presence separated from our head and consequently from that happie and glorious fellowship which we shall inioy with him and all the saints our fellow members in the kingdome of heauen this s paul noteth when he saith whilst we are at home in the bodie we are absent from the lord and thereupon himselfe desired to be dissolued and to be with christ hauing thus entred into the due consideration of the aforesaid euills we must in the second place exercise our selues in the frequent meditation of the blessed estate of god chosen in the kingdome of glorie who beeing translated out of this life into the bosome of abraham are fully and perfectly freed from sinne from satan from vanitie and mis ie haue all teares wiped from their eyes doe behold the face of god are made like vnto christ in holines and honour and doe with him inhe it the kingdome prepared for them from the foudations of the world in the third place hauing throughly considered of these things we must compare the estate of this present life in the respects before named with the estate of that which is to come in the kingdome of heauen and laying them in a paralell together we shall find the one infinitely farre to excell the other in regard of true ioy and comfort and this will make vs though liuing in the world yet to vse it as if we vsed it not to haue our conuersation in heauen to thinke with paul that to be loosed and be with christ is best of all for vs to haue a t ue amp liuely tast of the ioyes of the world to come and accordingly with abraham isaac and iacob to looke for a citie that hath foundations whose builder and maker is god secondly it is demanded how a man may truly discerne whether this ioy of the spirit be in him yes or no for answer hereunto it is to be remembred that there are sundrie properties whereby it differeth from carnall ioy and these are principally fiue first this ioy is brought forth as it were of sorrow for sinne and for the want of christ ye shall sorrow saith our sauiour christ to his disciples meaning for his departure but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy these words are not onely meant of his disciples but of all beleeuers who vpon consideration of their sinnes and the spirituall want of christ iesus doe mourne and lament for not only they but all true beleeuers are there opposed vnto the world againe blessed are they that mourne that is beeing touched with causes of exceeding griefe doe withall mourne for their sinnes for they shall be comforted on the other side carnall ioy as it hath his beginning from the flesh and ariseth of things pleasing thereunto so it ends in sorrow amp heauines in the end reioycing is turned into mourning saith salomon and woe be to you that now laugh for ye shall weepe secondly the ioy of the spirit is a fruit of righteousnes that is it issueth and floweth from christ knowne and beleeued to be made vnto vs of god wisdome righteousnes sanctification and full redemption for from hence follows peace of conscience and from peace comes ioy in the holy ghost contrariwise the ioy of the flesh ariseth onely from the sudden feeling of some worldly delight and therefore cannot bring any sound peace vnto the conscience o the man possessed of it thirdly spirituall ioy is founded in the holy vse of the word sacraments amp praier and in the practise of christian duties of mercie loue iustice ampc the other is not so for the world conceiueth a ioy besides the word out of the exercises of inuocation and repentance which stands in the practise of crueltie malice oppression iniustice and all manner of impietie and hence it is that hauing spent their daies in such matter of reioycing at length in a moment they goe downe to hell fourthly heauenly ioy is so fixed and rooted in the heart that it cannot be remooued thence your ioy shall no man take from you saith christ it must needes therefore be true and sound yes able to swallow vp all matter of griefe and heauinesse whereas the other is neuer sincere but with the sweetnes thereof hath alwaies mingled some bitternes euen in laughter saitl s lomon speaking thereof the heart is heauie when the face of the wicked man shineth and his countenance is pleasant euen then is he inwardly sorrowfull and his minde is troubled lastly the ioy of the spirit is eternall abiding in the mind of man not onely for the terme of this life but for euer in the world to come so is not the reioycing of the world in earthly things for it is fading and deceitfull as the things themselues be wherein it is placed it hath the beginning in corruption and endeth with this present life the examples of the two rich man in the gospel doe manifest this truth and to this purpose is the speech of zophar in the booke of iob that the reioycing of the vicked is very short and the ioy of hypoer es is but a moment ampc by these fiue properties may we put a true difference betweene earthly and heauenly reioycing and consequently discerne of them euen in our selues and if we perceiue this ioy of the spirit rightly receiued in our hearts and grounded in the right vse of the word and sacraments as also in the exercises of inuocation faith and repentance to take place in our soules and consciences we shall finde it of force to moderate and delay the very terrours of death and so much for preparation now the helpes to be vsed in the time of death are manifold the summe of all may be reduced to two heads meditations and practises touching meditations we must in the first place consider death in a double respect one as it is in it owne nature and another as it is changed and qualified by the death of christ death in it owne nature is a curse or forerunner of condemnation the very gates and suburbs of hell it selfe but beeing qualified by christ it is a blessing a short passage vnto ioy an entrance into euerlasting life a quiet sleepe voide of all annoyance by dreames and fantasies and the graue a resting chamber persumed by the death of christ for the body of all the elect our of which when they awake they shall be admitted and receiued into the presence of god in heauen secondly we are to consider that there be three degrees of eternall life the first where of is in this world before we die and it is then when we beginne to repent and beleeue in christ and to be assured in conscience that god the father is our father christ our redeemer and the holy ghost our comforter for this is eternall life to know god and him whome he hath sent iesus christ the next degree is in death for death cuts off all sinne originall and actuall death frees vs from all worldly miseries death prepareth the bodie that it may be fit to enter into eternall happinesse together with the soule which is alreadie in heauen the last degree is when bodie and soule reunited goe both together into eternall and euerla ing glorie in heauen our third meditation is that there is a mysticall vnion and coniunction betweene christ amp euery beleeuer and that not onley in regard of soule but of bodie also which beeing once knit shall neuer be dissolued but is eternall wherevpon the dying dead rotten and consumed bodie remaineth still a member of christ abideth within the couenant and is and shall be euer a temple of the holy ghost thus adam and abraham which are dead so many thousand yeares agoe yes euery true beleeuer from them to the end of the world shall rise at the last day in body to glorie by the power of their coniunction with christ in the winter season we see the most trees voide of leaues buddes and blossomes so as they seeme to vs to be dead and yet neuerthelesse there is a sappe in the roote of them which in the spring wil ascend amp reuiue the decaied branches euen so it is with our body which though they be corrupted rotten burnt or eaten with wormes or deuoured by wild beast so as they may seeme to be vtterly perished yet there is as it were a secret and hidden sap in them by reason of their vnion with christ by which they shall be raised reuiued amp quickened beeing made like vnto the glorious bodie of christ their head with whome they shall raigne and liue for euermore helpes in practise are two first he that will beare with comfort the pangs of death must labour that he may die in christ and that is by faith laying hold of the promise of god touching forgiuenesse of sinnes and life euerlasting by christ all these saith the holy ghost died in faith namely abel enoch noe abraham and sarah all laying hold of the promise of life by christ when iacob on his death bed was blessing of his children he brake forth into this heauenly speach o lord i haue waited for thy saluation in which words it is plaine that his faith rested on the mercy of god amp by hope he waited for his saluatio and our sauiour christ saith as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lift vp that whosoeuer beleeueth in him might not perish but haue life euerlasting out of which words the forenamed dutie may be learned that looke as the children of israel beeing stung with fierie serpents and that vnto death were healed by looking vp to the brasen serpent erected by moses so when we are stung with sinne and death we must euer remember by faith to looke vpon christ but specially when we are dying then it is our part to fixe the eies of our soules by faith vpon him and thereby shall we escape death and be made partakers of eternall life and happinesse notable is the example of christ who as he was man alwaies fixed his trust and confidence in his fathers word especially at his end for when he was dying and the pangs of death seazed vpon him he cries vnto the lord my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and againe father into thy hands i commend my spirit which words are ful of faith and doe bewray what great affiance he placed in his fathers loue ampc when dauid in an extremitie saw nothing before his eies but present death the people intending to stone him at the very instant as the text saith he comforted himselfe in the lord his god but how by calling to minde the mercifull promises that god had made vnto him and by applying them vnto his heart by faith and paul saith of himselfe and the rest of the faithfull that they receiued the sentence of death in themselues that they might not trust in themselues but in god from these examples it followes that they which desire with comfort to beare the pangs of death must die by faith that is they must set before their eies the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting and depend vpon it wrapping as it were and infolding themselues in it as in a close and warme garment that will keepe them safe and sure against the winde and weather of temptation the second practise in time of death is to die in obedience which is nothing else but willingly readily and ioyfully without murmuring to submit ourselues to god will in bearing the paines of death a most worthie president of this obedience we haue in our sauiour christ when he said vnto his father not my will but thy will be done thereby submitting his will to his fathers will touching the death which he then suffered and this his example at the time of his departure must be a rule of direction vnto vs vpon the like occasion true it is that obedience to god in death is against corrupt nature and therefore our dutie is the more to invre our selues to the performing of it and that which the blessed apostle said of himselfe i die daily ought to be continually our resolution and practise if we shall inquire howe this may be done the answer is when god layeth afflictions vpon vs in our life time then by indeauouring to beare them with patience meeknes and lowlinesse for euery affliction is as it were a petty death and if we doe in it subiect our selues to the hand of god we shal the better obey him in the great death of all and thus doing whensoeuer god striketh vs with death we shall with comfort endure the same the third particular affliction is satanicall molestation whereby both persons amp places of mansio or abode are either possessed or otherwise molested by the malice of the deuill touching this affliction the question of coscience is how such persons as are possessed or feare possession or else indure molestations by the deuill in their houses may haue their minds quieted and staied and consequently in that case be remedied and here things are generally to be considered in way of answer first it is to be remembred that possession is known by two signes the one is when the deuill is euidetly present either in the whole body or in soe part of it the other when he hath rule of the said bodie either in whole or in part so as the party himselfe hath not that vse of his body which he would as for example when the devil possesseth the instruments of the voice as the tongue amp makes a ma to speake latine greeke italian or other tongues which he vnderstandeth not both these things were found in them that were possessed in the time of our sauiour christ secondly we must consider it falleth out oftentimes that strange diseases doe seaze vpon man hauing strage effects in the which the arte of physicke neither can search out nor cure amp yet they are neither acts of witchcraft nor reall possessios as when god laid extraordinarie diseases on the corinthians for the contempt of his word and sacraments corinthian like vnto which he vvorthily inflicts vpon man in these daies for the same and other sinnes now to stay the minde in this case these rules are carefully to be thought vpon first of all it is to be remembred that though satans malice and power be very great and large yet he canot practise the same against the children of god when where and howe he listeth the malice which satan beares to mankind and principally to the members of christ appeares in this because he is said to accuse them before god day and night reu and as a roaring lyon to walke about the world seeking whome he may deuoure pet againe the scripture noteth him to be a powerfull spirit whose strength farre exceedeth and surpasseth the might of any man or creature that is not of an angelical nature as himselfe is for he is tearmed a prince of the aire and the god of this world his power reacheth euen to the spirits amp soules of man whereby he worketh in the children of disobedience ephesians his principallitie is so great that no strength no defence of man is able to withstand it vnlesse man take vnto himselfe the whole armour of god ephesians now although the deuill be so malitious an enemie of mankind that he ceaseth not to deuise whatsoeuer may be hurtfull vnto them and withall so powerfull in his attempts that no man by his owne proper strength is able to resist him yet he cannot put the least part of his power in execution in what time place or manner he desireth the reason is because god hath determined his power by certaine bounds and limits which he cannot passe and they are especially two the one is his owne nature whereby he is a creature and therefore finite hence it is that he can neither knowe nor doe any thing that is beyond the reach or capacitie of his nature or aboue the power and skill of a creature for example he cannot directly and immediately knowe the deepe things of god vnlesse they be reuealed vnto him nor yet the secrets of mans heart none knoweth the things of a man saue the spirit of man which is in him euen so the things of god knoweth none but the spirit of god corinthian again he cannot doe that which is truely and properly a miracle the cause wherof is hidden and vtterly vnknowne and which comes not within the power and order of nature for this is proper vnto god who onely doth things simply wonderfull psalm the second thing whereby satans power is restrained is the will of god for looke as the sea beeing by nature apt to ouerflowe the whole earth is kept in and shut vp within the shore as it were with dores or gates that it cannot break forth and that by the lord himselfe who hath established his decree vpon it iob so though satan be by nature strong and his malice great yet can he doe nothing at all no nor execute his naturall power to the hurt and preiudice of any man without the will and permission of god thus the euill spirit could not goe forth to deceiue ahab vntill the lord had said vnto him goe and thou shalt pre aile king thus the deuill could not touch the bodie children goods or friendes of righteous iob whilest he was fenced and fortified by the power and prouidence of god but when the lord in regard of iobs outward estate had giuen him leaue amp said loe all that he hath is in thine hand then did he exercise his power to the vtmost yet so farre onely as he was permitted and no further iob the consideration of this first point that satans power is determined by god will serue to stay the minds of those whose persons houses or friends are molested by him for hereupon it followeth that god who hath the deuill bound vp as it were in chaines will not suffer his power to be inlarged against his owne children to their destruction and confusion but so far forth alone as shall be expedient for their good and saluation againe that god beeing their father in christ iesus they may in the case of such affliction haue accesse vnto him amp call vpon him for the restraint of satans power and malice and consequently for the deliuerance of them and theirs a second rule is this such persons must haue recourse to god in his word in which he promiseth his presence and protection to his children in their greatest dangers and namely that there shall no euill come vnto them neither any plague shall come neere their dwelling because he will giue his angels charge ouer them to keepe them in all their waies againe that he wil be a wall of fire round about his people zach that he will extend peace ouer his church like a stood isa and that there shall be no sorcerie in iacob nor south saying in israel numb and by this meanes possessions and witchcraft though they befall god children yet they shall turne to their good rather then their hurt thirdly it must be considered that the best servant of god haue beene in their times molested by the deuill christ in his second temptation was carried by the deuill from the wildernes to a wing of the temple of ierusalem the children of iob were destroied by the deuill and he himselfe was filled with botches and sores a certaine woman euen a daughter of abraham that is one following the faith of abraham was troubled with a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeares together matth and the daughter of the woman of canaan was grieuously vexed with a deuill fourthly man in this case ought to lay fast hold vpon the promise of life euerlasting and must wait the lord leisure not limiting him in respect of time or meanes of deliuerance this was the practise of iob though he kill me yet will i trust in him and of holy abraham who did not limit god but was content to doe with isaac what the lord would and though it was in likelyhood a meane to bereaue him of all posteritie yet still he kept himselfe to the promise in the molestation and annoiance of houses by spirits two things are to be remembred first man must not consort together and abide there where it is certenly knowne that the lord hath giuen the deuill power and libertie least in so doing they tempt the lord our sauiour christ did not of his owne priuate motion and will betake himselfe into the wildernes but by the direction of the holy ghost math paul in like manner did not of his owne head goe to ierusalem but vpon the motion of the spirit act in the light of these examples man are taught not to cast themselues into any places of apparent danger much lesse to frequet those which god hath deliuered vp into the power of satan and this condemneth the rash and headie conceits of some persons who vpon confidence of their owne strength doe put the selues into needlesse dangers hauing neither extraordinarie calling from god nor any sufficient warrant out of his word if it be asked what me are to doe in this case i answer first that they ought rather to flie to god by praier and to draw neere vnto him in their hearts and he in mercle will draw neere vnto them secondarily that which we doe in meates and drinkes is also to be done in the houses and places where we dwell and what is that we must sanctifie them to our vse by the word and praier noah at god commandement went into the arke abode in it and came out againe and when he came forth of it into the earth afterward it is said of him that he built an altar gaue thankes to god for his deliuerance and praied the lord to vouchsafe him the vse of the earth as he had before though abraham had a promise of the land of canaan to him and his posteritie for euer yet he went not out of his countrey toward it till the lord commanded him and when he was come thither he built an altar for the worship and seruice of god the like he did afterward at bethel and many yeres after did iacob offer sacrifice vnto god in the same bethel when he came to dwell there and for this very ende in the law by a speciall ordinance the first frutes of the haruest were offered to sanctifie the rest of the corne and somuch touching the second distresse the third kind of trouble of mind is that which ariseth of the tentation of blasphemie which in regard of the vilenes and vglinesse thereof is not amisse tearmed by some the foule tentation and it is when a man is troubled in his minde with blasphemous cogitations and thoughts directly against the maiestie of god the father the son and the holy ghost as for example to thinke that god is not iust mercifull that he accepteth mens persons that he hath not knowledge of things that are done here below or at least that he doth not regard them that god cannot doe this or that that he is iniurious to some man and partiall to others ampc these and such like blasphemous thoughts there be which are not fit to be vttered amogst man forasmuch as they are most horrible and execrable as any can be conceiued that we may the better know this temptation let it be considered what are the forerunners thereof and by what meanes it takes place in the heart possessed of it sometimes it commeth meerely and onely of the suggestion of the deuill which troubleth the phantasie euen of those which are in that regard innocent and casteth into their hearts impure and vngodly thoughts sometimes againe it comes vpon man by an euill custome when as they willingly lend their eares to leude and cursed speeches that immediatly tend to the dishonour of god or the wilfull abuse of his word his iudgements and mercies and vpon the hearing either giue their applause and approbation though not expressely or doe not hinder or stay them as much as in them lieth otherwhiles it creepes into the heart of man by degrees when he beginnes to waxe cold in god seruice to make little conscience of those duties that immediatly concerne his worship amp consequently inures himselfe to the taking of the name of god in vaine by often and eauselesse swearing for swearing cursing ampc by these and such like meanes is this foule and horrible tentation conuaied into the minde of man now the danger of it whether it ariseth fro these or any other causes is exceeding grieuous specially to those that haue begun to chuse the way of truth and to applie their hearts to serue god and to feare his name for it bringeth forth strange and fearefull effects as namely desperation amp manifold horrors amp troubles of mind yes diverse persons haue hereupon bin astonished in such sort that they haue bin mooued to make dispatch of theselues being in their own iudgement no better then the very firebrands of hell now for the curing of this woderfull trouble amp distraction of conscience two things are to be done to wit inquirie must be made into the next causes whence this tentation should arise and after that the remedie is to be applied for the first inquitie must be made whether the present distresse had his beginning from the thoughts of a mans owne minde or from the suggestion of the deuill for this is in all likelyhood the next way to minister comfort to the afflicted partie it may be saide how shall a man discerne the thoughts that are from the deuill from his owne thoughts ans he shall know them by sundrie notes first by the entrance of them into the mind for those that come from the deuill come speedily as lightning into a house and they are after a sort forced into the minde by violence so as the partie cannot auoid them and they come into the minde againe and againe yes a thousand times in a day so as by their often comming they weaken the memorie dull the senses wearie and confound the braine these are thoughts that come from the deuill and by him are conuaied from without into the minde of man and if such cogitations were from a mans owne selfe they would not come with so great vehemencie and celeritie but with leisure and they would rise with more moderation and lesse violence yes further the frequent vse of them would not produce so many and so fearefull effects as it doth secondly such thoughts may be discerned to come from the devil by this signe because they are against the very light of nature against naturall knowledge reason amp coscience for they are most wicked and deuillish fastning vpon god things that are most vile and monstrous whereas commonly the thoughts that arise fro our owne corrupt nature are not against the light of nature though they be most corrupt the third signe is that at the first conceiuing of them the partie is smitten with an extraordinarie feare his flesh is troubled and oftentimes sicknes amp faintings do follow but the thoughts that man conceiue of themselues cause neither feare nor fainting nor sicknes fourthly blasphemous thoughts cannot come ordinarily from the heart of any saue of those alone that are of reprobate minds but the parties that are thus distressed are honest ciuill and such as professe the gospel at least in shew yes sometime they befall such as are the true mebers of christ therfore it is manifest that they come from without euen from the deuill casting them into the minde and not from within a mans owne selfe in the next place inquirie must be made whether the partie doth approoue loue amp like these and such like thoughts or no to this he will answer if he be asked that he abhorres the as the deuill and hell it selfe thus euen naturall man will answer and that truly after inquirie thus made the remedie is to be applied and the first and principall remedic pertaines to doctrine and instruction in which the partie is to be informed of his or her estate namely that the foresaid blasphemies are not his sinnes but his crosses for they are the deuills sinnes and he shal answer for them and they are not ours till we intertaine receiue approoue and giue consent vnto them for proofe hereof let this be considered that vncleane thoughts which haue their residence in the minde of man are of two sorts inward and outward inward are such as haue their originall from the flesh and arise of the corruption of mans nature though stirred vp by the deuill and these at the very first conceiuing are our sinnes though they haue no long abode in our mindes and they are directly forbidden in the tenth commandement outward thoughts are those which haue relation to an outward cause or beginning of which sort are those euill thoughts that be conucied into the minde by the deuill and if we take no pleasure in them nor yeeld consent vnto the they are not to be accounted our sinnes but the devil by whome they are suggested the truth hereof appeares in christs example into whose minde the devil cast this blasphemous tentation therby moouing him to infidelitie couetousnes amp idolatry which neuerthelesse were not his sins because his holy heart gaue not the least approbation to the but abhorred amp repelled the amp therfore was free fro any taint of sin in or by them this distinction of thoughts must be remembred for hence it followes that blasphemous thoughts not consented to by vs are not our sinnes but the devil euen as in like case when one wickedly disposed sollicites another to treason or murder if the said partie listen not nor yeild thereto he cannot be holden guiltie of those crimes therefore man must not feare those kind of thoghts ouermuch at least if they please not themselues ouermuch in them because though they be indeede their crosses yet are they not their personall sinnes for which they shall incurre the wrath and displeasure of god againe they must let them goe as they come they are not to striue against them for the more they labour to resist them the more shall they be intangled with them the second thing to be vsed in way of remedie for the staying of the mind in this tentation is that though it should be graunted that the foresaid euill and blasphemous thoughts are our sinnes yet we are to remember that they may through the mercie and goodnesse of god be pardoned if they be heartily and vnfainedly repented of yes further that neither they nor any other sins except that against the holy ghost doe condemne him that praieth against them and is heartily sorrie for them it was pauls complaint rom that he did not the good which he would doe speaking of the inward indeauour of his heart and againe that he did the euill which he would not meaning in respect of the corruption of his nature now vpon this that he indeauoured to doe that which was agreeable to the will of god that he loathed and detested the contrarie amp stroue against his corruptions how did he comfort himselfe marke words following v if i do that i would not that is to say if against my generall purpose i sinne against god if i be sorrie for it if i be displeased with my selfe in that i cannot obey god in that perfection i desire it is no more i that doe it but sinne that dwelleth in me from this example of paul i gather that if any man haue in his minde euill thoughts and doeth as paul did grieue because he thereby offendeth god if he doe abhorre them and pray against them he shall not be condemned for them they shall neuer be laid to his charge the partie then that is troubled with these thoughts may vpon these grounds stay his minde and comfort himselfe for if he shall not be condemned for them then let him not feare them aboue measure the third point to be remembred is that the partie must not be alone for this tentation beginnes and is confirmed by solitarinesse and the parties thus distressed loue to be apart by themselues from the societie of others and for that cause in case they be lyable to this distresse they must vse to solace themselues in good company that is meere and fit for them and their mindes are to be exercised in holy meditation of the word and singing of psalmes and they are to be occupied in good speech and conference our first parent eue was tempted by sathan when shee was apart from adam and our sauiout christ when he was alone out of company and societie then was he by the malice of the deuill in the wildernesse assaulted with strong and mightie tentations the fourth point to be remembred of the partie troubled is that he must as heartely and earnestly repent him of those his euill thoughts as of euill wordes and deedes for the trueth is because man haue no more care of their thoughts then commonly they haue therefore the lord iustly suffers the deuill to plague them and torment them by conuaying into their hearts most vile and damnable cogitations furthermore the said partie must labour to be renued in the spirit of his minde that is to haue his minde inlightened by the spirit whereby he may know and vnderstand the will of god in his word after repentance for euill thoughts there must follow watchfulnesse and a carefull circumspection ouer all his waies but principally he must haue an eie vnto his heart the fountaine of all keepe thine heart with all diligence saith salomon that is aboue all things see that thou countergard thy thoughts desires motios and affections that the heart of a man may be garded two rules are to be obserued first that the word of god dwell plentifully in it for by this meanes it is guided and directed that it swarue not from god and his word and our hearts are then ruled and gouerned by the word when we know amp meditate vpon the commandements and promises of god this rule is of speciall vse for therfore doe man hatch amp breed euill thoughts in their hearts because they are not take vp with holy meditations amp hence it is that the heart of man is made euen a pray vnto the deuill because the word of god is not lodged therein excellet was the practise of dauid in this case who kept the word of god in his heart that he mighe not sinne against him the second rule of the keeping of the heart is to establish our thoughts by counsell it is the wisemans aduise in so many words prou wherin he would teach vs that it is the property of a worldly wise man in matters of waight not to trust to his own wit but to follow the direction and counsel of wise and skilful man and if this be a sound course in matters of the world much more ought it to be taken in the maine matters of religion and conscience concerning the heart and soule of man and therfore by the law of proportio it giues vs direction not once to thinke or conceiue so much as a thought but vpon aduice and direction taken at god and his word thy testimonies saith dauid are my delight and my counsellers and what benefit had he by taking such a course surely by the word of god which was his continuall meditation he gat vnderstading he became wiser the the ancient it made him to hate al the waies of falshood it kept him from declining from god either to the right hand or to the left the same rule must be practized of vs in the vse of our senses our speeches and actions and then shall the heart be kept cleane and free from these temptations and seeing this temptation is so dangerous amp fearefull as hath beene said and doeth ost befall man our dutie is to make conscience of practising the foresaid rules continually and thus much concerning the third kinde of distresse of conscience the fourth distresse of mind is that which ariseth from a mans owne sinnes or rather from some one special sinne committed and this kind of tentation is twofold for either it is more violent and lesse common or lesse violent and more common the violent distresse of minde shewes it selfe by feares and terror of the conscience by doubtings of the mercie of god by lamentable and fearefull complaint made to others nowe question is mooued howe this violent distresse of minde arising from our owne sinnes is to be cured answer that it may be cured by the blessing of god three things must be done first that particular sinne must be knowne which is the cause of this violent distresse and here we are to know by the way that it is an vsuall thing with the parties thus distressed to dissemble and cloake their sinnes and therefore they will alleadge that their trouble ariseth fro some euill thoughts from wicked affections and from the corruption of nature whereas commonly man are not distressed in violent manner for euill thoughts affections ampc but the violent distresse commeth from some actuall and odious sinne or sins done which wound the conscience and are the causes of great distraction of minde and they are many which hauing bin vpon occasion before rehearsed i will not now repeat them onely this must be remembred that the greater sinnes against the third sixt and seauenth commandements are the maine and proper causes of violent distresses and the more secret these sinnes are the more horrour goeth with them secondly the particular sinne being known inquiry must be made as much as possibly may be by signes whether the partie distressed repenteth yes or no for except he hath repented he cannot be fitted to receiue comfort and vnlesse he be first fitted to receiue comfort he cannot be releiued in conscience now if it be found that the partie hath repented then care must be had in the next place that his repentance may be renued for the particular sinne committed thirdly hauing thus done the comfort must be ministred for the moderating or taking away of the distresse and here remember by the way that the comforts ministred vsually amp ordinarily must not go alone but be mingled amp tepered with some terror of the law that being thereby feared with the consideration of sinne and of the wrath of god due vnto the same the comfort may appeare to be the sweeter the ministring whereof in case of this distresse would not be direct and present but by certaine steppes and degrees except onely in the point of death for then a directer course must be vsed these degrees are two first the partie is to be informed of a possibilitie of pardon that is that his sinnes are pardonable and though in themselues they be great and hainous yet by the mercie of god in christ they may be remitted nowe put the case that the afflicted apprenhendeth onely the odiousnesse of his sinnes and the wrath of god due to the same and in this fit puts off the pardon from himselfe and cannot be perswaded that his sinne may be forgiuen what then is to be done ans then for the effecting of this first degree certaine grounds are to be laid downe whereupon assurance in that case may be built vp in his heart the first groud of possibilitie of pardo is that the mercy of god is infinite yes ouer al his works psalm that the death of christis of infinite price merit and value before god that god is muchin sparing isa that with the lord is mercie and with him is plenteous redemption psalm that christs satisfaction is not only a price but a couterprice tim able to satisfie for the sinnes of all man yes for them that haue sinned against the holy ghost for that sinne is not therefore vnpardonable because the offence thereof is greater then the merit of christ but because the partie offending neither doth nor can apply the merit of christ vnto himselfe an ancient father vpon cains words my punishment is greater then i can beare saith thou liest cain for god mercie is greater then thy sinnes the mercie of god was very great to manasses and to salomon and to many others though they were great offenders the second ground man of yeares liuing in the church of god and knowing the doctrine of saluation shall not be condemned simply for their sinnes but for lying in their sinnes vpon this ground i say that man distressed must be grieued not so much for committing of sinne as for lying and continuing in sinnes committed a third ground it pleaseth god many times to leaue man to themselues and to suffer them to commit some sinne that woundeth consceence it is true and cannot be denied but we must withall remember that sinnes committed doe not vtterly take away grace but rather make it the more to shine and shew it selfe for god in mercie turneth all things euen sinne it selfe to the good of them that be his and therfore sinne committed cannot either waste or extinguish grace receiued but by diuihe dispensation serueth to amplifie and inlarge the same so as where sinne aboundeth there grace aboundeth much more rom and the lord said to paul beeing in great extremity corinthian my grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect through weakenes hence it appeareth that the grace of god is not vtterly lost but appeareth liuely in the time of distresse the fourth ground is this the promises of god touching remission of sinnes and l fe eternall in respect of beleeuers are generall and in regard of all and euery man indefinite that is they doe not define or exclude any person or any sinner or any time onely they admit one exception of finall impenitencie here a question may be mooued howe long he that ministreth comfort must stand vpon the possibilitie of pardon i answer vntill he hath brought the partie distressed to some measure of true repentance and this beeing done then he is to proceede to the second degree of comfort the second degree of comfort is to teach that the sinne or sinnes of the partie distressed are indeede pardoned but it may be asked vpon what signes may this comfort be applyed i answere vpon these two first if the partie distressed confesse that he or shee is heartily grieued that by their sinne or sinns they haue offended so louing and so mercifull a god secondly if they professe that they desire with all their heart to be reconciled vnto god in christ and at least doe desire to repent for their sinnes and withall doe carrie in heart a purpose to sinne no more but in all things as much as in them lieth to performe newe obedience vnto god nowe for the better enforcing of this comfort some textes of scripture fitting this purpose must be rehearsed as for example matth i came not to call the righteous that is to say those that iudge themselues righteous but sinners that is those which are grieued because in their owne conscience they are vile and hainous offenders to repentance againe matth come vnto me allye that are wearie and eauie laden and i will refresh you to conclude this point there remaines yet a further question to be resolued and that is this a man after repentance for some grieuous sinne falls into it againe and is distressed more then before it is a case somewhat grieuous for we knowe that if a man be recouered of an ague and through distemper in diet or otherwise makes a relapse in o it againe his case is often desperate and he hardly scapeth with his life in the same manner it is a dangerous case if after repentance man make a relapse into the same sin againe it may then be asked how such persons may be recouered after a relapse i answer though we finde not any one particular example in scripture of any one person that was restored againe after a relapse yet neuerthelesse there is some comfort for such persons vpon what grounds may some say ans man that haue not so much as a drop of mercy in coparison of god must forgiue their brethre often amp many times yes as our sauiour christ saith to peter till seuenty times seauen times if they returne amp say it repents them now god is infinite in all his attributes he is much in sparing with him is plenteous redemption and therefore he will questionlesse vpon true repentance often forgiue amp forget euen the same sinne iterated againe and againe nowe these persons are to be releiued in this sort first they must haue their consciences setled in this point that their relapse is pardonable though very dangerous for proofe hereof read esay where mention is made of diverse apostataes that were by god called to repentance with promise of pardo if they turned vnto him and in luke the prodigall child by whome i vnderstand one that after grace receiued ell from his repentance and obedience to god when he did but purpose in his heart to returne againe was pardoned and receiued into fauour in the corinthian paul saith to the corinths that were fallen away we pray you in christs steade that ye be reconciled vnto god secondly beeing thus setled in coscience they must againe repent them of their sinnes thirdly and lastly they are to be comforted with the promise of remission of sinnes after that some signes of renewed repentance for sins past haue beene giuen the second tentation or trouble of minde which is more common and lesse violent befalls the children of god and it is a griefe of heart more or lesse wherby man are troubled in respect of the want of grace in their hearts and defects of obediece in their liues paul the deere servant of god was possessed with this trouble of minde as we may read rom and indeede there is no childe of god but more or lesse one time or other he feeles the stings of sinne amp the buffe ings of satan which cause griefe in his heart but this griefe is a notable grace of god and therefore they which want it must labour to haue it and they which haue it must not seek to put it out but to keep it in measure amp order and the grounds of comfort whereby the heart may be staied in this sorrow that it be not immoderate may be these i ground it is god will that the worke of sanctification or regeneration should be imperfect in this life and remaine vnfinished til death this point needs no proofe for it is manifest both in the word of god and in daily experience the reasons for which god will haue it to be so may be these first of all god giues grace according to the measure and manner of our receiuing of it which in this life is imperfect some giftes of god in christ bestowed on his servant as remission of sinnes by his death and iustification by his obedience are not put into vs but are only applyed and made ours by imputation some other giftes there be which are infused and put into vs as namely sanctification regeneration the loue of god and man and by one of these two meanes to wit either by imputation or infusion are all the giftes of god in christ made ours yet before we can haue them we must receiue them and the meanes whereby we receiue them is faith which god hath ordained to be the hand of our soules to receiue his benefits bestowed on vs which faith because it is weake and imperfect in this life therefore the gifts which we receiue thereby are also imperfect for though god benefits be like a bottomlesse sea yet the faith whereby we lay hold of them is like vnto a vessell with a narrowe necke which though it be cast into the great ocean receiues but a litle water at once amp that by degrees drop by droppe according to the widenesse of the mouth and hence it is that though the giftes of god without vs which are ours by imputation be perfect yet all such graces as are put into vs are weake and imperfect secondly if any servant of god should be perfectly regenerate and made absolutely holy in this life then he should fulfill the morall lawe and so become a sauiour to himselfe and by the tenour of the law haue life amp so should not christ be a sauiour properly but only an instrumet to dispose vs to the keeping of the law whereby we might saue our selues but there is one only al sufficiet sauiour christ iesus amp the beginning the middle amp the accoplishment of our saluation is to be ascribed to him alone thirdly it is the will of god that his owne children with whome he is well pleased in christ should bee brought to nothing in themselues that they might be all in all out of themselues in christ beeing as it were emptied of selfe loue and of all confidence in their owne goodnesse but if sanctification should be perfect at the first then a man should not goe out of himselfe but would rather stay as he is and rest contented in his own goodnesse for this cause paul after his exaltation was buffered by satans temptations that he might not be exalted out of measure corinthian but should content himselfe with this that he was in the loue and fauour of god in christ ii ground is to consider what makes a man professing christ accepted of god and howe much he himselfe must doe for this ende the substance of all things to be done of vs for this ende that we may become the children of god may be reduced to three heads first of all we must heartily bewaile our sinnefull liues past and seriously humble our selues in regard of our owne sins both of heart and life and if by occasion wee fall into any sinne we must not lie therein but by speedie repentance recouer our former estate secondly in regard of the sinnefulnesse of our hearts and liues in times past we must rest our selues on god mercie alone flying to the throne of mercie for the pardon of them all thirdly we must indeauour in the course of our liues afterward to performe obedience to god in all his commandements that thereby we may shew our selues thankefull to him for his mercie consider the examples of this practise in god children all that dauid that worthy servant of god could doe after his sinnes committed to bring himselfe againe into the fauour of god whome he had offended consisted of these very heads which haue beene named repentance confidence and affiance in god mercie and performance of new obedience and this his practise was verified amongst many other places specially in the psalme and in all the psalmes commonly called penitentiall againe the prophet daniel was accepted of god onely for the doing of these things daniel and in like manner was paul and the rest of the apostles yet here remaines a great difficultie many a good servant of god may and doth truly say of himselfe i bewaile my sinnes and doe in some sort rest on god mercie and withall i endeauour to performe new obedience but alas here is my griefe i cannot doe these things as i would in matter of sorrow and griefe i am troubled with hardnes of heart in occasions of boldnes and confidence with doubting in indeauour to obey with many sinnes and sundrie faults for the staying and moderating of this griefe these rules may further be remembred the first rule if there be in the minde a purpose not to sinne in the wil a desire to please god and in the whole man an indeauour to performe the purpose of the minde and the desire of the will marke what follows vpon this god in mercie accepteth the purpose and will to obey for obedience it selfe yes though a man faile in the very act and doe not so well as he should this is a great mercie of god and we can neuer be sufficiently thankfull for the same but yet that we may not here delude our hearts with conceits and blesse our selues in vaine we must know that god doth not alwaies accept the will for the deede vnlesse there be a constant purpose in heart a true desire in will and some resolued endeauour sutable in the life malach goa spares them that feare him as a father spares his owne child how is that though the childe beeing commanded some busines goeth about it very vnhandsomly and so the deede be done to small purpose yet the father accepts it as well done if he see the childe yeelde vnto his commandement and doe his indeauour to the vttermost of his power euen so will god deale with those that be his children but how will some say can god accept a worke of ours that is imperfect ans so farre forth as the obedience is done in truth so farre forth god accepts it because it is his own work in vs and as it is ours he pardons it vnto vs because we are in christ a second rule is laide downe rom where paul saith to this purpose the good which i would doe i doe not and the euill which i would not that doe i in these words is set downe the state of all regenerate man in this life and the meaning is this the good things which god hath commaunded i doe them but not as i would and the euill forbidden i auoid but not as i would this we shall see to be true by comparing the voyces of three kindes of man together the carnall man saith i do not that which is good neither will i do it and that which is euill i do and i will do it contrariwise the man glorified he saith that which is good i do and will do it and that which is euill i do not neither will i do it the regenerate man in a midle betweene them both he saith the good things commanded i do but not as i would the euill things forbidden i auoid but not as i would and this is the estate of the child of god in this life who in this regard is like vnto a diseased man who loues his health and therefore obserues both diet and physicke and yet he often falls into his fit againe though he be neuer so carefull to obserue the rules of the physitian by reason of the distemperature of his bodie and hereupon is faine to goe to the physitian the second time for new counsell in like manner god children haue indeede in their hearts a care to please and obey god but by reason of sinne that dwelleth in them they faile often and so are faine to humble themselues againe before him by new repentance againe the servant of god are like to a man by some suddaine accident cast into the sea who in striuing to saue himselfe from drowning puts to all his stregth to swimme to the shore and being come almost vnto it there meetes him a waue or billow which driues him cleane backe againe it may be a mile or further and then the former hope and ioy conceiued of escape is sore abated yet he returnes againe and still labours to come to the land and neuer rests till he attaine vnto it iii ground he that is indeede regenerate hath this priuiledge that the corruption of nature is no part of him neither doth it belong to his person in respect of diuine imputation paul saith of himselfe rom it is no more i but sin that dwelleth in me in which words he distinguisheth betweene his owne person and sinne that is in him for in man regenerate there be three things the bodie the soule amp the gift of god image restored againe now touching the corruption of nature that is in his person and so may be said to be his but it belongs not to the man regenerate it is not his because it is not imputed to him and so indeede is as though it were not in him the apostle thes praies for the thessalonians that god would sanctifie them throughout and preserue their whole spirit soule and bodie of which place amongst many this exposition may be giuen the apostle speaking of man regenerate and sanctified makes three parts in them bodie soule and spirit and by spirit we are to vnderstand not the conscience but the gift of regeneration and sanctification which is in the whole man bodie amp soule opposed to the flesh which in a naturall man is that which is called the old man rom and the praier which paul makes in the behalfe of the thessalonians teacheth vs in effect thus much that though corruption remaine in the regenerate after regeneration yet in respect of diuine acceptation he is accouted as righteous and so continueth his sinne by the mercie of god in christ not beeing imputed to him to condemnation and so much for that point now these grounds of comfort and others of the like nature may serue to sustaine and vphold the hearts of the children of god when they shall be pressed and troubled in consideration of their estate in this life which cannot till death be fully freed from much weaknes and manifold imperfections the fifth and last kinde of temptation or trouble of mind ariseth from a mans ovvne bodie before i enter to speake thereof one question in the meane time must be answered namely how the bodie should or how it can trouble the minde considering that the soule or mind is not bodily but spirituall and it is against reason that that which is bodily should either alter or trouble a spirit for an answer hereunto these things must be considered first of all the actions of man doe proceede from one onely fountaine and common cause the soule and are done by the power thereof the bodie of it self is not an agent in any work but as it were a dead instrument in amp by which the soule produceth all actions and workes secondly the most of the workes of the soule and minde of man are such as are performed by the bodie and the parts thereof and by the spirits that are seated in the bodie as by instruments indeede some actions of the soule amp mind are done without the helpe of the bodie but i say that the most actions thereof are performed by the bodie and spirits therein contained yet these spirits in theselues are no agent at all but the onely agent in any worke is the soule it selfe for example the vsing of the outward senses as of sight hearing tasting touching smelling as also of the inward as imagination memorie ampc all this is done by the braine and the parts of the braine as proper instruments all affections both good and bad are acted by the soule but yet they come from the heart as the seat thereof so also the power of nourishment comes from the liuer as the instrument whereby the soule nourisheth the bodie now then the bodie affecteth the soule and minde thus the bodie and the soule are so ioyned together that they make one person and thus the bodie beeing troubled the soule is also troubled yet is not this done by any diuiding of the soule for it cannot be diuided neither by diminishing the parts of the soule but onely by corrupting the action of the minde or more properly by corrupting the next instrument of the minde this may be conceiued by a comparison a skilful artificer in any sciece hath an vnfit toole and a naughtie instrument to worke withall his skill is good and his abilitie is sufficient but his instrument whereby he worketh is vnperfect and therefore he brings forth an imperfect worke now his toole takes not away the skill of his workmanship nor his power of working but keepes him fro doing that well which otherwise he should and could doe well in like manner the body beeing corrupted hinders the worke of the soule it doth not take away the worke of the soule nor the abilitie of working but because it is a corrupt instrument it makes the soule to bring forth a corrupt worke the temptation followeth the bodie causeth the trouble of the mind two waies either by melancholie or by other strange alterations in the parts of the bodie which oftentimes befall man in what sort we shall see afterwards for it is a very common thing yes more common then the former touching melancholy sundrie things are to be considered for our instruction and for the remedie of that euill and first of all if it be asked what melancholie is i answer it is a kind of earthie amp black blood that is specially in the splene beeing stopt which conuaieth it selfe to the heart and the braine and there partly by his corrupt subsiace and specially by his contagious qualitie annoyeth both heart and braine beeing the seat amp instrument of reason the second is what are the effects and operations of melancholie ans they are strange and often fearefull there is no humour yes nothing in mans bodie that hath so strange effects as this humour hath beeing once distempered an auncient diuine calls it the deuills bait because the deuill by god iust permissio conueies himselfe into this humour and worketh strange conceits when the euill spirit came vpon saul it so tempted him that he would haue slaine him that was next vnto him how so surely because god in iustice withdrew his spirit of gouernment from him and suffered satan to enter into the humour of choler or melancholie or both and by this meanes caused him to offer violence to dauid now the effects thereof in particular are of two sorts the first effect is in the braine and head for this humour being corrupted it sends vp noysome spirits and filleth the instrument of reason as it were with a myst and makes it vnfit to vse reason hence followes the first effect strange imaginations conceits and opinions framed in the minde which are the first worke of this humor not properly but because it corrupteth the instrument and the instrument beeing corrupted the facultie cannot bring forth good but corrupt actions for example that which they call the beast like melancholie is when a man thinkes himselfe to be a beast of this or that kind and carries himselfe accordingly of this sort are those that thinke themselues to be wolues and practise wolvish behauiour thus we read daniel that nebuchad nezzar liued behaued himselfe and fed as a beast some say that he loss his soule and had the soule of a beast but they er e for there is no such transportation of soules into body either of man or beast others thinke that nebuchadnezzar was smitten in the brain with this disease and in a beastly imagination carried himselfe as a beast and this interpretation is not against the text for in the verse of that chapter it is said that his minde came to him againe and therefore in the disease his vnderstanding amp the right vse of his reason was lost and the like is true in historie by diverse examples though it were not true in nebuchadnezzar againe take another example that is common and ordinarie let a melancholike person vpon the sudden see some fearefull thing the strength of his imagination presently fasteneth the thing vpon himselfe as if he see or heare that a man is hanged or possessed with a deuill it presently comes to his minde that he must be hanged that he is or shall be possessed likewise vpon relation of fearefull things presently his phantasi workes and he imagineth that the thing is alreadie or shall befall him and this imagination when it enters once amp takes place it brings forth horrible and fearefull effects the second effect or worke of melancholie is vpon the heart when the mind hath conceiued and framed fearefull things there is a concord and consent between heart amp affection amp then comes affection and is answerable to imagination hence doe proceede exceeding horrors feares and despaires and yet the coscience for all this vntouched and not troubled or disquieted thirdly it may be demanded whether there be any difference betweene the trouble of coscience and melancholie for many hold that they are all one ans they are not all one but differ much affliction of conscience is one thing trouble by melancholie is another and they are plainly distinguished thus first when the conscience is troubled the affliction it selfe is in the conscience and so in the whole man but in melancholie the imagination is disturbed amp not the conscience secondly the conscience afflicted hath a true and certen cause wherby it is troubled namely the sight of sinne but in melancholie the imagination conceiueth a thing to be so which is not so for it makes a man to feare and despaire vpon supposed and fained causes thirdly the man afflicted in conscience hath courage in many things but the melancholike ma feares euery man euery creature yes himselfe and hath no courage when there is no cause of feare he feares fourthly imaginations in the braine caused by melancholie may be cured taken away and cut off by meanes of physicke but the distresse of conscience cannot be cured by any thing in the world but one and that is the blood of christ and the assurance of god fauour fourthly the way to cure melancholy is this first the person troubled must be brought to this that he will content himselfe to be aduertised and ruled not by his owne but by the iudgement of others touching his owne estate and by this shall be reape much quiet and contentation secondly search amp triall must be made whether he hath in him any beginnings of faith and repentance or no if he want knowledge of his estate then meanes must be vsed to bring him to some sight and sorrow for his sinnes that his melancholy sorrow may be turned into a godly sorrow if he want faith and true repentance some good beginnings thereof must be wrought in his heart thirdly when he is brought to faith in god mercie and an honest purpose not to sinne any more then certaine mercifull promises of god are to be laid before his eies and he must be exhorr d to rest vpon these promises and at no time to admit any imagination or thought that may crosse the said promises now the promises are these and such like psalm no good thing shall be wanting to them that feare god psalm no euill shall come neere the godly man chronicle the lord is with you while you are with him and if you seeke him he will be found of you iam drawe nere to god and he will draw neere to you and the best meanes to cause any man thus diseased to be at peace with himselfe is to hold beleeue amp know the truth of these promises and not to suffer any bythought to enter into his heart that may crosse them moreouer though the former promises may stay the minde yet will they not take away the humour except further helpe be vsed therefore the fourth and last helpe is the arte of physicke which serues to correct and abate the humour because it is a meanes by the blessing of god to restore the health and to cure the distemper of the bodie and thus much touching the trouble of minde caused by melancholy the second meanes whereby the bodie annoies the minde is when it occasions trouble to the minde by strange alterations incident to the bodie when a man beginnes to enter into a phrensie if the braine admit neuer so little alteration presently the minde is troubled thus by the trembling of the heart many fearefull imaginations are caused when a man knowes not the cause the same is procured by the swelling of the splene by the rising of the entralls by strange convulsions and such like the remedie hereof is this first it is still to be considered whether the partie thus troubled hath true faith and repentance or no if he hath it is so much the better if he hath not the first dutie is to vse all meanes to stir vp in him some godly sorrow for his sinnes secondly this beeing done meanes must be vsed to take away the opinion conceiued and to giue information of the alteration of the bodie and of the true cause thereof this beeing knowne the griefe or feare conceiued will easily be staid for take away the false opinion and informe iudgement and the whole man will be the better thirdly the opinion beeing altered and reformed it may be the alteration in the bodie will remaine the partie therefore in that case must be taught that it is a correction of god and that god doth not barely suffer the correction to be inflicted but is the very author of it and therefore the partie is to be well pleased and to reioice in that will of god for euery present estate whether it be good or badde is the best state for vs because it comes by the wil of god and thus much touching the distinct kindes of distresses of minde i adde this one thing further that if we make examination of the estate of such persons as are troubled with any of these fiue temptations we shall not vsually find them single but mixed together especially melancholy with some other temptations and so much of the first sort of questions concerning man simply considered in himselfe

these words are a rule or precept laid down by salomon for weightie causes for in the chapters going before he sets forth the vanity of all creatures vnder heauen amp that at large in the very particulars now man hereupon might take occasion of discontentment in respect of their estate in this life therefore salomo in great wisdome here takes a new course amp in this chapter begins to lay downe certaine rules of direction and comfort that man might haue somwhat wherewith to arme themselues against the troubles and the miseries of this life the first rule is in this third verse that a good name is better then a pretious ointment that is a name gotten and maintained by godly conuersatio is a speciall blessing of god which in the middest of the vanities of this life ministreth greater matter of reioicing and cofort to the heart of man then the most pretious ointment can doe to the outward senses now some man hauing heard this first rule concerning good name might obiect amp say that renowne amp good report in this life affoardes slender comfort cosidering that after it followes death which is the miserable end of all man but this obiection the wise man remooueth by a second rule in the wordes which i haue in hand saying that the day of death is better then the day that one is borne that wee may come to the true amp proper sense of this precept or rule three points are to be cosidered first what is death here mentioned secondly how it can be truly said that the day of death is better then the day of birth thirdly in what respect it is better for the first death is a depriuation of life as a punishment ordained of god and imposed on man for his sinne first i say it is a depriuatio of life because the very nature of death is the absence or defect of that life which god vouchsafed man by his creation i adde further that death is a punishment more especially to intimate the nature and qualitie of death and to shewe that it was ordained as a meanes of the execution of god iustice amp iudgment and that death is a punishment paul plainely auoucheth when he saith that by one man sinne entred into the world and death by sinne and againe that death is the stipend wages or allowance of sinne furthermore in euery punishment there bee three workers the ordainer of it the procurer and the executioner the ordainer of this punishment is god in the estate of mans innocence by a solemne law then made in these very words in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death gen but it may be alleadged to the contrary that the lord saith by the prophet ezechiel that hee will not the death of a sinner amp therefore that hee is no ordainer of death the answer may easily be made amp that sundry waies first the lord speakes not this to all man or of all man but to his owne people the church of the iewes as appeares by the clause prefixed son of man say vnto the house of israel ampc againe the words are not spoken absolutelu but onely in way of comparisoy in that of the twaine he rather wills the conuersion and repentance of a sinner then his death and destruction thirdly the very proper meaning of the words import thus much that god doth take no delight or pleasure in the death of a sinner as it is the ruine and destruction of the creature and yet al this hinders not but that god in a newe regard and consideration may both will amp ordaine death namely as it is a due and deserued punishment tending to the execution of iustice in which iustice god is as good as in his mercie againe it may be obiected that if death indeede had beene ordained of god then adam should haue bin destroied amp that presently vpo his fal for the very words are thus whesoeuer thou shalt eat of the forbidden fruite thou shalt certenly die ans sentences of scripture are either legall or euangelical the law amp the gospell beeing two seuerall and distinct parts of god word now this former sentence is legall amp must be vnderstood with an exception borrowed from the gospel or the couenat of grace made with adam and reuealed to him after his fall the exception is this thou shalt certenly die whensoeuer thou eatest the forbidden fruite except i doe further giue thee a means of deliuerance from death namely the seede of the woman to bruise the serpents head secondly it may be answered that adam and all his posteritie died and that presently after his fall in that his bodie was made mortall and his soule became subiect to the curse of the law and whereas god would not vtterly destroy adam at the very first but onely impose on him the beginnings of the first and second death he did the same in great wisedome that in his iustice he might make a way to mercie which thing could not haue beene if adam had perished the executioner of this punishmet is he that doth impose and inflict the same on man amp that also is god himselfe as he testifieth of himselfe in the prophet esai i make peace and create euill nowe euill is of three sorts naturall morall material natural euill is the destruction of that order which god set in euery creature by the creation moral euill is the want of that righteousnesse and vertue which the law requires at mans hands amp that is called sin material euill is any matter or thing which in it selfe is a good creature of god yet so as by reaso of mans fall it is hurtful to the health amp life of man as henbane wolfebane hemlock amp all other poisons are now this saying of esai must not bee vnderstood of morall euils but of such as are either materiall or naturall to the latter of which death is to be referred which is the destruction or abolishment of mans nature created the procurer of death is man not god in that man by his sin and disobedience did pull vpon himselfe this punishment therefore the lord in oseah o israel one hath destroyed thee but in me is thine helpe against this it may be obiected that ma was mortall in the estate of innocencie before the fall answer the frame and composition of mans body considered in it selfe was mortall because it was made of water amp earth amp other elements which are of theselues alterable and changeable yet if we respect that grace and blessing which god did vouchsafe mans bodie in his creation it was vnchangeable and immortall and so by the same blessing should haue continued if man had not fallen and man by his fall depriuing himselfe of this gift and blessing became euery way mortall thus it appeares in part what death is yet for the better clearing of this point we are to consider the difference of the death of a man and of a beast the death of a beast is the total and finall abolishment of the whole creature for the body is resolued to his first matter and the soule arising of the temperature of the bodie vanisheth to nothing but in the death of a man it is otherwise for though the bodie for a time bee resolued to dust yet must it rise againe in the last iudgement and become immortall and as for the soule it subsisteth by it selfe out of the body and is immortall and this being so it may be demauded how the soule can die the second death ans the soule dies not because it is vtterly abolished but because it is as though it were not amp it ceaseth to be in respect of righteousnes and fellowship with god and indeede this is the death of all death when the creature hath subsisting and beeing and yet for all that is depriued of al cofortable fellowship with god the reason of this difference is because the soule of man is a spirit or spirituall substance wheras the soule of a beast is no substance but a naturall vigour or qualitie and hath no being in itselfe without the bodie on which it wholy dependeth the soule of a man contrariwise being created of nothing amp breathed into the bodie and as well subsisting forth of it as in it the kindes of death are two as the kindes of life are bodily and spirituall bodily death is nothing else but the separation of the soule from the body as bodily life is the conujnction of bodie and soule and this death is called the first because in respect of time it goes before the second spiritual death is the separatio of the whole man both in body and soule from the gratious fellowshippe of god of these twaine the first is but an entrance to death and the second is the accomplishment of it for as the soule is the life of the body so god is the life of the soule and his spirit is the soule of our soules and the want of fellowship with him brings nothing but the endles and vnspeakable horrours and pangs of death againe spirituall death hath three distinct and seuerall degrees the first is when a man that is aliue in respect of temporall life lies dead in sin of this degree paul speakes when hee saith but shee that liueth in pleasure is dead while shee liueth and this is the case of all man by nature who are children of wrath and dead in sinnes and trespasses the second degree is in the very end of this life whe the body is laide in the earth amp the soule descendes to the place of torments the third degree is in the day of iudgement when the body and soule meete againe and goe both to the place of the damned there to bee tormented for euer and euer hauing thus found the nature and differences and kindes of death it is more then manifest that the text in hand is to be vnderstood not of the spiritual but of the bodily death because it is opposed to the birth or natiuitie of man the words then must cary this sense the time of bodily death in which the body and soule of man are seuered asunder is better then the time in which one is borne and brought into the world thus much of the first point now followeth the secod amp that is how this can be true which salomon saith that the day of death is better then the day of birth i make not this question to call the scriptures into controuersie which are the truth it selfe but i doe it for this ende that we might without wauering be resolued of the truth of this which salomon auoucheth for there may be sundrie reasons brought to the contrarie therfore let vs now hadle the question the reasons or obiections which may be alleadged to the contrarie may all bee reduced to sixe heads the first is taken from the opinion of wise man who think it the best thing of all neuer to bee borne amp the next best to die quickly now if it be the best thing in the world not to bee borne at all then it is the worst thing that can bee to die after a man is borne answer there be two sorts of man one that liue and die in their sinnes without repentance the other which vnfainedly repent amp beleeue in christ now this sentence maybe truly auouched of the first of whome wee may say as christ said of iudas it had bin good for him that he had neuer bin borne but the saying applied to the second sort of man is false for to them that in this life turne to god by repentance the best thing of all is to bee borne because their birth is a degree of preparation to happinesse and the next best is to die quickly because by death they enter into possessio of the same their happinesse for this cause balaam desired to die the death of the righteous and salomon in this place prefers the day of death before the day of birth vnderstading that death which is ioyned with godly life or the death of the righteous the second obiection is taken from the testimonies of scripture death is ths wages of sinne rom it is an enemy of christ corinthian and the curse of the lawe hence it seemes to followe that in and by death man receiue their wages amp paiment for their sinnes that the day of death is the dolefull day in which the enemie preuailes against vs that he which dieth is cursed answer we must distinguish of death it must be considered two waies first as it is by it selfe in his own nature secodly as it is altered amp changed by christ now death by it selfe considered is indeed the wages of sinne an enemie of christ amp of all his members amp the curse of the law yes the very suburbs and the gates of hell yet in the second respect it is not so for by the vertue of the death of christ it ceaseth to be a plague or punishment and of a curse it is made a blessing and is become vnto vs a passage or middle way betweene this life and eternall life and as it were a litle wicket or doore whereby wee passe out of this world and enter into heauen and in this respect the saying of salomon is most true for in the day of birth man are borne amp brought forth into the vale of misery but afterward when they goe hence hauing death altered vnto the by the death of christ they enter into eternall ioy and happinesse with al the saints of god for euer the third obiection is taken from the exaples of most worthie man who haue made their prayers against death as our sauiour christ who praied on this manner father if it bee thy will let this cup passe from mee yet not my will but thy will bee done and dauid praied returne o lord d liuer my soule saue me for thy mercies sake for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the graue who shall praise thee and ezechiah when the prophet esay bade him set his house in order and told him that he must die wept sore amp that in respect of death now by the examples of these most worthy man yes by the example of the son of god himself it may seeme that the day of death is the most terrible amp doleful day of all ans whe our sauiour christ praied thus to his father he was in his agonie and he then as our redeemer stood in our roome and stead to suffer all things that we should haue suffered in our own persons for our sinnes and therefore hee praied not simply agaist death but against the cursed death of the crosse and he feared not death it selfe which is the separation of body and soule but the curse of the lawe which went with death namely the vnspeakable wrath and indignation of god the first death troubled him not but the first and second ioyned togither touching dauid whe he made the sixt psalme he was not onely sicke in body but also perplexed with the greatest temptation of all in that hee wrestled in conscience with the wrath of god as appeares by the words of the text where hee saith lord rebuke me not in thy wrath and by this we see that hee praied not simply against death but against death at that instant whe he was in that grieuous temptation for at other times hee had no such feare of death as hee himselfe testifieth saying though i should walke thorough the valley of the shadowe of death i will feare no euill therefore he praied against death only as it was ioyned with the apprehesion of god wrath lastly ezechiah prayed against death not onely because he desired to liue and doe seruice to god in his kingdome but vpon a further and more speciall regard because when the prophet brought the message of death hee was without issue and had none of his owne bodie to succeede him in his kingdome it will be said what warrant had ezechiah to pray against death for this cause ans his warrant was good for god had made a particular promise to dauid amp his posteritie after him that so long as they feared god amp walked in his commandemets they should not want issue to sit vpon the throne of the kingdome after them now ezechiah at the time of the prophets message remembring what promise god had made and how he for his part had kept the codition thereof in that hee had walked before god with an vpright heart and had done that which was acceptable in his sight hee praied against death not so much because hee feared the danger of it but because he wanted issue this praier god accepted and heard and he added fifteene yeares vnto his daies amp two yeares after gaue him manasses the fourth obiection is that those which haue been reputed to be of the better sort of man oftetimes haue miserable ends for some end their daies despairing some rauing and blaspheming some straungely tormented it may seeme therefore that the day of death is the day of greatest woe amp miserie to this i answer first of all generally that we must not iudge of the estate of any man before god by outward things whether they be blessings or iudgements whether they fal in life or death for as salomon saith all things come like to all and the same condition is to the iust and the wicked to the good and to the pure and to the polluted and to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath secondly i answer the particulars which be alleadged on this manner and first of all touching dispaire it is true that not only wicked and loose persons despaire in death but also repentant sinners who oftentimes in their sickenesse testifie of themselues that beeing aliue and lying in their beddes they feele themselues as it were to be in hell and to apprehend the very pangs and torments thereof and i doubt not for all this but that the child of god most deare vnto him may through the gulfe of desperation attaine to euerlasting happinesse this appeares by the maner of god dealing in the matter of our saluation all the workes of god are done in amp by their contraries in the creation all things were made not of some thing but of nothing cleane contrary to the course of nature in the worke of redemption god giues life not by life but by death and if we consider aright of christ vpon the crosse we shall see our paradise out of paradise in the middest of hel eor out of his owne cursed death doeth he bring vs life and eternall happinesse likewise in effectuall vocation when it pleaseth god to conuert and turne man vnto him he doeth it by the meanes of the gospel preached which in reason should driue all man from god for it is as contrarie to the nature of man as fire to water and light to darknesse and yet for al this though it bee thus against the disposition and heart of man it preuailes with him and turnes him to god furthermore whe god will send his owne servant to heauen he sends them a contrarie waie euen by the gates of hell and when it is his pleasure to make man depend on his fauour and prouidence hee makes them feele his anger and to bee nothing in themselues that they may wholly depend vpon him and bee whatsoeuer they are in him this point beeing well considered it is manifest that the childe of god may passe to heauen by the very gulfes of hel the loue of god is like a sea into which when a man is cast hee neither feeles bottome nor sees bank i conclude therfore that dispaire whether it arise of weakenesse of nature or of conscience of sinne though it fall out about the time of death cannot preiudice the saluation of them that are effectually called as for other straunge euents which fall out in death they are the effects of diseases rauings and blasphemings arise of the disease of melancholy and of frensies which often happen at the end of burning feuers the choller shooting up to the braine the writhing of the lippes the turning of the necke the buckling of the ioints and the whole bodie proceede of crampes and convulsions which followe after much euacuatio and wheras some in sicknesse are of that strength that three or foure me cannot hold the without bonds it comes not of witchcraft and possessions as people commonly thinke but of choller in the veines and wheras some when they are dead become as black as pitch as bonner was it may arise by a bruise or an impostume or by the blacke iaundise or by the putrefactio of the liuer amp it doth not alwaies argue some extraordinarie iudgement of god nowe these and the like diseases with their simptomes amp strange effects though they shall depriue man of his health amp of the right vse of the parts of his bodie and of the vse of reason too yet they can not depriue his soule of eternal life and all sinnes procured by violent diseases and proceeding from repentant sinners are sins of infirmity for which if they know them and come againe to the vse of reason they will further repent if not they are pardoned and buried in the death of christ and we ought not so much to stand vpon the stragenesse of any mans end when we know the goodnesse of his life for wee must iudge a man not by his death but by his life and if this be true that strange diseases and thereupon strange behauiours in death may befal the best man that is wee must learne to reforme our iudgements of such as lie at the point of death the common opinio is that if a man lie quietly and goe away like a lambe which in some diseases as consumption and such like any man may do then he goes straight to heaue but if the violece of the disease stirre vp impatience and cause in the partie franticke behauiours then man vse to say there is a iudgement of god seruing either to discouer an hypocrite or to plague a wicked man but the truth is otherwise for indeed a ma may die like a lamb and yet goe to hell and one dying in exceeding torments and strange behauiours of the body may go to heaue amp by the outward conditio of any ma either in life or death we are not to iudge of his estate before god the fourth obiection is this whe a man is most nere death then the diuell is most busie in temptatio amp the more man are assaulted by satan the more dagerous and troublesome is their case and therfore it may seeme that the day of death is the worst day of all answer the condition of god childre in earth is twofold some are not tempted amp some are some i say are not tempted as simeon who when he had seen christ brake forth and saide lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace ampc fore signifying no doubt that hee should end his daies in all maner of peace as for them which are tepted though their case bee very troublesome and perplexed yet their saluation is not further off by reaso of the violence amp extremity of temptation for god is then present by the vnspeakable comfort of his spirit amp when wee are most weake he is most strong in vs because his manner is to shewe his power in weakenes and for this cause euen in the time of death the diuell receiues the greatest foyle when he lookes for the greatest victorie the sixt obiection is this violent amp sudden death is a grieuous curse amp of all euills which befal man in this life none is so terrible therefore it may seeme that the day of sudden death is most miserable ans it is true indeede that sudden death is a curse amp grieuous iudgement of god and therefore not without cause feared of me in the world yet all things considered wee ought more to be afraid of an impenitent and evil life then of sudden death for though it be euill as death it selfe in his own nature is yet we must not think it to be simply evil because it is not euill to al man nor in all respects euill i say it is not euill to all man considering that no kinde of death is euill or a curse vnto them that are in christ who are freed from the whole curse of the law and therefore the holy ghost saith blessed are they that die in the lord for they rest from their labours whereby is signified that they which depart this life being members of christ enter into euerlasting happines of what death so euer they die yes though it be sudden death againe i say that sudden death is not euill in all respects for it is not euill because it is sudden but because it commonly takes man vnprepared and by that means makes the day of death a blacke day and as it were a very speedie downe fall to the gulfe of hell otherwise if a man be readie amp prepared to die sudden death is in effect no death but a quicke and speedie entrance to eternal life these obiections being thus answered it appeares to bee a manifest truth which salomon saith that the day of death is better indeede then the day of birth now i come to the third point in which the reasons amp respects are to be considered that make the day of death to surpasse the day of mans birth amp they may al be reduced to this one namely that the birth day is an entrance into al woe and miserie whereas the day of death ioyned with godly and reformed life is an entrance or degree to eternal life which i make manifest thus eternall life hath three degrees one in this life when a man can truely say that hee liues not but that christ liues in him and this al man can say that repent and belieue and are iustified amp sanctified amp haue peace of conscience with other gifts of god spirit which are the earnest of their saluation the second degree is the ende of this life when the bodie goes to the earth amp the soule is carried by the angels into heaue the third is in the end of the world at the last iudgement whe body amp soule reunited do ioyntly enter into eternal happines in heaue now of these three degrees death it selfe being ioyned with the feare of god is the second which also containeth in it two worthie steps to life the first is a freedome from all miseries which haue their ende in death for though man in this life are subiect to manifold dangers by sea and land as also to sundry aches paines aad diseases as feauers and consumption ampc yet when death comes there is an end of al again so long as man liue in this world whatsoeuer they be they doe in some part lie in bondage vnder originall corruption and the remnants thereof which are doubtings of god prouidence vnbeliefe pride of heart ignorance couetousnes ambition enuy hatred lust and such like sinnes which bring forth fruits vnto death and to bee in subiection to sin on this manner is a misery of al miseries therfore paul whe he was tempted vnto sinne by his corruptio cals the very teptation the buffets of satan and as it were a pricke or thorne wounding his flesh and paining him at the very heart againe in an other place wearied with his owne corruptions he coplaines that he is sold vnder sinne and he cries out miserable man that i am who shall deliuer me from this body of death dauid saith that his eies gushed out with river of teares when other man sinned against god how much more then was he grieued for the sinnes wherewith he himselfe was ouertaken in this life and indeede it is a very hell for a man that hath but a sparke of grace to be exercised turmoyled and tempted with the inborne corruptions and rebellions of his owne heart and if a man would deuise a torment for such as feare god and desire to walke in newnes of life he can not deuise a greater then this for this cause blessed is the day of death which brings with it a freedome from all sinne whatsoeuer for when we die the corruption of nature is quite abolished amp sanctification is accomplished lastly it is a great miserie that the people of god are constrained in this world to liue amp conuerse in the company of the wicked as sheepe are mingled with goats which strike them annoy their pasture and muddie their water hereupon dauid cried out woe is me that i remaine in meshech and dwell in the tents of kedar when elijah saw that ahab and iesabel had planted idolatry in israel and that they sought his life also he went apart into the wildernesse and desired to die but this misery also is ended in the day of death in as much as death is as it were the hand of god to sort and single out those that be the servant of god from all vngodly man in this most wretched world furthermore this exceeding benefite comes by death that it doth not only abolish the miseries which presently are vpo vs but also preuet those which are to come the righteous saith the prophet esay perisheth and no man considereth it in his heart and mercifull man are taken away and no man vnderstandeth that the righteous is taken away from the euill to come example of this we haue in iosias because saith the lord thine heart did melt and thou hast humbled thy selfe before the lord when thou heardest what i spake against this place ampc beholde therefore i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be put in thy graue in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the euill which i will bring vpon this place and paul saith that among the corinthians some were a sleepe that is dead that they might not bee condemned with the world thus much of freedome from miserie which is the first benefit that comes by death amp the first steppe to life now followes the second which is that death giues an entrance to the soule that it may come into the presence of the euerliuing god of christ and of all the angels and saints in heauen the worthinesse of this benefite makes the death of the righteous to bee no death but rather a blessing to bee wished of all man the consideration of this made paul to say i desire to be dissolued but what is the cause of this desire that followes in the next words namely that by his dissolution he might come to be with christ whe the queene of sheba saw all salomons wisdome amp the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servant amp the order of his ministers and their apparel ampc she said happie are thy man happy are these thy servant which stand euer before thee and heare thy wisdome much more then may wee say that they are ten thousand fold happie which stand not in the presence of an earthly king but before the king of kings the lord of heauen and earth and at his right hand inioy pleasures for euermore moses hath bin renowned in all ages for this that god vouchsafed him but so much fauour as to see his hinder parts at his request then what happines is this to see the glory and maiestie of god face to face and to haue eternall fellowship with god our father christ our redeemer and the holy ghost our comforter and to liue with the blessed saints amp angels in heauen for euer thus now the third point is manifest namely in what respects death is more excellent the life it may be here the mind of ma vnsatisfied wil yet further reply amp say that howsoeuer in death the soules of man enter into heauen yet their body though they haue bin tenderly kept for meat drink amp apparel and haue slept many a night in beds of doune must lie in dark amp loathsome graues amp there be wasted amp cosumed with worms ans all this is true indeede but all is nothing if so be it we will but cosider aright of our graues as we ought we must not iudge of our graues as they appeare to the bodily eye but we must looke vpon them by the eye of faith and consider them as they are altered and changed by the death and burial of christ who hauing vanquished death vpon the crosse pursued him afterward to his owne wen and foyled him there amp depriued him of his power and by this means christ in his owne death hath buried our death and by the vertue of his buriall as with sweete incense hath sweetened and perfumed our graues and made the of stinking amp loathsome cabbines to become princely pallaces and beddes of most sweete amp happie rest farre more excellent then beddes of doune and though the body rot in the graue or be eate of worms or of fish in the sea or burnt to ashes yet that will not be vnto vs a matter of discomfort if we do well consider the ground of all grace namely our coniunction with christ it is indeede a spirituall and yet a most reall coniunction and we must not imagine that our soules alone are ioyned to the body or soule of christ but the whole person of man both in body and soule is ioyned and vnited to whole christ and when we are once ioyned to christ in this mortall life by the bond of the spirit we shall remaine amp continue eternally ioyned with him and this vnio once truly made shal neuer be dissolued hence it followes that although the body bee seuered from the soule in death yet neither body nor soule are seuered from christ but the very bodie rotting in the graue drowned in the sea burned to ashes abides still vnited to him and is as truely a member of christ the as before this point we must remember as the foundation of all our comfort and hold it for euer as a truth for looke what was the condition of christ in death the same or the like is the conditio of all his members now the condition of christ was this though his bodie and soule were seuered each from other as far as heauen amp the graue yet neither of them were seuered from the godhead of the sone but both did in death subsist in his perso and therefore though our body and soules bee pulled asunder by natural or violent death yet neither of them no not the body it selfe shall be seuered amp disioyned from christ it wil be alleadged that if the body were then vnited to christ it should liue and bee quickened in the graue ans not so when a mans arme or legge is taken with the dead palsy it receiues litle or no heat life sense or motion from the body and yet notwithstanding it remaines still a member of the bodie because the flesh amp the bone of it remaine ioyned to the flesh and the bone of the body euen so may the body remaine a member of christ though for some space of time it receiue neither sense nor motion nor life from the soule or from the spirit of christ furthermore we must remeber that by the vertue of this coiunction shal the dead body be it rotten burned deuoured or howsoeuer cosumed at the day of iudgment rise to eternall glory in the winter season trees remaine without fruite or leaues and being beaten with winde amp weather appeare to the eie as if they were rotten trees yet when the spring time comes againe they bring forth as before buds and blossomes leaues and fruit the reason is because the bodie graines amp armes of the tree are al ioyned to the root where lies the sap in the winter season and whence by means of this coniuction it is deriued to al the parts of the tree in the spring time euen so the body of man haue their winter also in which they are turned to dust amp so remaine for the space of many thousand yeares yet in the day of iudgement by means of that mistical coniunction with christ shall diuine and quickening vertue streame thence to al the body of the elect to cause the to liue againe and that to life eternall but some will say that the wicked also rise again ans they do so indeede but not by the same cause for they rise by the power of christ as he is a iudge to codemn the wheras the godly rise againe by the vertue of christs resurrection whereof they are partakers by meanes of that blessed and indissoluble coniuction which they haue with christ and the body of the elect though they cosume neuer so much in the graue yet are they still in god fauour and in the couenat of grace to which because they haue right beeing dead they shall not remaine so for euer but shal rise to glory at the last iudgement therefore the rotting of the bodie is nothing in respect and the death of the body no death and therfore also death in the old amp new testament is made but a sleep amp the graue a bed wherof the like was neuer seene wherein a man may rest nothing at al troubled with dreames or fantasies and whence hee shall rise no more subiect to weakenes or sickenes but presently be translated to eternal glory by this the which hath beene said it appeares that the death of the righteous is a second degree to euerlasting happinesse now then considering our coniunction with christ is the foundation of all our ioy amp cofort in life and death wee are in the feare of god to learne this one lesso namely that while we haue time in this world we must labour to be vnited vnto christ that we maybe bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh this very point is as it were a flaggon of wine to reuiue our soules when they be in a swowne at any instant and that we may be assured that we are certainly ioyned to christ we must shew our selues to be members of his misticall body by the daily fruites of righteousnes and true repentance and being once certainly assured in conscience of our beeing in christ let death come when it wil amp let it cruelly part asunder both body amp soule yet shall they both remaine in the couenant and by meanes thereof be reunited and taken vp to life eternall whereas on the contrary if man be out of the couenant and die out of christ their soules goe to hell and their body rot for a time in the graue but afterward they rise to endlesse perdition wherefore i say againe and againe labour that your consciences by the holy ghost may testifie that ye are liuing stones in the temple of god amp branches bearing fruite in the true vine amp then ye shall feele by experience that the pangs of death shall be a further degree of happinesse then euer ye found in your liues euen then when ye are gasping and panting for breath thus much of the meaning of the text now followes the vses amp they are manifold the first amp principall is this in that salomon preferres the day of death before the day of birth he doth therein giue vs to vnderstand that there is a direct amp certain way wherby a man may die well and if it had beene otherwise he could not haue said that the day of death is better and wheras he auoucheth this he shewes withal that there is an infallible way whereby a man may make a blessed end therefore let vs now come to search out this way the knowledge and true vnderstanding wherof must not be fetched from the writings of man but from the word of god who hath the power of life and death in his owne hand now that a man may die well god word requires things a preparation before death and a right behauiour and disposition in death the preparation vnto death is an action of a repentant sinner whereby he makes himself fit and ready to die and it is a dutie very necessary to which we are bound by god commadement for there bee sundrie places of scripture which doe straightly inioyn vs to watch amp pray amp to make our selues readie euery way against the secod comming of christ to iudgement now the same places doe withall bind vs to make preparation against death at which time god comes to iudgement vnto vs particularly againe look as death leaueth a man so shall the last iudgement finde him and so shall hee abide eternally there may bee changes amp conuersions from euill to good in this life but after death there is no change at all therefore a preparation to death can in no wise be omitted of him that desires to make an happie amp blessed end this preparation is twofold generall amp particular generall preparation is that whereby a man prepares himselfe to die through the whole course of his life a duty most needefull that must in no wise be omitted the reasons are these first of all death which is certaine is most vncertaine i say it is certain because no man can eschew death and it is vncerten waies first in regard of time for no man knoweth when hee shall die secondly in regard of place for no man knowes where he shall die whether in his bedde or in the field whether by sea or by land thirdly in respect of the kind of death for no ma knows whether he shal dy of a lingring or sudden of a violent or naturall death hence it follows that man should euery day prepare themselues to death indeede if wee could know when where and how we should die the case were otherwise but seeing wee know none of these it stands vs in hand to looke about vs a second reason seruing further to perswade vs is this the most daungerous thing of all in this world is to neglect all preparation to make this point more manifest i will vse this comparison a certaine man pursued by an vnicorne in his flight fals into a dungeon amp in his fall takes hold and hangs by the arme of a tree now as hee thus hangs looking downeward he sees two wormes gnawing at the root of the tree and as he looks vpward he sees an hiue of most sweet hony wherupo he climes vp vnto it and sitting by it he feeds theron in the meane season while he is thus sitting the two wormes gnaw in pieces the root of the tree which don tree and man amp all fal into the bottome of the dungeon now this vnicorn is death the man that flieth is euery one of vs and euery liuing man the pit ouer which he hangeth is hell the arme of the tree is life it self the two wormes are day and night the continuance whereof is the whole life of man the hiue of honie is the pleasures and profit and honours of this world to which when man wholly giue theselues not considering their ends til the tree root that is this temporall life be cut off which beeing once done they plunge theselues quite into the gulfe of hell by this we see that there is good cause that man should not deferre their preparation till the time of sicknes but rather euery day make themselues readie against the day of death but some will say it shall suffice if i prepare my selfe to pray when i begin to be sicke answer these man greatly deceiue theselues for the time the is most vnfit to begin a preparation because all the senses amp powers of the body are occupied about the pains and troubles of the disease and the sicke party is exercised partly in conference with the physitian partly with the minister about his soules health and matters of conscience and partly with friends that come to visit therfore there must some preparation goe before in the time of health when the whole man with all the powers of body and soule are at liberty again there be some others which imagine and say that a man may repent when he wil euen in the time of death and that such repentance is sufficiet ans it is false which they say for it is not in the power of man to repet when he himselfe will when god will he may it is not in him that willeth or runneth but in god that hath mercy and christ saith that many shal seek to enter into heauen and shal not be able but why so because they seeke when it is too late namly when the time of grace is past therefore it is exceeding follie for man so much as once to dream that they may haue repentance at comand nay it is a iust iudgement that they should be condemned of god in death that did codemne god in their life and that they should quite be forgotten of god in sicknesse and did forget god in their health again i answer that this late repetance is seldome or neuer true repentance it is sicke like the party himselfe comonly languishing and dying together with him repentance should be voluntary as all obedience to god ought but repetance taken vp in sicknes is vsually constrained amp extorted by the feare of hell amp other iudgements of god for crosses afflictions and sicknes wil cause the grosses hypocrite that euer was to stoope and buckle vnder the hand of god and to dissemble faith and repentance and euery grace of god as though he had them as fully as any of the true servant of god wheras indeed he wants the altogether wherfore such repentance commonly is but counterfeit for in true amp sound repentance man must forsake their sinnes but in this the sinne forsakes the man who leaues all his euill waies onely vpon this that he is constrained to leaue the world wherefore it is a thing greatly to be wished that man would repent amp prepare themselues to die in the time of health before the day of death or sicknesse come lastly it is alleadged that one of the theeues repented vpon the crosse ans the thiefe was called after the eleuenth houre at the point of the twelfth when he was now dying and drawing on therefore his conuersion was altogether miraculous and extraordinarie and there was a speciall reaso why christ would haue him to be called then that while he was in suffering he might shew forth the vertue of his passion that all which saw the one might also acknowledge the other now it is not good for man to make an ordinarie rule of an extraordinarie example thus then this point beeing manifest that a generall preparation must be made let vs now see in what manner it must be done and for the right doing of it fiue duties must be practised in the course of our liues the first is the meditation of death in the life time for the life of a christian is nothing els but a meditatio of death a notable practise hereof we haue in the example of ioseph of arimathea who made his tombe in his life time in the middest of his garden no doubt for this ende to put himself in mind of death and that in the midst of his delight and pleasures heathen philosophers that neuer knew christ had many excellent meditations of death though not comfortable in regard of life euerlasting now wee that haue knowne and beleeued in christ must goe beyond them in this point considering with our selues such things as they neuer thought of namely the cause of death our sinne the remedie thereof the cursed death of christ cursed i say in regard of the kinde of death and punishment laid vpon him but blessed in regard of vs thirdly we must often meditate of the presence of death which wee doe when by god grace we make an account of euery present day as if it were the day of our death amp reckon with our selues when we goe to bed as though we should neuer rise againe and when we rise as though wee should neuer lie downe againe this meditation of death is of speciall vse and brings forth many fruits in the life of man and first of al it serues to humble vs vnder the hand of god example we haue of abraham who said behold i haue begunne now to speake to my lord and i am but dust and ashes marke here how the consideration of his mortality made him to abase amp cast downe himselfe in the sight of god and thus if we could reckon of euery day as of the last day it would pull down our peacocks feathers and make vs with iob to abhorre our selues in dust and ashes secondly this meditation is a meanes to further repentance when ionas came to niniuie amp cried yet fourty daies and niniue shall bee destroyed the whole citie repented in sackecloath and ashes when elijah came to ahab and tolde him that the dogges should eate iesabel by the wall of iesreel amp him also of ahabs stocke that died in the citie ampc it made him to humble himself so as the lord saith to elijah seest thou how ahab is humbled before me now if the remebrance of death was of such force in him that was but an hypocrite how excellent a meanes of grace will it be in them that truely repent thirdly this meditatio seems to stirre vp contentation in euery estate and condition of life that shall befall vs righteous iob in the midst of his afflictions comforts himself with this consideration naked saith he cam i forth of my mothers wombe and naked shall i returne againe ampc blessed bee the name of the lord and surely the often meditation of this that a man of al his aboundance can carrie nothing with him but either a coffin or a winding sheete or both should bee a forcible meanes to represse the vnsatiable desire of riches amp the loue of this world thus we see what an effectuall meanes this meditation is to encrease and further the grace of god in the hearts of man now i commend this first duty to your christian considerations desiring the practice of it in your liues which practise that it may take place two things must be performed labour to plucke out of your hearts a wicked amp erroneous imagination whereby euery man naturally blesseth himselfe and thinkes highly of himselfe and though he had one foote in the graue yet he perswades himselfe that he shall not die yet there is no man almost so olde but by the corruptio of his hart he thinks that he shall liue one yeare longer cruell amp vnmerciful death makes league with no man and yet the prophet esai saith that the wicked man makes a league with death how can this bee there is no league made indeed but onely in the wicked imaginatio of man who falsly thinkes that death will not come neere him though al the world should be destroied see an example in the parable of the rich ma that hauing stored vp abundance of wealth for many years said vnto his own soule soule thou hast much goods laid vp for many yeres liue at ease eate drinke and take thy pastime wheras his soule was fetched away presetly and seeing this natural corruption is in euery mans hart we must daily fight against it and labour by al might amp maine that it take no place in vs for so long as it shall preuaile we shall be vtterly vnfit to make any preparation to death we ought rather to indeauour to attaine to the mind and meditation of s hierome who testifieth of himself on this manner whether i wake or sleepe or whatsoeuer i doe me thinkes i heare the sound of the trumpet rise ye dead and come to iudgement the second thing which we are to practise that wee may come to a serious meditation of our owne ends is to make praier vnto god that we might bee inabled to resolue our selues of death continually thus dauid praied lord make me to knowe mine ende and the measure of my daies let mee knowe how long i haue to liue and moses lord teach me to number my daies that i may apply mine heart vnto wisedom it may be said what need me pray to god that they may be able to number their daies can not they of themselues reckon a fewe yeares and daies that are able by arte to measure the globe of the earth and the spheres of heauen amp the quantities of the starres with their longitudes latitudes altitudes motions amp distances from the earth no verily for howesoeuer by a generall speculation we thinke something of our ends yet vnlesse the spirit of god be our schoole master to teach vs our dutie wee shall neuer bee able soundly to resolue our selues of the presence and speedinesse of death and therfore let vs pray with dauid and moses that god would inlighten our minds with knowledge and fil our hearts with his grace that we might rightly consider of death and esteeme of euery day an houre as it were the day and houre of death the second dutie in this generall preparation is that euery man must daily indeauour to take away from his owne death the power and strength thereof and i pray you marke this point the philistims sawe by experience that sampson was of great strength amp therfore they vsed meanes to knowe in what part of his bodie it lay amp when they found it to be in the haire of his head they ceased not vntil it was cut off in like manner the time wil come whe we must encouter hand to hand with tyranous and cruel death the best therefore is before hand now while wee haue time to search where the stregth of death lies which beeing once knowne we must with speed cut off his sapsons lockes and bereaue him of his power disarme him amp make him altogether vnable to preuaile against vs now to find out this matter we neede not to vse the councel of any dalilah for wee haue the word of god which teacheth vs plaily where the strength of death consists namly in our sins as paul saith the sting of death is sinne well then we knowing certenly that the power and force of euery mans partirular death lies in his owne sinnes must spend our time and studie in vsing good meanes that our sinnes may be remooued and pardoned and therefore we must daily inure our selues in the practise of two duties one is to humble our selues for al our sins past partly cofessing the against our selues partly in praier crying to heaue for the pardon of them the other is for time to come to turn vnto god and to carrie a purpose resolution amp indeauour in all things to reforme both hart amp life according to god word these are the very principall amp proper duties wherby the power of death is much rebated amp he is made of a mighty amp bloody enemie so far forth friendly and tractable that we may with comfort incounter with him amp preuaile too therefore i commend these duties to your christian considerations amp carefull practise desiring that ye would spend your daies euer hereafter in doing of them if a man were to deale with a mighty dragon or serpent hand to hand in such wise as he must either kill or be killed the best thing were to bereaue him of his sting or of that part of the body where his poison lies now death it selfe is a serpent dragon or scorpion amp sinne is the sting and poison whereby he wounds amp kils vs wherefore without any more delay see that ye pull out his sting the practise of the foresaid duties is as it were a fit amp worthy instrument to do the deed hast thou beene a person ignorant of god will a contemner of his word and worship a blasphemer of his name a breaker of his sabbaths disobedient to parents and magistrates a murder a fornicatour a rayler a slanderer a couetous perso ampc reforme these thy sinnes and all other like to them pull the out by the rootes from thy heart amp cast them off so many sinnes as be in thee so many stings of death be also in thee to wound thy soule to eternal death therfore let no one sin remaine for which thou hast not humbled thy selfe and repented seriously when death hurts any man it takes the weapons whereby he is hurt from his owne hand it cannot do vs the least hurt but by the force of our owne sins wherefore i say againe and againe lay this point to your hearts amp spend your strength life and health that ye may before ye die abolish the strength of death a man may put a serpent in his bosome when the sting is out amp we may let death creepe into our bosomes and gripe vs with his legs and stab vs at the heart so long as he brings not his venime and poison with him and because the former duties are so necessary as none can be more i wil vse some reasons yet furder to inforce the whatsoeuer a man would doe when he is dying the same he ought to doe euery day while he is liuing now the most notorious and wicked person that euer was when he is dying will pray and desire others to pray for him amp promise amendment of life protesting that if he might liue he would become a practitioner in all the good duties of faith repentance amp reformation of life oh therfore be careful to do this euery day again the saying is true he that would liue when he is dead must die while he is aliue namely to his sins wouldest thou then liue eternally sue to heauen for thy pardon and see that now in thy life time thou die to thine own sinnes lastly wicked balaam would faine die the death of the righteous but alas it was to small purpose for he would by no means liue the life of the righteous for his cotinual purpose and meaning was to follow his olde waies in sorceries amp couetousnesse now the life of a righteous man standes in the humbling of himself for his sinnes past and in a carefull reformatio of life to come wouldest thou then die the death of the righteous then looke vnto it that thy life be the life of the righteous if ye will needes liue the life of the vnrighteous yee must looke to die the death of the vnrighteous remeber this and content not your selues to heare the word but be doers of it for ye learn no more indeed what measure of knowledge soeuer ye haue then ye practice the third dutie in our generall preparation is in this life to enter into the first degree of life eternal for as i haue said there be three degrees of life euerlasting and the first of them is in this present life for hee that would liue in eternall happines for euer must beginne in this world to rise out of the graue of his owne sinnes in which by nature he lies buried and liue in newnesse of life as it is said in the reuelation he that will escape the second death must be made partaker of the first resurrection and paul saith to the colossians that they were in this life deliuered from the power of darkenesse and translated into the kingdom of christ and christ saith to the church of the jew the kingdome of heauen is amongst you now this first degree of life is when a man can say with paul i liue not but christ liues in me that is i finde partly by the testimonie of my sanctified conscience and partly by experirience that christ my redeemer by his spirit guideth and gouerneth my thoughts will affections and all the powers of bodie amp soule according to the blessed direction of his holy will now that we may bee able truely to say this we must haue three gifts and graces of god wherein especially this first degree of life consists the first is sauing knowledge whereby wee do truly resolue our selues that god the father of christ is our father christ his son our redeemer amp the holy ghost our coforter that this knowledge is one part of life eternall it appeares by the saying of christ in john this is life eternall that is the beginning and entrance to life eternall to knowe thee the onely god and whome thou hast sent iesus christ the second grace is peace of conscience which passeth al vnderstanding and therefore paul saith that the kingdome of heauen is righteousnesse peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost the horrour of a guiltie conscience is the beginning of death amp destruction therefore peace of consciece deriued fro the death of christ is life and happinesse the third is the regimet of the spirit whereby the heart and life of ma is ordered according to the word of god for paul saith that they that are the children of god are led by the spirit of christ now seeing this is so that if we would liue eternally we must begin to liue that blessed and eternall life before wee die here we must be carefull to reforme two common errours the first is that a ma enters into eternall life when he dies and not before which is a flatte vntrueth our sauiour christ said to zacheus this day is saluation come to thy house giuing vs to vnderstand that a man the begins to be saued when god doth effectually call him by the ministery of his gospel whosoeuer then will be saued when he is dying amp dead must begin to be saued while he is now liuing his saluation must beginne in this life that would come to saluation after this life verily verily saith christ he that heareth my word and beleeueth in him that sent me hath eternall life namely in this present life the second error is that howsoeuer a man liue if when he is dying he can lift vp his his eies amp say lord haue mercie vpon me he is certainely saued behold a very fond amp foolish conceit that deceiues many a ma it is al one as if an arrand thiefe should thus reason with himselfe and say i will spend my daies in robbing and stealing i feare neither arraignment nor execution for at the very time whe i am to be turned off from the ladder if i doe but call vpon the iudge i know i shall haue my pardon behold a most daungerous and desperate course and the very ame is the practise of carelesse man in the matter of their saluation for a man may die with lord haue mercy in his mouth amp perish eternally except in this world he enter into the first degree of eternall life for not euery one that saith lord lord shall enter into heauen but he that doth the will of the father which is in heauen the fourth dutie is to exercise and inure our selues in dying by little and little so long as we liue here vpon earth before we come to die indeede and as me that are appointed to run a race exercise themselues before in running that they may get the victory so should we begin to die now while wee are liuing that we might dywel in the end but some may say how should this be done paul giues vs direction in his own example when he saith by the reioycing which i haue in christ i die daily and he died daily not onely because he was often in danger of death by reaso of his calling but also because in all his dangers amp troubles hee inured himselfe to die for when man doe make the right vse of their afflictios whether they be in bodie or minde or both and doe with all their might indeauour to beare them patiently humbling themselues as vnder the correction of god then they begin to die wel and to doe this indeede is ro take an excellent course he that would mortifie his greatest sins must begin to do it with small sinnes which when they are once reformed a ma shalbe able more easily to ouercome his master sins so likewise he that would be able to beare the crosse of all crosses namely death it selfe must first of all learne to beare smal crosses as sicknesses in bodie and troubles in minde with losses of goods and of friends and of good name which i may fitly tearme little death amp the beginnings of death it selfe and we must first of all acquaint our selues with these litle death before we can be able to beare the great death of all again the afflictions and calamities of this life are as it were the harbingers and puruiers of death and we are first to learne how to entertaine these messengers that when death the lord himselfe shall come wee may in better manner entertaine him this point bilney the martyr well cosidered who oftentimes before he was burned put his finger into the flame of the candle not onely to make trial of his abilitie in suffering but also to arme and strengthen himself against greater tormets in death thus ye see the fourth duty which ye must in any wise learne and remember because we cannot be able to beare the pangs of death well vnles we be first well schooled and nurtured by sundrie trialls in this life the fifth and last dutie is set downe by salomon all that thine hand shall finde to doe doe it with all thy power and marke the reason for there is neither worke nor inuention nor knowledge nor wisedome in the graue whither thou goest to the same purpose paul saith doe good to all man while ye haue time therfore if any man be able to doe any good seruice either to god church or to the commonwealth or to any priuate man let him doe it with all speede amp with all his might lest death it selfe preuent him he that hath care thus to spend his daies shal with much comfort and peace of conscience end his life thus much of generall preparation now followeth the particular which is in the time of sicknes and here first of all i will shew what is the doctrine of the papists and then afterward the truth by the popish order and practise when a man is about to die he is enioyned three things first to make sacramentall confession specially if it be in any mortall sinne secondly to receiue the eucharist thirdly to require his annoyling that is the sacrament as they call it of extreame vnction sacramentall confession they tearme a rehearsal or enumeration of all mans sinnes to a priest that he may receiue absolution but against this kind of confession sundry reasons may be alleadged first of all it hath no warrant either by commandemet or example in the whole word of god they say yes and they indeauour to prooue it thus he which lies in any mortall sinne is by god law bound to doe penance and to seeke reconciliation with god now the necessary means after baptisme to obtaine reconciliatio is confession of all our sins to a priest because christ hath appointed priests to be iudges vpon earth with such measure of authority that no man falling after baptisme can without their sentece and determination be reconciled and they can not rightly iudge vnlesse they know all a mans sinnes therefore all that fal after baptisme are bound by god word to open all their sins to the priest ans it is false which they say that priests are iudges hauing power to examine and take knowledge of mens sinnes and iurisdiction whereby they can properly absolue amp pardon or retaine the for god word hath giuen no more to man but a ministerie of reconciliation whereby in the name of god and according to his word he doth preach declare and pronounce that god doth pardon or not pardon his sins againe pardon may truly be pronounced amp right iudgement of the estate of any man without a particular rehearsall of all his sinnes for he which soundly amp truly repents of one or some fewe sinnes repents of all secondly this confession is ouerturned by the practise of the prophets amp apostles who not onely absolued particular persons but also whole churches without exaction of an auricular confession when nathan the prophet had rebuked dauid for his two great amp horrible crimes dauid touched with remors said i haue sinned amp natha presetly without further examinatio declared vnto him in the name of god that his sins were forgiuen him thirdly it can not be prooued by any good amp sufficient proofes that this confession was vsed in the church of god til after fiue or sixe hundred yeares were expired for the confession which was then in vse was either publike before the church or the opening of a publike fault to some priuate person in secret therfore to vrge sicke man vnto it lying at the point of death is to lay more burdens on the then euer god appointed and whereas they make it a necessarie thing to receiue the eucharist in the time of sicknes toward death and that priuatly of the sicke partie alone they haue no warrant for their practise and opinion for in the want of the sacrament there is no danger but in the contempt and the very contempt it self is a sin which may be pardoned if wee repent and there is no reason why wee should thinke that sicke man should be depriued of the cofort of the lord supper if they receiue it not in death because the fruit and efficacie of the sacrament once receiued is not to be restrained to the time of receiuing but it extends it self to the whole time of mans life afterward againe the supper of the lord is no priuate action but meerely ecclesiasticall and therfore to be celebrated in the meeting amp assembly of god people as our sauiour christ prescribeth when hee saith do ye this and paul in saying when ye come together but it is alleadged that the israelites did eat the pascal lamb in their houses whe they were in egypt ans the israelites had then no libertie to make any publicke meeting for that end and god commanded that the paschall lamb should be eaten in al the houses of the israelites at one amp the same instant amp that in effect was as much as if it had bin publike againe they alleadge a canon of the councell of nice which decreeth that man being about to die must receiue the eucharist amp not frau dari viatico be depriued of the prouision of food necessarie for their iourney ans the councell made no decree touching the administration of the sacrament to all man that die but to such only as fal away fro the faith in persequution or fell into any other notorious crime and were thereupon excommunicate amp so remained till death amp either then or somewhat before testified their repentance for their offences and the canon was made for this end that such persons might be assured that they were againe receiued into the church amp by this means depart with more cofort thirdly it is obiected that in the primitiue church part of the eucharist was carried by a lad to serapion an aged man lying sicke in his bedde ans it was indeed the custome of the auncient church from the very beginning that the elements of bread and wine should be sent by some of the deacons to the sicke which were absent from the assebly and yet neuerthelesse here is no footing for priuate communions for the eucharist was only then sent when the rest of the church did openly comunicate amp such as were the abset only by reaso of sicknes amp desired to be partakers of that blessed communion were to be reputed as present lastly it is obiected that it was the maner of man amp woman in former times b sil epi ad caes tert lib ad vxor hier in apol pro lib in iob to cary part of the sacramet home to their houses and to reserue it till the time of necessitie as the time of sicknes and such like ans the reseruation of the sacrament was but a superstitious practise though it be ancient for out of the administratio that is before it begin amp after it is ended the sacramet ceaseth to be a sacrament amp the elements to be elements as for the practise of the that vsed to cramme the eucharist into the mouth of them that were diseased it is not onely superstitious but also very aburd as for the annoying of the sicke that is the annointing of the bodie specially the organes or instrumets of the senses that the party may obtain the remission of his sinnes and comfort against all the temptatios of the diuell in the houre of death and stregth more easily to beare the paines of sicknes and the pangs of death and be againe restored to his corporall health if it bee expedient for the saluatio of his soule it is but a dotage of mans braine and hath not so much as a shew of reason to iustifie it the fift of iames is commonly alledged to this purpose but the annointing there mentioned is not of the same kinde with this greasie sacramet of the papists for that anointing of the body was a ceremony vsed by the apostles and others when they put in practise the miraculous gift of healing which gift is now ceased secodly that anointing had a promise that the party annointed should recouer his health but this popish annointing hath no such promise because for the most part the persons thus annointed die afterward without recouerie wheras those which were annointed in the primitiue church alwaies recouered thirdly the ancient annointing serued onely for the procuring of health but this teds further to the procuring of remission of sins and strength in teptation thus hauing seene the doctrine of the papists i come now to speake of the true and right manner of making particular preparation before death which containes three sorts of duties one concerning god the other cocerning a mas own selfe the third concerning our neighbour the first cocerning god is to seeke to be recociled vnto him in christ though we haue bin long assured of his fauour all other duties must come after in the second place amp they are of no effect without this now this recociliatio must be sought for amp is obtained by a renuing of our former faith amp repentance and they must be renued on this maner so soone as a man shal feele any maner of sicknes to seaze vpon his bodie he must consider with himselfe whence it ariseth amp after serious consideration he shall finde that it comes not by chance or fortune but by the prouidence of god this done he must go yet furder amp cosider for what cause the lord should afflict his body with any sicknes or disease and he shal find by god word that sicknes comes ordinarily and vsually of sinne wherefore is the liuing man sorrowfull man suffereth for his sinne it is true indeed ther be other causes of the wats of the body amp of sicknes beside sinne and though they be not known to vs yet they ar known to the lord hereupon christ when he saw a certaine blinde man and was demaunded what was the cause of the blindnesse answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the workes of god should be shewed on him yet we for our parts who are to goe not by the secret but by the reuealed will of god must make this vse of our sicknes that it is sent vnto vs for our sinnes when christ healed the man sicke of the palsy he saith be of good comfort thy sinnes are forgiuen thee and when he had healed the man by the poole of bethesda that had bin sicke yers he bids him sin no more least a worse thing happen vnto him giuing them both to vnderstand that their sicknes came by reaso of their sinnes and thus should euery sick man resolue himself now when we haue proceeded thus farre amp haue as it were laid our finger vpon the right and proper cause of our sicknesse three things cocerning our sins must bee performed of vs in sicknes first we must make a new examination of our hearts and liues amp say as the israelites said in affliction let vs search amp try our waies and turne againe to the lord secondly we must make a new confession to god of our new amp particular sinnes as god sends new corrections and chastisment when dauid had the had of god very heauy vpon him for his sins so as his very bones amp moisture consumed within him he made confession of them vnto god and therupon obtained his pardon amp was healed the third thing is to make new praier amp more earnest then euer before with sighes amp grones of the spirit amp that for pardon of the same sins amp for reconciliation with god in christ in the exercise of these duties standes the renouation of our faith amp repentance wherby they are increased quickned amp reuiued and the more sicknes preuailes and takes place in the bodie the more should wee be careful to put the in vre that spirituall life might increase as temporal life is decaied when king ezechias lay sicke as he thought vpon his death bedde he wept as for some other causes so also for his sinnes and withal he praied god to cast them behind his back dauid made certain psalmes when he was sick or at the least vpon the occasio of his sicknes as namely the the the the ampc and they are al psalmes of repetace in which we may see how in distresse of the body and mind he renewed his faith amp repentace heartily bewailing his sinnes amp intreating the lord for the pardon of them manasses one that fell from god and gaue himselfe to many horrible sins when he was taken captiue and imprisoned in babylon hee prayed to the lord his god and humbled himselfe greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed vnto him and god was intreated of him and heard his prayer and brought him againe to ierusalem into his kingdome and then manasses knew that the lord was god now looke what manasses did in this tribulatio the same thing must we doe in the time of our bodily sicknesse here i haue occasion to mention a notorious fault that is very common in this age euen amog such as haue long liued in the bosome of the church and that is this man now adaies are so far from renuing their faith and repentance that when they lie sick and are drawing toward death they must bee catechised in the doctrine of faith and repentance as if they had beene but of late receiued into the church whosoeuer wil but as occasion is offered visit the sick shall finde this to be true which i say what a shame is this that whe a man hath spent his life amp daies in the church for the space of or or yeares hee should at the very ende of all amp not before begin to enquire what faith amp what repentance is and how his soule might bee saued this one sin argues the great securitie of this age amp the great contempt of god and his word wel let al man hereafter in time to come bee warned to take heede of this exceeding negligence in matters of saluation and to vse all good means before hand that they may be able in sicknesse and in the time of death to put in practise the spirituall exercises of inuocation and repentance now if so be it fall out that the sicke partie cannot of himselfe renue his owne faith and repentance he must seeke the help of others when the man that was sicke of the dead palsie could not go to christ himself he got others to bear him in his bedde amp when they could not come neere for the multitude they vncouered the roofe of the house and let the bed down before christ euen so when sicke man cannot alone by theselues doe the good duties to which they are bound they must borrow helpe from their fellowe members who are partly by their counsell to put to their helping hand amp partly by their prayers to present them vnto god and to bring them into the presence of christ and touching helpe in this case sundry duties are to be performed saint iames sets downe foure two whereof concerne the sicke patient and other two such as be helpers the first duty of the sicke man is to send for helpe where two circumstances must be considered who must be sent for and when for the first s iames saith is any sicke among you let him call for the elders of the church whereby are meant not onely apostles and all ministers of the gospel but others also as i take it which were man ancient for yeares indued with the spirit of vnderstanding and praier and had withall the gift of working miracles and of healing the sicke for in the primitiue church this gift was for a time so plentifully bestowed on the that beleued in christ that souldiers cast out diuels and parents wrought miracles on their childre hece we may learne that howsoeuer it be the dutie of the ministers of the word principally to visit and comfort the sicke yet is it not their duty alone for it belongs to them also which haue knowledge of god word and the gift of prayer exhort one an other saith the holy ghost while it is called to day and againe admonish them that are disordered and comfort those that are weake and indeede in equitie it should be the dutie of euery christian man to cofort his brother in sicknesse here wee must needes take knowledge of the common fault of man and woman when they come to visit their neighbours and friends they can not speake a word of instruction and comfort but spend the time either in silence gazing and looking on or in vttering wordes to little or no purpose saying to the sicke partie that they are sorie to see him in that case that they wold haue him to be of good comfort but wherein and by what meanes they cannot tel that they doubt not but that he shall recouer his health and liue with them still amp be merry as in former time that they will pray for him whereas al their prayers are nothing else but the apostles creede or the ten commandemets amp the lord praier vttered without vnderstanding and this is the common comfort thar sicke man gette at the hands of their neighbours whe they come vnto them and all this comes either because man liue in ignorace of god word or because they falsely thinke that the whole burthen of this dutie lies vpon the shoulders of the minister the second circumstance is when the sicke partie must send for the elders to instruct him and pray for him and that is in the very first place of al before any other helpe be sought for where the diuine endes there the physitian must begin and it is a very preposterous course that the diuine should ther begin where the physitian makes an ende for till help be had for the soule and sinne which is the root of sicknes be cured physicke for the body is nothing therefore it is a thing much to be disliked that in all places almost the physitian is first sent for and comes in the beginning of the sicknes and the minister comes when a man is half dead and is then sent for oftentimes when the sicke partie lies drawing on and gasping for breath as though ministers of the gospel in these daies were able to worke miracles the second dutie of the sick partie is to confesse his sins as s iames saith confesse your sinnes one to another and pray one for another it will be said that this is to bring in againe popish shrift ans confession of our sinnes and that vnto man was neuer denied of any the question only is of the manner and order of making confession and for this cause wee must put a great difference betweene popish shrift and the confession of which s iames speaketh for he requires onely a confession of that or those sinnes which lie vpon a mans conscience when he is sicke but the popish doctrine requireth a particular enumeration of al mans sins again s iames inioynes confessio onely as a thing meete amp conueniet but the papists as a thing necessarie to the remission of sins thirdly s iames permits that confession be made to any man amp by one man to another mutually whereas popish shrift is made onely to the priest the secod duty then is that the sick party troubled in minde with the memory and consideration of any of his sinnes past or any manner of way tempted by the diuell shall freely of his owne accord open his case to such as are both able amp willing to help him that he may receiue comfort and die in peace of conscience thus much of the sick mans duty now follow the duties of helpers the first is to pray ouer him that is in his presence to pray with him and for him and by prayer to present his very person and his whole estate vnto god the prophet elizeus the apostle paul amp our sauiour christ vsed this manner of praying when they would miraculously restore temporall life and therfore it is very meet that the same should be vsed also of vs that we might the better stirre vp our affection in prayer and our compassion to the sicke when we are about to intreat the lord for the remission of their sinnes and for the saluation of their soules the second duty of him that comes as an helper is to annoint the sicke party with oyle now this annointing was an outward ceremony which was vsed with the gift of healing which is now ceased and therefore i omit to speake further of it thus much of the duty which the sick man owes to god now follow the duties which he is to performe vnto himselfe and they are twofold one concernes his soule the other his bodie the dutie concerning his soule is that he must arme amp furnish himself against the immoderate feare of present death and the reason hereof is plaine because howsoeuer naturally man feare death through the whole course of their liues more or lesse yet in the time of sicknesse when death approcheth this naturall feare bred in the bone will most of all shew it selfe euen in such sort as it will astonish the senses of the sicke partie and sometime cause desperation therefore it is necessarie that we shold vse meanes to strengthen our selues against the feare of death the meanes are of two sorts practises and meditations practises are two especially the first is that the sicke man must not so much regard death it self as the benefits of god which are obtained after death he must not fixe his minde vpon the consideration of the pangs and torments of death but all his thoughts and affections must be set vpon that blessed estate that is enioyed after death he that is to passe ouer some great and deepe river must not looke downward to the streame of the water but if he would preuent feare he must set his foote sure amp cast his eye to the banke on the further side amp so must he that drawes neere death as it were look ouer the waues of death and directly fixe the eye of his faith vpon eternall life the second practise is to looke vpon death in the glasse of the gospel and not in the glasse of the law that is we must consider death not as it is propounded in the lawe and looke vpon that terrible face which the law giueth vnto it but as it is set forth in the gospel death in the law is a curse and the downe fall to the pit of destruction in the gospel it is the entrance into heauen the lawsets forth death as death the gospel sets forth death as no death but as a sleepe onely because it speakes of death as it is altered amp changed by the death of christ by the vertue whereof death is properly no death to the servant of god whe man shall haue care on this manner to consider of death it will be a notable meanes to strengthen and stablish them against al immoderate feares amp terrours that vsually rise in sicknesse the meditations which serue for this purpose are innumerable but i wil touch onely those which are the most principall and the grounds of the rest and they are foure in number the first is borrowed from the speciall prouidence of god namely that the death of euery man much more of euery childe of god is not onely foreseene but also foreappointed of god yes the death of euery man deserued and procured by his sins is laid vpon him by god who in that respect may be said to be the cause of euery mans death so saith anna the lord killeth and maketh aliue the church of hierusalem confessed that nothing came to passe in the death of christ but that which the foreknowledge and eternal counsel of god had appointed and therfore the death also of euery member of christ is foreseene and ordained by the speciall decree and prouidence of god i adde further that the very circustances of death as the time when the place where the manner how the beginning of sickenes the continuance amp the end euery fitte in the sicknes amp the pangs of death are particularly set downe in the counsell of god the very haires of our heads are numbred saith our sauiour christ and a sparrowe lights not on the groud without the will of our heauenly father dauid faith excelletly my bones are not hid from thee though i was made in a secret place and fashioned beneath in the earth thine eyes did see me when i was without forme for in thy booke were al things written which in continuance were fashioned whe there was nine of them before and he praies to god to put his teares into his bottle now if this be true that god hath bottles for the very teares of his servant much more hath hee bottles for their blood amp much more doth he respect and regard their paines and miseries with all the circumstances of sicknesse and death the carefull meditation of this one point is a notable meanes to arme vs against feare and distrust amp impatience in the time of death as some examples in this case will easily manifest i held my tongue amp said nothing saith dauid but what was it that caused this patience in him the cause followes in these words because thou lord diddest it and ioseph saith to his brother feare not for it was the lord that sent me before you marke here how ioseph is armed against impatience and griefe amp discontentment by the very consideration of god prouidence and so in the same maner shall we be cofirmed against all feares and sorrowes and say with dauid pretious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints if this perswasion be once setled in our hearts that all things in sicknes amp death come to passe vnto vs by the prouidence of god who turnes all things to the good of them that loue him the second meditation is to be borrowed from the excellent promise that god hath made to the death of the righteous which is blessed are they that die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their workes follow them the author of truth that cannot lie hath spoken it now then let a man but throughly consider this that death ioyned with a reformed life hath a promise of blessednes adioined vnto it and it alone will be a sufficient meanes to stay the rage of our affections and al inordinate feare of death and the rather if we marke wherein this blessednesse consists in death we are indeede thrust out of our olde dwelling places namely these houses of clay amp earthly tabernacles of our body wherein we haue made long abode but what is the ende surely that liuing amp dying in christ we might haue a building giuen of god that is an house not made with hands but eternall in heauen which is vnspeakeable amp immortall glory if a poore man should bee commanded by a prince to put off his torne and beggery garments and in stead thereof to put on royal and costly robes it would bee a great reioycing to his heart oh then what ioyfull newes must this bee vnto all repentant and sorrowfull sinners when the king of heauen and earth comes vnto the by death and bids them lay downe their body as ragged and patched garments and prepare theselues to put on the princely robe of immortalitie no tongue can be able to expresse the excellency of this most blessed and happy estate the third meditation is borrowed from the estate of all the that are in christ whether liuing or dying he that dieth beleeuing in christ dieth not forth of christ but in him hauing both his body and soule really coupled to christ according to the tenour of the couenant of grace and though after death body amp soule be seuered one from another yet neither of the are seuered or disioyned from christ the coniunction which is once begun in this life remaines eternally and therefore though the soule goe from the body amp the body it selfe rot in the graue yet both are still in christ both in the couenant both in the fauour of god as before death amp both shal again be ioined togither the body by the vertu of the former coiunctio being raised to eternall life indeed if this vnio with christ were dissolued as the coiunctio of body amp soule is it might be soe matter of discomfort and feare but the foundation and substance of our mysticall coniunction with christ both in respect of our body and soules enduring for euer must needes be a matter of exceeding ioy and comfort the meditation is that god hath promised his speciall blessed and comfortable presence vnto his servant when they are sicke or dying or any way distressed when thou passest thorough the water i will bee with thee saith the lord and through the flouds that they doe not ouerflowe thee when thou walkest thorough the very fire thou shalt not be burnt neither shall the flame kindle vpon thee now the lord doth manifest his presece three waies the first is by moderating and lessening the paines and torments of sicknes amp death as the very words of the former promise doe plainly import hence it comes to passe that to many man the sorrowes and pangs of death are nothing so grieuous and troublesome as the afflictions amp crosses which are laid on them in the course of their liues the second way of god presence is by an inward amp vnspeakable comfort of the spirit as paul saith we reioyce in tribulations knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience ampc but why is this reioycing because saith he in the next words the loue of god is shedde abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost again paul hauing in some grieuous sicknes receiued the sentence of death saith of himself that as the sufferings of christ did abound in him so his consolation did abound through christ here then we see that whe earthly comforts faile the lord himselfe drawes neere the bed of the sicke as it were visiting them in his own person amp ministring vnto them refreshing for their soules with his right had he holds vp their heads and with his left hand he embraceth them the third meanes of god presece is the ministery of his good angels whome the lord hath appointed as keepers and nources vnto his servant to hold the vp and to beare them in their armes as nources doe young children and to be as a guard vnto them against the diuel and his angels and al this is verified specially in sicknesse at which time the holy angels are not only preset with such as feare god but ready also to receiue and to carry their soules into heauen as appeares by the example of lazarus and thus much of the first dutie which a sicke man is to perform vnto himself namely that he must by all meanes possible arme and strengthen himselfe against the feare of death now followeth the secod duty which is concerning the body and that is that all sicke persons must be careful to preserue health amp life till god doe wholly take it away for paul saith none of vs liueth to himselfe neither doth any die to himselfe for whether we liue we liue vnto the lord or whether we die we die vnto the lord whether we liue therefore or die we are the lord for this cause we may not doe with our liues as we will but we must reserue the whole disposition therof vnto god for whose glory we are to liue and die and this temporall life is a most pretious iewell and as the common saying is life is very sweet because it is giuen to man for this end that he might haue some space of time wherein he might vse all good meanes to attaine to life euerlasting life is not bestowed on vs that wee should spend our daies in our lusts amp vaine pleasures but that we might haue libertie to come out of the kingdome of darkenes into the kingdome of grace and from the bondage of sinne into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of god amp in this respect speciall care must be had of preseruation of life till god do call vs hence in the preseruation of life things must bee considered the meanes and the right vse of the meanes the meanes is good amp wholesome physicke which though it be despised of many as a thing vnprofitable amp needles yet must it be esteemed as an ordinance and blessing of god this appeares because the spirit of god hath giuen approbation vnto it in the scriptures when it was the good pleasure of god to restore life vnto king ezekias a lumpe of drie figges by the prophets appointment was laid to his boyle and he was healed indeede this cure was in some sort miraculous because he was made whole in the space of or daies and the third day he went vp to the temple yet the bunch of figs was a naturall or ordinarie medicine or plaister seruing to soften and ripen tumours or swellings in the flesh and the samaritane is commended for the binding vp and for the powring in of wine and oile into the woundes of the man that lay wounded betweene ierusalem and iericho now this dealing of his was a right practise of physicke for the wine serued to cleanse the wound and to ease the paine within and oile serued to supple the flesh and to asswage the paine without and the prophet esay seemes to comend this physicke when he saith from the sole of the foote there is nothing whole therein but unds and swellings and sores full of corruption they haue not beene wrapped nor bound vp nor mollified with oyle and whereas god did not command circumcision of childre before the eight day he followed a rule of physicke obserued in all ages that the life of the child is very vncerten till the first seauen daies be expired as we may see by the example of the childe which dauid had by bathsheba which died the seaueth day and vpon the very same ground heathen man vsed not to name their children before the eight day thus then it is manifest that the vse of physick is lawful and commendable furthermore that physick may be well applied to the mainetenance of health speciall care must be had to make choice of such physitions as are knowne to be well learned and man of experience as also of good conscience and good religion for as in other callings so in this also there be sundry abuses which may endanger the liues and the health of man some venter vpon the bare inspection of the vrine without further directio or knowledge of the estate of the sicke to prescribe and minister as shall seeme best vnto the but the learned in this faculty plainly a vouch that this kind of dealing tendes rather to kill then to cure and that sundry man are indeed killed thereby for iudgment by the vrine is most deceitfull the water of him that is sicke of a pestilent feauer euen vnto death looks for substance and colour as the water of a whole man and so doth the water of them that are sicke of a quartane or of any other intermitting feauer specially if they haue vsed a good dyet from the beginning as also of them that haue the pleuresie or the inflammatio of the lungs or the squinancie oftentimes when they are neare death now then considering the water of such as are at the point of death appeare as the vrines of haile and sound man one and the same vrine may foresignifie both life and death and be a signe of diverse nay of contrarie diseases a thinne crude and pale vrine in them that be in health is a toke of want of digestion but in them that are sicke of a sharpe or burning ague it betokens the frensie amp is a certen signe of death againe others there bee that thinke it a small matter to make experiments of their deuised medicines vpon the body of their patients wherby the health which they hoped for is either hindered or much decayed thirdly there be others which minister no physick at any time or vse phlebotomie without the direction of iudiciall astrologie but if they shall follow this course alwaies they must needs kill many a man put the case that a man full bodied is taken with a pleurisie the moone being in l one what must be done the learned in this article say he must presently be let blood but by astrologie a stay must be made till the moone be remooued from leo to the house of the sun but by that time the impostume wil be so much encreased by the gathering togither of the humors that it can neither be dissolued nor ripened and by this meanes the sicke partie wanting helpe in time shall die either by inflammation or by the consumption of the lungs againe when a man is sicke of the squinancie or of the feauer called synaichus the moone then being in malignant aspects with any of the infortunate planets as astrologers vse to speake if letting of blood be deferred till the moone be freed from the foresaid aspects the partie dies in the meane season therefore they are farre wide that minister purgations and let blood no otherwise then they are counselled by the constitution of the starres whereas it is a farre better course to consider the matter of the disease with the disposition amp ripening of it as also the courses and simptomes and crisis thereof this beeing so there is good cause that sicke man should as well be carefull to make choise of meete phisitians to whom they might commend the care of their health as they are carefull to make choise of lawyer for their worldly suites and diuines for cases of conscience furthermore all man must here be warned to take heede that they vse not such meanes as haue no warrant of this kinde are all charmes or spels of what words soeuer they consist characters and figures either in paper wood or waxe all amulets and ligatures which serue to hang about the necke or other parts of the bodie except they be grounded vpon some good naturall reason as white peonie hung about the necke is good against the falling sicknes and woolfe dung tied to the bodie is good against the cholicke not by any inchantment but by inward vertue otherwise they are all vaine and superstitious because neither by creation nor by any ordinace in god word haue they any power to cure a bodily disease for words can doe no more but signifie and figures can doe no more but represent and yet neuerthelesse these unlawful and absurde meanes are more vsed amp sought for of common people then good physicke but it stands all man greatly in hand in no wise to seeke forth to inchanters and sorcerers which indeede are but witches and wizzards though they are commonly called cunning or wise man and woman it were better for a man to die of his sicknes then to seeke recouery by such wicked persons for if any turne after such as worke with spirits and after soothsayers to goe an whoring after them the lord will set his face against them and cut them off from among his people when ahazia was sicke he sent to baalzebub to the god of ekron to know whether he should recouer or no as the messengers were going the prophet elijah met them and saide goe and returne to the king which sent you and say vnto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is no god in israel that thou sendest to inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come downe from thy bed on which thog article gone vp but shalt die the death therefore such kinde of helpe is so farre from curing any paine or sicknes that it rather doubleth them and fasteneth them vpon vs thus much of the meanes of health now followes the maner of vsing the meanes concerning which three rules must be followed first of all he that is to take physicke must not onely prepare his body as physitians doe prescribe but he must also prepare his soule by humbling himselfe vnder the hand of god in his sicknesse for his sinnes and make earnest praier to god for the pardon of them before any medicine come in his body nowe that this order ought to be vsed appeares plainely in this that sicknes springs from our sinnes as from a root which should first of all be stocked vp that the braunches might more easily die and therefore afa commended for many other things is blamed for this by the holy ghost that he sought not to the lord but to the physitians amp put his trust in them oftentimes it comes to passe that diseases curable in themselues are made incurable by the sins and the impenitecie of the partie and therefore the best way is for them that would haue ease whe god begins to correct them by sicknes then also to begin to humble themselues for all their sinnes and turne vnto god the second rule is that when we haue prepared our selues and are about to vse physicke we must sanctifie it by the word of god and praier as we do our meate and drinke for by the word we must haue our warrant that the medicines prescribed are lawful and good and by praier wee must intreate the lord for a blessing vpon them in restoring of health if it be the good will of god the third rule is that wee must carrie in mind the right amp proper ende of physicke least we deceiue our selues we must not therefore thinke that physicke serues to preuent olde age or death it selfe for that is not possible because god hath set downe that all man shal die and be changed and life consists in a temperature and proportion of natural heat and radical moisture which moisture beeing once consumed by the former heat is by arte vnrepairable and therefore death must needs follow but the true ende of physicke is to continue and lengthen the life of man to his naturall period which is when nature that hath bin long preserued by all possible meanes is now wholly spent now this period though it can not be lengthened by any skill of man yet may it easily be shortned by intemperance in diet by intercu aneus carni fex drunkennes and by violent diseases but care must be had to auoide al such euils that the little lamp of corporall life may burne till it goe out of it selfe for this very space of time is the very day of grace and saluation amp whereas god in iustice might haue cut vs off and haue vtterly destroyed vs yet in great mercie he giues vs thus much time that we might prepare our selues to his kingdome which time when it is once spent if a man would redeeme it with the price of ten thousand worlds he cannot haue it and to conclude this point touching physicke i will here set downe two especiall duties of the physitian himselfe the first is that in the want and defect of such as are to put sicke man in minde of their sinnes it is a duty specially concerning him he being a member of christ to aduertise his parties that they must truely humble themselues and pray feruently to god for the pardon of all their sinnes and surely this dutie would be more commonly practised then it is if all physitians did consider that oftentimes they want good successe in their dealings not because there is any want in arte or good will but because the partie with whome they deale is impenitent the second duty is when he sees manifest signes of death in his patient not to depart concealing them but first of all to certifie the patient therof there may bee and is too much nicenes in such concealements and the plaine truth in this case knowne is very profitable for when the partie is certen of his end it bereaues him of all confidence in earthly things amp makes him put all his affiance in the meere mercie of god when ezechias was sicke the prophet speakes plainely to him and saith set thine house in order for thou must die and what good wee may reape by knowing certainly that we haue receiued the sentence of death paul sheweth when he saith we receiued the sentence of death in our selues because we should not trust in our selues but in god that raiseth the dead hauing thus seene what bee the duties of the sicke man to himselfe let vs now see what bee the duties which hee oweth to his neighbour and they are two the first is the dutie of reconciliation whereby hee is freely to forgiue all man and to desire to be forgiuen of all in the olde testament when a man was to offer a bullocke or lambe in sacrifice to god he must leaue his offer at the altar and first go and bee reconciled to his brother if they had ought against him much more then must this be done when we are in death to offer vp our selues our body and soules as an acceptable sacrifice vnto god question what if a man cannot come to the speech of them with whome he would be reconciled or if he doe what if they will not be reconciled answer when any shall in their sicknesse seeke and desire reconciliation and cannot obtaine it either because the parties are absent or because they will not relent they haue discharged their conscience and god will accept their will for the deede as put case a man lying sicke on his death bedde is at enmitie with one that is beyond the sea so as he cannot possibly haue any speech with him if he would neuer so faine how shall he stay his minde why he must remember that in this case a will and desire to be reconciled is reconciliation it selfe the second duty is that those which are rulers amp gouernours of others must haue care amp take order that their charges committed to them by god be left in good estate after their death amp here come three duties to be handled the first of the magistrate the second of the minister the third of the master of the family the magistrates duty is before he die to prouide as much as he can for the godly amp peaceable estate of the towne citie or common wealth and that is done partly by procuring the maintenance of sound religion and vertue and partly by establishing of the execution of ciuil iustice and outward peace examples of the practise in god word are these whe moses was an hundred and twentie yeare old and was no more able to go in and out before the people of israel he called them before him and signified that the time of his departure was at hand and thereupon tooke order for their wel fare after his death and first of all he placed iosua ouer the in his stead to be their guid to the promised land secondly he giues special charge to all the people to be valiant amp couragious against their enemy and to obey the commandements of god and iosua followes the same course for he calls the people togither amp tells the that the time of his death is at hand amp giues them a charge to be couragious and to worship the true god which done hee endes his daies as a worthy captaine when king dauid was to goe the way of all flesh and lay sicke on his death bed he placed his owne son salomon vpon his throne and gaue him charge both for maintenance of religion and exequution of iustice the duty of ministers when they are dying is as much as they can to cast and prouide for the continuance of the good estate of the church ouer which they are placed consider the example of peter i will saith he indeauour alwaies that yee also may be able to haue remembrance of these things after my departure if this had bin wel obserued there could not haue bin such aboundance of schismes errours and heresies as hath beene and the church of god could not haue suffered so great hauocke but because me haue had more care to maintaine personal successio then the right succession which standes in the doctrine of the prophets and apostles therefore wolues haue come into the roomes of faithfull teachers amp the apostasie of which paul speaks hath ouerspread the face of the church thirdly housholders must set their families in order before they die as the prophet esay saieth to ezechiah set thine house in order for thou must die for the procuring of good order in the family after death two things are to bee done the first concernes this life and that is to dispose of landes and goods and that this may be well and wisely done if the will be vnmade it is with godly aduise and counsell to be made in the time of sicknesse according to the practise of auncient amp worthy me abraha before his death makes his will amp giues legacies so did isaac and iacob in whose last will and testament are contained many worthy blessings and prophesies of the estate of his childre and christ our sauiour when he was vpon the crosse prouided for his mother specially commending her to his disciple john whom hee loued and indeede this dutie of making a will is a matter of great weight and importance for it cuts off much hatred and contention in families and it staies many suites in lawe it is not therefore alwaies a matter of indifferencie which may be done or not done as many falsely thinke who vpon blinde and sinister respects abstaine from making wils either because their wealth should not bee knowne or because they would haue their decaied estate to be concealed or because they feare they shall die the sooner if the will be once made now though the making of wils belong to another place and professio yet so much may be spoken here as the holy ghost hath vttered in the word and that i wil reduce to certaine rules the first is that the will must be made according to the law of nature and the written word of god and the good and wholesome positiue lawes of that kingdom or cuntry wherof a man is a member the will of god must be the rule of mans will and therefore the will that is made against any of these is faultie the second is that if goods euill gotten be not restored before they must euen then be restored by will or by some other way it is the practise of couetous me to bequeath their soules when they die to god amp withall to bequeath their goods euill gotten to their children amp friends which in all equitie should bee restored to them to whom they belong quest howe if a mans conscience tell him that his goods be euill gotten and he knowes not where or to whome to make restitution ans the case is common amp the answer is this when he is known whom thou hast wronged restore to him particularly if the partie be vnknown or dead restore to his executors or assignes or to his next kin if there be none yet keepe not goods euill gotten to thy selfe but restore to god that is in way of recompence and ciuil satisfaction bestow them on the church or common wealth the third rule is that heads of families must principally bestowe their goods on their owne children and them that be of their kindred this man saith god to abraham of eleazar a straunger shall not be thine heire but the son which shal come of thy loynes and this was god commaundemet to the israelites that when any man dies his son should be his heire amp if he haue no son then his daughter amp if he haue no daughter then his brother and if he haue no brother then his fathers brother and if that there be none then the next of the kinne whosoeuer and paul saith if ye be sonnes then also heires and againe he that prouides not for his owne and namely for them of his houshold is worse then an infidell therefore it is a fault of any man to alienate his goods or lands wholly amp finally from his blood and posteritie it is a thing which the very law of nature it selfe hath condemned againe it is a fault to giue all to the eldest and nothing in respect to the rest as though the eldest were borne to be gentlemen amp yonger brother borne to beare the wallet yet in equitie the eldest must haue more then any euen because he is the eldest amp because stocks and families in their persons are to be maintained and because there must alwaies be some that must be fitte to doe speciall seruice in the peace of the common weale or in the time of war which could not be if goods should be equally parted to al the fourth and last rule is that no will is of force till the testatour be dead for so long as he is aliue he may alter and change it these rules must be remembred because they are recorded in scripture the opening of other points amp circumstances belongeth to the profession of the law the second dutie of the master of the familie concerneth the soules of such as be vnder his gouernment and that is to giue charge to them that they learne beleeue and obey the true religion that is the doctrine of saluation set downe in the writings of the prophets amp apostles the lord himselfe comends abraham for this i knowe abraham saith he that he will command his sonnes and his houshold after him that they keepe the way of the lord to doe righteousnes and iudgement and dauid giues salomon on his death bed a most notable amp solemne charge the summe and substance whereof is to know the god of his fathers and to serue him which beeing done he further commends him to god by prayer for which purpose the psalm was made this practise of his is to be followed of all thus gouernours when they shall carefully dispose of their goods and giue charge to their posteritie touching the worship of god shall greatly honour god dying as well as liuing hitherto i haue intreated of the two fold preparatio which is to goe before death now follows the second part of dying well namely the disposition in death this disposition is nothing els but a religious and holy behauiour specially towards god when we are in or neare the agonie and pang of death this behauiour containes three speciall duties the first is to die in or by faith to die by faith is whe a man in the time of death doth with all his heart rely himselfe wholly on god speciall loue and fauoure and mercie in christ as it is reuealed in the word and though there be no part of mans life void of iust occasions whereby we may put faith in practise yet the speciall time of all is the pang of death when friends and riches and pleasures and the outward senses amp temporall life amp all earthly helpes forsake vs for then true faith maketh vs to go wholly out of our selues and to despaire of comfort and saluation in respect of an earthly thing amp with all the power amp strength of the heart to rest on the pure mercie of god this made luther both thinke and say that man were best christians in death an example of this faith we haue in dauid who when he sawe nothing before his eies but present death the people intending to stone him comforted him at that very instant as the text saith in the lord his god and this comfort he reaped in that by faith he applied vnto his own soule the mercifull promises of god as he testifieth of himselfe remember saith he the promise made to thy servant wherein thou hast caused me to trust it is my comfort in trouble for thy promise hath quickned me againe my flesh failed and my heart also but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for euer now looke what dauid here did the same must euery one of vs do in the like case when the israelites in the wildernes were stung with fierie serpents and lay at the point of death they looked vp to the brasen serpent which was erected by the appointment of god and were presently healed euen so when any man feeles death to drawe neere amp his fierie sting to pierce the heart he must fixe the eye of a true and liuely faith vpon christ exalted and crucified on the crosse which beeing done he shal by death enter into eternall life now because true faith is no dead thing it must be expressed by especiall actions the principall whereof is inuocation wherby either praier or thanksgiuing is directed vnto god when death had seazed vpon the body of iacob he raised vp himselfe and turning his face towards the beddes head leaned on the toppe of his staffe by reason of his feeblenes and praied vnto god which praier of his was an excellent fruite of his faith iobs wife in the middest of his affliction said vnto him to very good purpose blesse god and die i knowe and graunt that the words are commonly translated otherwise curse god and die but as i take it the former is the best for it is not like that in so excellent a familie any one person much lesse a matrone and principall gouernour thereof would giue such lewde and wretched councell which the most wicked man vpon earth hauing no more but the light of nature would not once giue but rather much abhorre and condemne and though iob call her a foolish woman yet he doth it not because shee went about to perswade him to blaspheme god but because shee was of the minde of iobs friends and doest thou continue yet in thine vp sightnes v thought that he stood to much in a conceit of his owne righteousnes now the effect amp meaning of her councell is this blesse god that is husband no doubt thou article by the extremitie of thine affliction at death doore therefore begin now at length to lay aside the great ouerweening which thou hast of thine owne righteousnesse acknowledge the hand of god vpon thee for thy sins confesse them vnto him giuing him the glorie pray for the pardon of them amp ende thy daies this counsell is very good and to bee followed of all though it may be the applying of it as iob well perceiued is mixt with follie here it may be alleadged that in the pangs of death man want their senses and conuenient vtterance and therefore that they are vnable to pray ans the very sighes sobs and grones of a repentant and beleeuing heart are praiers before god euen as effectuall as if they were vttered by the best voice in the world praier stands in the affection of the heart the voice is but an outward messenger therof god lookes not vpon the speech but vpon the heart dauid saith god heares the desire of the poore againe that he will fulfill the desires of them that heare him yes their very teares are loud and sounding praiers in his eares againe faith may otherwise be expressed by the last wordes which for the most part of them that haue truly serued god are very excellent and comfortable and full of grace some choise examples whereof i will rehearse for instructions sake and for imitation the last words of iacob were those whereby as a prophet he foretolde blessing and curses vpon his children and the principall among the rest were these the scepter shall not depart from iuda and the lawgiuer from betweene his feete till shilo come and o lord i haue waited for thy saluation the last wordes of moses are his most excellent song set downe deut chap and the last words of dauid were these the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue the god of israel spake to me the strength of israel said beare rule ouer man ampc the words of zacharias the son of iehoida when he was stoned were the lord looke vpon it and require it the last words of our sauiour christ when he was dying vpon the crosse are most admirable and stored with aboundance of spiritual grace to his father he saith father forgiue them they know not what they doe to the thiefe verily i say vnto thee this night shalt thou be with mee in paradise to his mother mother behold thy son and to john behold my mother and in his agonie my god thy god why hast thou forsaken mee and earnestly desiring our saluation i thirst and when he had made perfect satisfaction it is finished and when bodie and soule were parting father into thy hands i commend my spirit the last words of steuen were behold i see the heauens open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god lord iesus receiue my spirit lord lay not this sinne to their charge of polycarpe thou article a true god without lying therefore in all things i praise thee and blesse thee and glorifie thee by the eternall god amp high priest iesus christ thine onely beloued son by whome and with whome to thee and the holy spirit be all glorie now and for euer of ignatius i care not what kinde of death i die i am the bread of the lord and must be grounde with the teeth of lyons that i may be cleane bread for christ who is the bread of life for mee of ambrose i haue not so led my life among you as if i were ashamed to liue neither doe i feare death because we haue a good lord of augustine he is no great man that thinkes it a great matter that trees and stones fall and mortall man die iust article thou o lord amp righteous is thy iudgement of bernard an admonition to his brother that they would grounde the anchor of their faith and hope in the safe and sure port of god mercie because saith he as i suppose i cannot leaue vnto you any choise examples of religion i commend three to be imitated of you which i remember that i haue obserued in the race which i haue run as much as possibly i could i gaue lesse heed to mine own sense amp reason then to the sense and reason of other man when i was hurt i sought not reuenge on him that did the hurt i had care to giue offence to no man and if it fell out otherwise i tooke it away as i could of zwinglius when in the field he was wounded vnder the chin with a speare o what hap is this go to they may kill my bodie but my soule they cannot of oecolampadius an exhortation to the ministers of the church to maintaine the puritie of doctrine to shewe forth an example of honest and godly conuersation to be constant amp patiet vnder the crosse of himselfe whereas i am charged to be a corrupter of the truth i weigh it not now i am going to the tribunall of christ and that with good conscience by the grace of god and there it shall bee manifest that i haue not seduced the church of this my saying amp contestatio i leaue you as witnesses and i confirme it with this my last breath to his children loue god the father amp turning himself to his kinsfolks i haue boud you saith he with this contestation you which they heare and haue desired shall doe your indeauour that these my children may be godly and peaceable and true to his friend comming vnto him what shall i say vnto you newes i shall be shortly with christ my lord beeing asked whether the light did not trouble him touching his breast there is light enough saith he he rehearsed the whole one amp fiftie psalme with deepe sighes fro the bottome of his breast a litle after saue me lord iesus of luther my heauenly father god and father of our lord iesus christ amp god of all comfort i giue thee thanks that thou hast reuealed vnto me thy son iesus christ whom i haue beleeued whom i haue professed whome i haue loued whome i haue praised whome the bishop of rome and the whole company of the wicked persecuteth and reuileth i pray thee my lord iesus christ receiue my poore soule my heauenly father though i be taken from this life and this bodie of mine is to be laid downe yet i know certely that i shall remaine with thee for euer neither shall any be able to pull me out of thy hand of hooper o lord iesus son of dauid haue mercie on me and receiue my soule of annas burgius forsake me not o lord least i forsake thee of melancthon if it be the will of god i am willing to die and i beg him that he will graunt me a ioyfull departure of calvine i held my tongue because thou lord hast done it i mourned as a doue lord thou grindest me to powder but it suffi ceth me because it is thy hand of peter martyr that his body was weake but his minde was well that hee acknowledged no life or saluation but only in christ who was giuen of the father to bee a redeemer of mankinde and when hee had confirmed this by testimonie of scripture he added this is my faith in which i will die and god will destroy them that teach otherwise this done he shooke hads with all and said farewell my brother and deare friends it were easie to quote more examples but these fewe may bee in stead of many amp the summe of al that godlyme speake in death is this some enlightned with a prophetical spirit foretell things to come as the patriarkes iacob and ioseph did and there haue bin some which by name haue testified who should very shortly came after them and who should remaine aliue and what should be their condition some haue shewed a wonderfull memorie of things past as of their former life and of the benefits of god amp no doubt it was giuen them to stirre vp holy affections and thanksgiuing to god some againe rightly iudging of the change of their present estate for a better doe reioyce exceedingly that they must be translated from earth to paradise as babylas martyr of antioch when his head was to be chopped off returne saith he o my soule vnto thy rest because the lord hath blessed thee because thou hast deliuered my soule from death mine eies from teares and my feete fro falling i shall walke before iehoua in the land of the liuing and some others spake of the vanity of this life of the imaginatio of the sorrowes of death of the beginnings of eternall life of the comfort of the holy ghost which they feele of their departure vnto christ quest what must we thinke if in the time of death such excellent speeches bewanting and in stead thereof idle talke be vsed answer we must consider the kinde of sicknesse whereof me die whether it be more easie or violent for violent sicknesse is vsually accompanied with frensies and with vnseemely motions and gestures which we are to take in good part euen in this regard because we our selues may be in the like case thus much of the first duty which is to die in faith the second is to die in obedience otherwise our death cannot be acceptable to god because wee seeme to come vnto god of feare and constraint as slaues to a master and not of loue as children to a father now to die in obedience is when a man is willing amp readie and desirous to goe out of this world whensoeuer god shall call him and that without murmuring or repining at what time where and when it shall please god whether we liue or die saith paul we doe it not to our selues but vnto god and therefore mans dutie is to be obedient to god in death as in life christ is our example in this case who in his agonie praied father let this cup passe fro me yet with a submission not my will but thy will be done teaching vs in the very pangs of death to resigne our selues to the good pleasure of god when the prophet tolde king ezechias of death presently without all manner of grudging or repining hee addressed himselfe to praier we are commanded to present our selues vnto god as freewill offerings without any limitation of time and therefore as well in death as in life i conclude then that we are to make as much conscience in performing obedience to god in suffering death as wee doe of any conscience in the course of our liues the third dutie is to render vp our soules into the handes of god as the most faithfull keeper of all this is the last duty of a christian and it is prescribed vnto vs in the example of christ vpon the crosse who in the very pangs of death when the dissolution of bodie amp soule drewe on said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and so gaue vp the ghost the like was done by steuen who when he was stoned to death said lord iesus receiue my spirit and dauid in his life time beeing in daunger of death vsed the very same words that christ vttered thus we see what be the duties which we are to perform in the very pangs of death that we may come to eternall life some man will happily say if this be all to die in faith and obedience and to surrender our soules into god hands we will not greatly care for any preparatio beforehand nor trouble our selues much about the right manner of dying well for we doubt not but that when death shall come we shall be able to performe all the former duties with ease answer let no man deceiue himselfe by any false perswasio thinking with himselfe that the practise of the foresaid duties is a matter of ease for ordinarily they are not neither can bee performed in death vnles there be much preparation in the life before hee that will die in faith must first of all liue by faith and there is but one example in all the whole bible of a man dying in faith that liued without faith namely the thiefe vpon the crosse the servant of god that are indued with great measure of grace do very hardly beleeue in the time of affliction indeed when iob was afflicted hee said though the lord kill me yet will i trust in him yet afterward his faith beeing ouercast as with a cloude he saith that god was become his enemy amp that he had set him as a marke to shoote at amp sundrie times his faith was oppressed with doubting and distrust how then shall they that neuer liued by faith nor inured themselues to beleeue bee able in the pang of death to rest vpon the mercie of god againe he that would die in obedience must first of all leade his life in obedience hee that hath liued in disobedience can not willingly and in obedience appeare before the iudge when hee is cited by death the sergeant of the lord he dies indeed but that is vpon necessitie because he must yeeld to the order and course of nature as other creatures doe thirdly hee that would surrender his soule into the hands of god must bee resolued of two things the one is that god can the other is that god will receiue his soule into heauen and there preserue it till the last iudgement and none can be resolued of this except he haue the spirit of god to certifie his conscience that he is redeemed iustified sanctified by christ and shall bee glorified hee that is not thus perswaded dare not render vp and present his soule vnto god when dauid said lord into thy handes i commend my spirit what was the reason of this boldnesse in him surely nothing else but the perswasion of faith as the next wordes import for thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth and thus it is manifest that no man ordinarily can performe these duties dying that hath not performed them liuing this beeing so i doe againe renew my former exhortation beseeching you that ye would practise the duties of preparation in the course of your liues leading them daily in faith and obedience and from time to time commending your selues into the hand of god and casting all your workes vpon his prouidence they which haue done this haue made most happie and blessed endes enoch by faith walked with god as one that was alwaies in his presence leading an vpright and godly life and the lord tooke him away that he should not see death and this which befell enoch shall after a sort befall them also that liue in faith and obedience because death shal be no death but a sleepe vnto them and no enemie but a friend to bodie and soule on the contrary let vs consider the wretched amp miserable endes of them that haue spent their daies in their sinnes without keeping faith amp a good conscience the people of the old world were drowned in the flood the filthy sodomites and gomorrheans were destroyed with fire from heauen dathan and abiram with the company of core were swallowed vp of the earth core himselfe as it seemes by the text being burnt with fire wicked saul and achitophel and iudas destroy themselues herod is eaten vp of wormes and gaue vp the ghost iulian the apostata smitten with a dart in the field died casting vp his blood into the ayre amp blaspheming the name of christ arius the hereticke died vpon the stoole scouring forth his very entralls and this very age affoards store of like examples hoffemeister a great papist as he was going to the councill of ralisbone to dispute against the defeders of the gospel was suddenly in his iourney preuented by the hand of god and miserably died with horrible roaring and crying out in the vniuersitie of louaine guarlacus a learned papist falling sicke when he perceiued no way with him but death he fell into miserable agonie and perturbation of spirit crying out of his sinnes how miserably he had liued and that hee was not able to abide the iudgement of god amp so casting out words of miserable desperation saide his sins were greater then they could be pardoned and in that desperation ended his daies iacobus latromus of the same vniuersitie of louaine after that he had beene at bruxels and there thinking to doe a great acte against luther and his fellowes made an oration before the emperour so foolishly and ridiculously that he was laughed to scorne almost of the whole court then returning fro thence to louaine againe in his publike lecture he fell into open madnesse vttering such wordes of desperatio and blasphemous impietie that other diuines which were present were faine to carie him away as he was rauing and to shut him into a close chamber from that time to his very last breath he had neuer any thing else in his mouth but that he was damned and reiected of god and that there was no hope of saluation for him because that wittingly and against his knowledge he withstood the manifest truth of god word crescentius the popes legat and vicegerent in the councell of trent was sitting all the day long vntill darke night in writing of letters to the pope after his labour when night was come thinking to refresh himselfe he began to rise and at his rising behold there appeared to him a mightie blacke dogge of an huge bignesse his eyes flaming with fire amp his eares hanging low downe well neare to the grounde which beganne to enter in and straight to come towardes him and so to couch vnder the boord the cardinall not a little amazed at the sight thereof somewhat recouering himselfe called immediately to his servant which were in the outward chamber next by to bring in a candle and to seeke for the dogge but when the dogge could not be found there nor in any other chamber about the cardinall thereupon stricken with a sudden conceit of minde immediately fel into such a sicknesse whereof his physitians which he had about him could not with all their industrie and cunning cure him and thereupon he died steuen gardiner when a certaine bishop came vnto him and put him in minde of peter denying his master answered againe that he had denied with peter but neuer repented with peter and so to vse m foxes words stinkingly and vnrepentantly died more examples might be added but these shall suffice againe that we may be further induced to the practise of these duties let vs call to minde the vncertentie of our daies though we now liue yet who can say that he shall be aliue the next day or the next houre no man hath a lease of his life now marke as death leaues a man so shall the last iudgement finde him and therefore if death take him away vnprepared eternall damnation followes without recouerie if a thiefe be brought from prison either to the barre to bee arraigned before the iudge or to the place of execution he will bewaile his misdemeanour past and promise all reformation of life so be it he might be deliuered though he be the most arrant thiefe that euer was in this case we are as fellons or theeues for we are euery day going to the barre of god iudgement there is no stay or standing in the way euen as the ship in the sea continues on his course day amp night whether the marriners be sleeping or waking therefore let vs all prepare our selues and amende our liues betime that in death wee may make a blessed ende ministers of the gospel doe daily call for the performance of this dutie but where almost shal we finde the practise amp obedience of it in mens liues amp conuersations alas alas to lend our eares for the space of an houre to heare the will of god is common but to giue heart amp hand to doe the same is rare and the reason hereof is athad we are al most grieuous sinners amp euery sinner in the tearmes of scripture is a foole and a principall part of his folly is to care for the things of this world and to neglect the kingdome of heauen to prouide for the body amp not for the soule to cast and fore cast howe we may liue in wealth and honour and ease and not to vse the least fore cast to die well this folly our sauiour christ noted in the rich man that was carefull to inlarge his barnes but had no care at all for his ende or for the saluation of his soule such a one was achitophel who as the scripture tearmes him was as the very oracle of god for councell being a ma of great wisedome amp forecast in the matters of the comon wealth and in his owne priuate worldly affaires and yet for all this he had not so much as common sense and reason to consider howe he might die the death of the righteous amp come to life euerlasting and this folly the holy ghost hath noted in him for the text saith when he saw that his counsell was despised he sadled his asse and arose amp went home into his cittie and put his houshold in order and went and hanged himselfe and the fiue foolish virgin contented themselues with the blasing lamps of a bare profession neuer seeking for the horne of lasting oyle of true and liuely faith that might furnish and trimme the lampe both in life and death but let vs in the feare of god cast off this damnable folly first of all seeking the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse and leading our liues in faith and obedience that we may die accordingly and thus much of the first point of doctrine namely that there is a certen way whereby a man may die well now i come to the second whereas therefore salomon saith that the day of death is better then the day of birth we are furder taught that such as truly beleeue themselues to be the children of god are not to feare death ouermuch i say ouermuch because they must partly feare it and partly not feare it they must for two causes the first because death is the destructio of humane nature in a mans owne selfe amp others and in this respect christ feared it without sinne and we must not feare it otherwise then we feare sicknes and pouertie and famine with other sorrows of body and minde which god will not haue vs to despise or lightly to regard but to feele with some paine because they are corrections amp punishments for sinne and he doth therfore lay vpon vs paines amp torments that they may be feared and eschewed and that by eschewing them we might further learne to eschewe the cause of them which is sin and by experience in feeling of paine acknowledge that god is a iudge and enemie of sinne and is exceeding angrie with it the second cause of the feare of death is the losse of the church or commonwealth when we or others are depriued of them which were indeede or might haue beene an helpe stay amp comfort to either of them and whose death hath procured some publike or priuate losse againe we are not to feare death but to be glad of it and that for many causes first of al in it we haue occasion to shewe our subiection and obedience which we owe vnto god when he cals vs out of this world as christ said father not my will but thy will be done secondly all sinne is abolished by death and we the cease to offend god any more as we haue done thirdly the dead body is brought into a better condition then euer it was in this life for by death it is made insensible and by that meanes it is freed from all the miseries and calamities of this life amp it ceaseth to be either an actiue or passiue instrument of sinne whereas in the life time it is both fourthly it giues the soule passage to rest life and celestiall glorie in which wee shall see god as he is perfectly know him and praise his name for euer keeping without intermission an eternall sabboth therefore paul saith i desire to bee dissolued and bee with christ for that is best of all fiftly god exequutes his iudgements vpon the wicked and purgeth his church by death nowe in all these respects godly man haue cause not to feare and sorrowe but to reioyce in their owne death and the death of others thirdly if the day of death be so excellet yes a day of happinesse then it is lawful to desire death and man doe not alwaies sinne in wishing for death paul saith i desire to be dissolueds and againe o miserable man who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death yet this desire must not bee simple but restrained with certen respects which are these first death must bee desired so farre forth as it is a meanes to free vs from the corruption of our nature secondly as it is a meanes to bring vs to the immediate fellowship of christ amp god himselfe in heauen thirdly death may bee lawfully desired in respect of the troubles amp miseries of this life two caueats beeing obserued the first that this desire must not be immoderate the second it must bee ioyned with submission and subiection to the good pleasure of god if either of these bee wanting the desire is faulty amp therefore iob and ieremie and ionas failed herein because they desired death beeing carried away with impatience on the contrarie also a man may desire a continuace of life ezechias praied and desired to liue when he heard the message of present death that hee might doe seruice to god and paul desired to liue in regard of the philippians that hee might further their faith though in regard of himselfe to die was aduantage to him lastly if death ioyned with reformatio of life be so blessed then the death of the vnbeleeuing and vnrepentant sinner is euery way cursed amp most horrible reasons are these first it is the destruction of nature and the wages of their sins secondly in it there is no comfort of the spirit to be found no mitigatio of paine amp no good thing that may counteruaile the miseries thereof thirdly that which is the most fearefull thing of al bodily death is the beginning of eternall death desperation and infernall torment without hope of deliuerance therefore as i began so i ende haue care to liue well and die well the last combate with the diuell in the pang of death it oftentimes most dangerous of all for then he will not vrge man to desperation knowing that by this meanes he shall stir them vp to resist hm but hee labours with them that they would not resist him

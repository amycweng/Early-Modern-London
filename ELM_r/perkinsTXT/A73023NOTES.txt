The Corence of these words with the rest
The parts of this Chapt
The some and scope of this text is a description of the instrument by whom God raiseth a sinner into the state of grace and saluation
Namely a Minister of his word and he is described
1 By his titles
1 Title an Angel
Reuel 2 and 3 Chapters
Hee is Gods Angel  the Churches
Vse 1 for Ministers
This sermon was in the vniversitie church to the body of the vniuersitie
1 Vse for Ministers Go they must preach gods word as Gods word
For they carie not the it owne message but gods
2 Vse for minister They must dreach Gods word in the euidence  demonstration of gods spirit
1 Cor 14 24 25
This is done
First by teaching plainly
Secondly powerfully in that plainnesse
Ministers must magnify Gods spirit  not themselues in preaching
The 2 vse for hearers
They are to receiue the and their doctrine willingly and reuerenly
Malach 2 7
For it is Gods message though they be men that bring it
1 Corinth 11 11
2 Title an Interpreter and that two waes
1 Gods interpreter to his Church
2 Mans interpreter to God
1 Vse Ministers must haue the tongue of the learned
First he must be furnished with human learning 2 with diuinity
 He must be inwardly taught by Gods spirit
Reuel 10 8
Acts 2
This is to eat the boo of God
1 Corinth
This is no approbation to Anabaptists who depend onely on reuelations  neglect all meanes
Psal 119 18
2 Vse For ministers Esay 13
They must be holy and sanctified men and so be first of all interpreters to themselues
Exod 19 20 Leuit 10 3
For else they will hardly do good to others
2 Part of the description is the rarenes of a good Minister He is one of a thousand
The meaning
1 The truth hereof
2 The reasons hereof
1 Reason the contempt of it it being alwayes hated by wicked men
Ieremie 15 10
2 Reason the defficultie of discharging the duties
2 Corinth 2 16
3 Reason want of maintenance
Deut 10 9  28 2 Num 18 26
This makes many of our best wits turne from Diuinitie to Law
3 The vse of it
1 To Rulers to maintaine Vniuersities Colledges and schooles of the Prophets
1 Sam 19 20 21 22 23 24
The rather because the Pope doth so to vphold his superstition At Rome Reimes Doway
1 Kin 18 22
And the Iesuites to cotinue their late founded Hierarchie
Ezchiel 47 1 c
2 Vse for Ministers
1 Let euery man feare to make them fewer
2 Labour to encrease them by winning others to it
Galath 2 9
3 Let them one loue an other and ioyne together
3 Vse for students 1 To consecrate themselues and their Studies to that calling
To furnish themselues with the true ornaments of a Minister
4 Vse for Hearers 1 To reuerence the person and receiue the doctrine
Math 5 13
Gala 4 16
2 Fathers to dedicate their sonnes to the ministerie
5 Vse for al men Pray that God would encrease the number
2 Reg 2 9
3 Part of the description by his office that is to declare vnto man his righteousnesse
The meaning
Act 20 21
It comrehendeth these points
1 He must declare wher true righteousnesse is
1 John 2
2 How it may be obtained
3 He must declare it to him that is 1 Shew that it is ready for him if he beleeue and repent
2 He must testifie and assure him of it
3 He must maintaine it  auerre it against all doubts and temptations
This dutie is ordinarily peculiar to Ministers
2 Sam 11
1 Vse for Ministers
First for the Popish ministery they doe insufficiently declare it
Philip 3 8 9
Secondly our owne
Both the lawe and the gospell
2 To be holy men themselues
Psal 32
For else they will conuert but fewe
3 Vse to Ministers not to care for the contempt of the world
2 Vse for Students
To consecrate themselues to the high calling
3 Vse for the hearers Seeke righteousnesse both in the law and the Gospell
2 What to esteeme of Gods ministers
4 Vse for fathers to make their sounes Ministers
4 Point the blessings then will God haue mercy on the sinner
God  his Minister worke together
Math 16 16
Iohn 20 23
Esay 44 25 26
1 Vse for rulers to giue due reuerence to the ministers
Psalme 82
Esay 2 Vse for Ministers
2 Vse Gods word reuerently
3 Vse for Hearers 1 Heare Gods word often  reuerently
2 See the dignitie and preogatiue of the Ministers calling
Obiect But may not another Christian do it
And not ordinatily
 For they haue not the same promise
2 They haue not the same power to discerne
In extraordinary times and in want of ministers they may
5 Part the Commission which is Deliuer the penitent man from hell
How a Minister is a redeemer
More then Angels
Heb 1 vlt
More then any other calling of men
Vse 1 for Ministers
Ergo They must pray and preach diligently
1 Sam 12
Psalm 119
For so doing they are redeemers
Idle Ministers are no redeemers
Turkes and Iewes and Iesuites are carefull to seduce soules
2 Vse for Hearers
1 To see the excellencie of this calling
Ministers are Gods high Commissioners
2 Hearers Ergo must submit theselues to bee redeemed
The Cohoerence
With a new King God giues the Prophet a new Commission
Ergo extraordinary
Callings o motions in these dayes are not easily to be beleeued
The parts of the Chapt
The parts of this text
1 Point is the feare of the prophet
Doct Best Ministers most amazed at their enterance
Exod 3 11  4 10 13
Ieremie 1 6 7
Act 9 6 c
1 Tim 13
Vse Ergo Ministers and especially in the Vniuersities labour to bee humbled in sight of Gods
greatnes and their own meanenesse
2 Cor 11 4
2 Doct Ergo The Prophets hold not the opinion of the Intercession of Angels
3 Doct Ergo The calling to the Ministery is a worke like vnto the calling of a sinner to the state of grace
Vse Ergo  be required to
Qualify a man for the Ministerie
1 Cause pollution of himselfe  his people
1 His owne He was a man of polluted lippes
A he was a polluted man
And he complaineth not of capltall sinnes
But of the corruption of his nature
2 Of some omission in his calling
Doct Ergo Ministers must be men of tender conscience
And make confidence of the least sinnes
And be most carefull in his ministery both publikely and priuately
Vse Vrgo Ministers for great sins should be greatly humbled
And for great negh gece in their calling else they haue no conscience
Good and faithfull ministers not to be discouraged though they haue some wants for so the prophets had but let them complaine of them as here the prophet doth
Godly ministers find fault with themselues when the world cannot
Particularly he complaineth against the pollution of his lippes
For a Prophets dutie consists in the vse of his tongue
His smallest negligence in teaching checks his conscience
Vse 1 Vrgo popish doctrin of mans merits is false
And of workes of superrogation
And perfect fulfilling the lawe in this life
2 Vse Ergo Ministers must take heed of negligence in their function aboue all sinnes for that burtheneth the conscience most heauily of all
Other vertues are excellent but cannot suffice if this want
2 His peoples pollution
He complaines of it to teach 1 That a Minister is to confesse his peoples sinnes as wel as his owne
For generally he is accessarie to his peoples sinnes
1 Vse Ergo a minister must know his peoples sins
Pro 2 23
Ergo it is best for a Minister to bee with his people
2 Vse Ergo people must cofesse their sinnes and reueale the to their Minister
Not popish but voluntarie
And of such sinnes as disquiet the conscience
2 To teach vs that a polluted people make their Minister more or lesse polluted also
A wicked people dull and decay Gods graces in good Ministers Vse double
1 For instruction 1 See how corrupt our natur is
2 What a creeping nature sinne hath
It wil creepe from Ministers to people  from people to Minister
Ergo stop sinne in the beginning
2 For our conuersation
1 Ministers Ergo labour to liue amongst people
Iam 1 17
And in disposing themselues rather regard it then other commoditie
A poore liuing with good people better then a great liuing and euil people
2 Ergo Ministers must take heed of their company
All companies and all recreations are not for Ministers
And people must not draw their Ministers too much into company
3 People must not condemne too sharpely such Ministers as are faultie in their liues for themselues are the cause of it being of euill liues themselues
Looke what sinnes aboundes in any place and there generally the Minister is tainted with it
But such Ministers as liue with a good people and yet are loose they are not worthy to be Ministers but to be depriued
2 Cause of his feare he sawe the Lord
How In a vision
Doct the man that is in his sinnes endures not Cods presence 1 For God hates sinne aboue all things
2 Sin makes a man a debter to God
3 Sin is that that makes God angry
Degrees of Gods presence
1 To our thoughts 2 To our namig him
3 Neere in his ordinaces
4 Necrest at the last day
A sinful man feares all these
1 He neuer or vnwillingly thinks of God
Psal 10 4
Psal 10 5
2 He neuer speakes of God vnlesse it be to abuse his maiestie
3 They loue not the word nor Sacraments
Psal 14 4 4 They wish Christ would neuer coe to iudgement
2 Tim 4 8
Reuel 6 16
Extraordinary apparitios of Gods maiestie a sinfull man cannot endure
The first vse for Ministers Ergo let them not enter into
that calling in their sins
For it is into Gods presence chamber
Exod 3 
Nor come to doe the duty of that calling without repentance and holy preparation
2 rgo They are to pray before and after sermon
The 3 Vse Ergo such men are extreamly desperate who dare come to preach  minister sacraments in their sinner
Psal 50 16
Such mens labours are fruitlesse
And their leosenesse doth more hurt then their Doctrine good
By Gods seacret iudgement
Good words are vaine where there is no good life
Math 5 13
The fourth vse for Ministers Ergo Good ministers must not fly from Gods presence because of their sins but repent and so approach to his dutie
The second vse against the Papists
Ergo The apparitions of God and christ which they make so ordinary are but collusions
Gala 2 9 Mat 17 6  Luke 9 33
Reasons i 1 Apparitions of God cannot be mores dommon in the new then they were in the old Testament
2 Cor 12 2 No man in his flesh can endure gods glory
3 Vse to the people they may see Gods merey to them in teaching them by men like themselues and not by apparitions from heauen
Deut 5 25 26 27 28
2 Vse Ergo they must prepare the selues before they come to the word or Sacraments
3 Vse see the different natures of sinne and holinesse Sin drawes a man from Gods presence
Holinesse inuites a man into Gods presence
Reue 6 16 Luke 21 28 Iob 19 25 26 27
Vse Ergo if a man would haue boldnesse with God he must be a holy man
2 Generall points His consolation
wherein are 2 points 1 Circumstances of it 2 The ground of of it
Circumstances are many
1 Circumstance the time that is after his feare
Doct No consolation but after humiliation
Vse 1 To al men Ergo esteeme of afflictions namely as
Psal 39 9
2 To men distressed in conscience that their state is not desperate as they Imagine but most comfortable
Vse 3 The way to get excellent graces at Cods band is to labour to feele the wan of them
Luke 1 53 2 Psal 107 9
2 Circumstance of the Minister An Angell a Seraphim
Doct 1 Ergo there are seueral degrees of Angels that wee knowe not
Doct 2 That they are Gods guard
Psal 34 Heb 1 Doct 3 that they are the guard of Gods children
Doct That they haue speciall charge and care of godly ministers
Vse to Gods ministers I let them be content with their calling though it be full of crosses and contempts for it is honoured of the Augels aboue others
2 Ergo Let them haue courage for though men be against them Angels are with them
2 Questions
1 Ergo Whece is it that Angels attend ministers more then other men Ans 2 reasons
1 From God he will haue it so because they worke his worke more then other callings
Psal 91 11 12
2 From the Angels themselues
Because they are fellowlabourers 1 Cor 4 2 Heb 1 1 Mal 27 Reue 2  3 Chap
Because they conuert soules which delighteth the Angels aboue any in this world Heb 1 14 Luke 15 10
Reuel 19 10  22 9
2 Question what duties then are good Ministers to performe to Angels Not worship them so as the Papists doe
As all men should therfore honour that calling
1 So Ministers should labour to be faithfull in their calling
2 To adorn it with a holy life
3 To be painfull in their calling
Thus to do is to honour them
And if a Minister would reioyce the let him labour seriously so to preach as he may winne soules
3 Circumstance the maner He flewe
That is readily speedily willingly
Doct 1 So what excellent seruants of God Angels are
The fourth petition
Vse we must so serue Cod in our places
2 Corinth 9 7 Doct 2
What good friends they are to good men especially to good Ministers
1 Vse Ergo superiors loue their inferiors and contemne them not
And shew it by doing them good
2 Vse Ergo Ministers must
1 Corinth 9 19 1 Be faithfull
2 Painfull
3 Vse Ergo al men serue God cheerefully If wee be like Angels therein we shal euen be like them in glory
Pro 22 29
4 Circumstance the Instrument a Coale of fire
A strange and wonderfull meanes
And which seemes contrarie to reason
Doct r see God commendeth the vse of meanes
Gen 1 from 4 to 17
Seeing himselfe alwaies vseth them
Vse Ergo we are to vse the meanes appointed in all our purposes
Doct 2 see how Gods power doth shew it selfe in weaknes
Vse Ergo God can worke by his word and sacraments and mans Ministerie though neuer so base
Doct 2 The ap teacher must haue a fiery toong
Acts 2 That is a powerfull tongue to reproue and burne vp sinne
Ergo such Ministes are fauitie who reproue not sinne
Whence came this Coale from the Alter which fire came from heauen
Leuit 10 1 2
Doct The fire and zeale of the Minister must come from Gods spirit
Acts 1 5 Math 3 11
Not from carnal affections
Iames 3 6
For that is from hel not from heauen
Circumstance the Application of the remedie to his lips which were polluted
Doct Ergo ministers must apply their doctrin fitly
2 Point the ground of his consolation which is the forgiuenesse of his sinnes
Doct 1 Forgiuenesse  the meanes are annexed together
Vse Ergo Vse the meaues with reuerence  despise then not
Doct 2 Here comfort is from forgiuenesse of our sins
True in Dauid
2 Sam 11
And in this Prophet
Vse Here is the true way to comfort distressed consciences
Physick and outward comforts wil not serue Psal 3 3 6 7 Psal 32 3 4 Psal 51 the whole Psalm
This is done by the Author in his Cases of conscience
Doct 5 True qualification of a Minister is to be humbled and to repent
Doct 4 True Prophets  ministers shall haue helpe and comfort in their labours else Angells shall to comfort them
Geoerall points the renuing of his comission which cositaineth 3 points
1 Gods question
Whom shal I send
Not as though God had none to sed or knew not whom
2 Tim 2 19
But to our conceits and for our sake to teach vs many good doctrines
Doct  How hard to find a good Minister
Ob Ther are too many ministers for some goe vp and downe
Ans 1 Then it is a disorder in a Church
Iudges 19 18  17 8 6
Iudge 17 6
Ans 2 He seeke not for any
But for good ministers
Job 33 23 2 Corinth 2 16
Good ministers scarce euen in these dayes
Vse 1 To Ministers 1 They in the vniuersities frame themselues to the ministerie
2 Labour to be worthy Ministers
For God hath vse of them but none of vncoscionable or idle Ministers
2 Vse To the Cleargie of Rome A shame to them that being so many there are so few of them fit for God to send
Most of all their Priests  Monks are ignorant drones
The Iesuites haue learning but no conscience and are rather Statesmen then Diuines
Doct 2 No man is to goe vntill God send him
And not to run vpon priuate motions
Ob How shall I know when God calles me Ans If Gods Church allowe thy calling
Doct 3 out of the repetition of holy 3 times Here is no sufficient proofe of the Trinitie as some thinke
For the repetition made by the Angel sheweth onely how he cannot content himselfe in praysing God
But he may be proued a pluralitie of persons
Gen 1 16
Doct 4 Ministers are Gods seruants they goe for God
1 Corinth 3 9 Acts 27 23
Confessed euen by the diuel himselfe Acts 16 16 17 q What place is it they holde R His Ambassadors Iob 33 23
Vse 1 Then they must seeke to please God their maister not themselues
Vse 2 then let them do their seruice diligently and expect their reward assuredly
Though the world doe not yet God will for they are his Ambassadors
3 Vse Let no man therefore wrong them for God will not suffer his Embassadors to be abused
No king so poore that suffred it
1 King 22 26 27 28 34 c
2 King 9 33 c Act 12 1 2  23
4 Vse Ergo they must not be seruants of men that is men pleasers but his that sent them
Great men must not thinke to haue Gods seruant at their command
5 Vse Ergo they must for the glory of God their Maister both in life and doctrin
6 Vse Etgo they must deliuer Gods embassage not their owne and as they receiued it
2 Point The Prophets answere here am I send me
Doct 1 He whose sins are forgiuen comes boldly to God  to his dutie
Vse 1 Here is the true way to peace of conscience and quietnes of minde
Vse 2 To students 1 If they would be Ministers repent and get pardon of their sinnes
2 If they would be encouraged against the contempts and wrongs of the world be assured of Gods fauour in the Pardon of thy sinnes
Doct 2 We mut not set others to the labour of the Ministerie but our selues also
Vniuersitie men must not be alwayes sending out others but must also send out themselues
And Students must not deferre too long but haste to the Ministerie
For some too long as some goe too soone
Doct 3 The Prophet wil not goe till he be sent
And that not by priuate motion onely but in expresse words
Men therefore are to offer themselues but not to goe till they be sent
3 The Commission receiued
Doct  No ma is to preach without a Commission
Matth 28 19 Acts 9 6 c
This is so for these causes
Rea 1 Commissioners haue no power but from the King
Real 2 Else what they doe is without vertue or blesing Reale their persos haue no protection
Ob how may I know if God bid me goe
Ans we must not expect Gods voice from heauen
But hee speaketh to man two waies generally in his word
1 Corinth 4 1 Iob 33 23 Acts 16 17 Pro 29 18
2 Particularly God speaketh 1 by the voice of his conscience for his inclination 2 By the voice of is Church for thy gifts
Where these 2 voices call a man there God bids him goe
Vse 1 Against the that run cry they be sent
2 Against such as are called by both voices and yet will not goe
Doct 2 See the authoritie of a true mioister immediate fro God himself
Vse 1 Ergo Let no man wrong them
Vse 2 Ergo Let Ministers be comforted in doing their dutie for if God send them he wil neuer faile them

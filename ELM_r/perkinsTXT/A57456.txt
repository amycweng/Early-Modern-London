vnto the former principles published by that reverend ma mr william perkins fully containing what every christian is beleeve touching god and himselfe i have thought it fit for the good especially of those over whom i am set the younger sort of whom i have formerly catechised in private according to the same principles to annex a few other touching the more solemne fellowship of christians the church of god as being a divine institution the spirituall paradijse and temple of the living god in which his most solemne services are to bee performed and to which he addeth daily such as shall be saved promising to dwell in the middest of them by his most powerfull and gracious presence question what is the church a a company of faithfull and holy people with their seed called by the word of god into publicke covenant with christ amp amongst themselves for mutuall fellowship in the use of all the meanes of god glory and their salvation q of what sort or number of people must this company consist a it is all one whether they be high or low few or many so as they exceed not such a number as may ordinarily meet together in one place for the worshipping of god and sanctification of the lord day q what are the reasons why the church must consist of faithfull and holy persons a the levit rom corinthian philipp verse scriptures every where so teach the ephesians column church is the body of christ all whose members therefore should be conformable in some measure to him their head onely such worshippers please god amp are accepted of him ioh prov hob ampc amp have right to the covenant of grace and seales thereof q but are not hypocrites mingled with the faithfull in the church a none ought to be by the word of god and where such are they are not truly added by the lord to the church but doe iudge ver ezek creepe in through their owne hipocrisie and not without the churches sin also if they may be discerned to be such q by what meanes is the church gathered a by the word preached and by faith received of them that heare it q is every beleever a member of the visible church a no but he must also by his personall amp publick profession adioyne himselfe to some particular fellowship and societie of saints q how prove you the seed of the faithfull to be of the church with them a by the covenant which god made with abraham and his seed which was the covenant of the gospell and confirmed in christ the seale there of circumcision being the seale of the righteousnesse of saith q what are the essentiall markes of the church a faith and order as the church in them may be seene and beheld to walke in christ iesus whom she hath received faith professed in word and deed shewing the matter to be true and order in the holy things of god shewing the forme to be true which are the two essentiall parts of the church q are not the preaching of the word and administring of the sacraments certaine marks of the church a no for the word may and that rightly be preached to assemblies of unbeleevers for their conversion as may the sacraments also though uniustly bee administred unto them and so be made lying signes besides the true church may for a time want the use of diverse ordinances of god but hath alwayes right unto them as may also the false church usurpe and abuse them but without right q what are the meanes in and by which christ and the church have fellowship together a in the gifts of the spirit of christ in the offices of ministery given to the church in the workes done in and by those gifts and offices q wherein standeth this communion of the spirit a in the in dwelling amp operation of the gifts amp graces thereof conveyed from christ as the head unto the church as his body and members one of another whence ariseth that most streight and divine conjunction by which as by the civill bond of mariage the man and wife are one flesh so they who are thus iojned to christ are one spirit q how many are the offices of ministery in the church a five besides the extraordinary offices of apostles prophets and evangelists for the first plant of the churches which are ceased with their extraordinarie gifts q how is that proved a partly by the scriptures which both mention them expresly amp describe them by their principall gifts and workes and partly by reason agreable to the scriptures q shew me which those officers be with their answerable gifts and workes a the pastor to whom is given the spirit of wisedome for exhortation the teacher to whom is given the gift of knowledge for doctrine the governing elder who is to rule with diligence the deacon who is to administer the holy treasure with simplicie the widow or deaconnesse who is to attend the sick and impotent with compassion and cheerefulnesse q what is the reason for the proving of these ministeries a because all these are necessary amp these alone sufficient for the church as being the most perfect societie and bodie of christ which neither faileth in that which is necessary nor exceedeth in any thing superfluous q whence ariseth the necessity amp sufficiencie of these ministeries in the church a from the condition partly of the soules and partly of the body of the members q how doth that appeare a in the soule is the facultie of understanding about which the teacher is to be exercised for information by doctrine the will and affections upon which the pastor is especially to work by exhortation and comfort for that doctrine and exhortation without obedience are unprofitable the diligence of the ruling elder is requisite for that purpose q how are the other two ministeries to be excised a as the church consisteth of man and they of soules and body so are the deacons our of the churches treasure amp contribution to provide for the common uses of the church reliefe of the poore amp maintenance of the officers as are the widowes to afford unto the sick and impotent in body not able otherwise to helpe themselves their cheerefull and comfortable service q wherefore call you those offices by the name of ministeries or services a for two causes for that they are no lordships but meere services of christ and of the church because they consist in administring onely of those things which are christs and the churches under him q by whom are these officers to have their outward calling a by the church whereof they are members for the present and to which they are to administer q how doth that appeare a the apostles who taught onely christs commandements so directed the churches the people amongst whom they have been conversant can best iudge of their fitnesse both in respect of their persons and families it furthereth much the diligence and faithfulnes of the minister that they whose minister he is have freely chosen him as unto whom under christ they commit the most precious treasure of their soule as also it bindes the people to greater love and conscience of obedience of him amp his ministery whom theselves have made choice of the church being a most free corporation spirituall under christ the lord is in all reason and equity to chuse her ministers and servant under him unto whom also she is to give wages for their service and labour q is this outward calling of simple necessity for a true church officer a yes as for the magistrate in the city and common wealth or steward in the family without which they usurp their places how excellent soever whether in their gifts or workes q what is the officer bee found unfaithfull in his place a he is by the church to bee warned to take heede to his ministery he hath received to fullfill it which if he neglect to doe by the same power which set him up hee is to be put downe and deposed q what are the outward workes of the churches communion with christ a these six praier the reading and opening of the word the sacraments singing of psalmes censures contribution to the necessity of the saints q wherefore put you prayer in the first place a because by it all the rest are sanctified to the faithfull for prayer see the end of the fifth principle with the exposition onely adde this that in the act of our speaking unto god by prayer we are not to use the help of any booke beads crucifixes or the like to reach or provoke us but onely the helpe of the spirit of adoption and prayer working in our hearts effectually and teaching us both what and how to pray as we ought q what beleeve you touching the word a besides the things observed in the fifth principle and exposition that the whole written word and it alone is to be read and opened in the church q wherefore are the whole scriptures to be read and opened a because the whole word of god is pure written for our learning and comfort given by divine inspiration and is profitable for doctrine reproofe correction and instruction and from which nothing may be diminished q how prove you that the scriptures onely are to bee read and opened in the church a because they alone are sufficient for faith and the obedience which is of faith amp able to make the man of god perfect throughly furnished unto all good workes and unto which nothing may be added q who are to open and apply the scriptures in the church a principally the bishops or elders who by the word of life are to feed the flocke both in teaching and governement secondly such as are out of office in the exercise of prophesie q how is that exercise proved in the scriptures a by luke and cap act and cap and cap examples in the iewish church where man though in no office either in temple or synagogue had libertly publikely to use their gifts luke cap rom pet corinthian by the commandement of christ amp his apostles by the prohibiting of tim corinthian pet thess tim corinthian act luke woman not extraordinarily inspired to teach in the church herein liberty being given unto man their husbands or others by the excellent ends which by this meanes are to be obtained as the glorie of god in the manifestation of his manifold graces that the gifts of the spirit in man be not quenched for the fitting and tryall of man for the ministery for the preserving pure of the doctrine of the church which is more endangered if some one or two alone may onely be heard and speake for debaring and satisfying of doubts if any doe arise for the edifying of the church and conversion of others q who is a prophet in this sence a he that hath a gift of the spirit to speak unto edification exhortation and comfort q what is the order of this exercise a that it be performed after the publike ministery by the teachers and under their direction and moderation whose duty it is if any thing be obscure to open it if doubtfull to cleare it if unsound to refute it if unperfect to supply what is wanting as they are able q what beleeve you touching the sacraments further then is observed in the former principles a that they are to be dispensed according to the tenure of the covenant of grace whereof they are seales in respect both of the persons to whom and of the ends for which they are to be administred q which are those persons a the faithfull and their seed qmay all the faithfull partake in the sacraments a no except they be also added to some particular congregation unto which the publike ordinances and ministery doth appertaine q which are the ends and uses of the sacraments a the first is from god to the church opened in the exposition of the fifth principle where it is shewed what a sacrament is the second is from the church to god in which it testifieth the acceptance of the covenant amp bindeth it selfe to the performance of the conditions the third is in respect of the members themselves mutually as being badges of their association the fourth in respect of all other assemblies between whom amp the churches they are notes of distinction q what is required touching singing of psalmes in the church a that they bee such as are parts of the word of god formed by the holy ghost into psalmes or songs which many may conveniently sing together exhorting and admonishing themselves mutually with grace in their heart q what beleeve you touching the censure of excommunication a that it is to be used by every particular church according to the rules of christ qhow prove you this power to bee in every particular congregation a by the donation and gift of christ the lord the particular church of corinthian had this power for the neglect wherof it is reproved by the apostle every particular church hath right to the word sacraments and praier within it selfe which are greater and therefore to this which is less then they q what are the rules of christ for excommunication a the sin thus to be censured must be scandalous and the person obstinate after due conviction and patience used the church excommunicating must bee that particular congregation gathered together in the name of christ whereof the sinner is a member q how prove you that by the church math is not meant the bishop or presbytery representing the body a one man cannot be a church which as christ teacheth verse must bee a company how small soever gathered together in his name the word there used never signifieth in the scriptures an officer or officers excluding the people the apostle corinthian expounds christs meaning to bee of the whole body come together the elders being publicke officers are to exercise the solemne workes of their office and particularly the worke of rebuking them that sinne openly and before the church both that others may feare and the church of faith consent to the excommunication and therefore cannot represent the church being actually present a representative church in a case of faith and conscience without the consent of the represented in the particular decree establisheth the popish doctrine of implicite faith q what is the order of proceeding in this censure a that a brother offending privately be admonished privately and after without his repentance with a witnesse or two who may give testimony both of the offence and admonition and lastly that by the brother admonishing with his witnesses the sinner remaining obstinate complaint bee made to the church which last complaint alone is sufficient in publike offences q what order is to bee observed after complaint thus made a the officers as the governours of the church are by the scriptures clearely to convince and seriously to admonish and exhort the offender and upon his impenitency with due conviction and patience to decree against him the sentence of excommunication and lastly with the peoples free consent to pronounce and execute the same q how appeareth the necessity of this ordination a many waies by the commandement of christ and practice of the apostolicall churches for the glory of christ which is much impeached by the prophanesse of those who professe his service for the humbling of the sinner and for the salvation of his soule to prevent the infection of others that by zeale and holinesse of the church they without may be gained to the gospell q how is the church to walke towards a person excommunicated a so as they may make him ashamed by withdrawing from him in all spirituall communion and civill familiarity also so farre as may be without the violation of any naturall or civill bond q what is to be observed for the churches contribution a that in their publike meeting they contribute as god hath prospered them to the publicke treasury by the deacons to be received and distributed as there is need to the releefe of the poore maintenance of the ministerie and other necessary uses of the church first and after of others also as need requireth and whosoever will walke according to this rule peace be upon them and mercy and upon the israel of god galath

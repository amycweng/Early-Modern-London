i beleeue in god ampc no man iustly can be offended at this that i begin to treate of the doctrine of faith without a text though some be of minde that in catechising the minister is to proceed as in the ordinarie course of preaching only by handling a set portion of scripture amp therfore that the handling of the creed being no scripture is not convenient indeed i graunt that other course to be commendable yet i doubt not but in catechising the minister hath his libertie to follow or not to follow a certaine text of scripture as we doe in the usuall course of preaching my reason is taken from the practise of the primitive church whose catechisme as the authour of the epistle to the hebrewes sheweth was contained in sixe principles or grounds of religion which were not taken out of any set text in the olde testament but rather was a forme of teaching gathered out of the most cleare places thereof hence i reason thus that which in this point was the use and maner of the primitiue church is lawful to be used of vs now but in the primitiue church it was the maner to catechize without handling any set text of scripture and therefore the ministers of the gospell at this time may with like libertie doe the same so be it they doe confirme the doctrine which they teach with places of scripture afterwarde now to come to the creed let vs begin with the name or title thereof that which in english we call the apostles creed in other tongues is called symbolum that is a shot or a badge it is called a shot because as in a feast or banket euery man payeth his part which being all gathered the whole which we call the shot amounteth and so out of the seuerall writings of the apostles ariseth this creed or briefe cofession of faith it is a badge because as a soldier in the field by his badge amp livery is knowen of what band he is amp to what captain he doth belong eue so by this beleefe a christia ma may be distinguished amp known fro all iewes turkes atheists amp all false professors amp for this cause it is called a badge againe it is called the creed of the apostles not because they were the penners of it conferring to it besides the matter ruffin in expos symb amp hierony ad pam the very stile amp frame of words as we haue them now set downe reason i there are in this creed certaine words and phrases which are not to be found in the writings of the apostles and namely these he descended into hell the catholike church the latter wherof no doubt pacianus epistle ad sympro first began to be in use when after the apostles daies the church was dispersed into all quarters of the earth ii secondly if both matter and wordes had bene from the apostles why is not the creed canonicall scripture as well as any other of their writings iii the apostles had a summarie collection of the points of christian religion which they taught and also deliuered to others to teach by consisting of two heades faith and love as may appeare by pauls exhortation to timothie wishing him to keepe the patterne of holesome words which he had heard of him in faith and love which is in christ iesus now the creede consists not of two heads but of one namely of faith only and not of loue also vvherefore i rather thinke that it is called the apostles creede because it doth summarily conteine the chiefe and principall pointes of religion handled and propounded in the doctrine of the apostles and because the pointes of the creed are conformable and agreeable to their doctrine and writings and thus much of the title now let vs heare what the creed is it is a summe of things to be beleeued concerning god and concerning the church gathered foorth of the scriptures for the opening of this description first i say it is a summe of things to be beleeued or an abridgement it hath bene the practise of teachers both in the new and old testament to abridge and contract summarily the religion of their time this the prophets used for when they had made their sermons to the people they did abridge them and penned them briefly setting them in some open place that all the people might reade the same so the lorde bad habakuk to write the vision which he saw and to make it plaine upon tables that he may runne that readeth it and in the new testament the apostles did abridge those doctrines which otherwise they did handle at large as may appeare in the place of timothy afore named now the reason why both in the old amp new testament the doctrine of religion was abridged is that the understanding of the simple as also their memory might be hereby helped amp they better inabled to iudge of the truth amp to discerne the same fro falshood and for this end the apostles creed being a summary collectio of things to be beleeued was gathered briefly out of the word of god aug sermon de temp cassian li de incarnat domini for the helping of memory amp understanding of man i adde that this creede is concerning god and the church for in these two points consisteth the whole summe therof lastly i say that it is gathered forth of the scripture to make a difference betweene it amp other writings and to shew the authoritie of it there be two kind of writings in which the doctrine of the church is handled amp they are either divine or ecclesiasticall diuine are the bookes of the old amp new testament penned either by prophets or apostles and these are not only the pure word of god but also the scripture of god because not only the matter of them but the whole disposition thereof with the stile amp the phrase was set down by the immediate inspiration of the holy ghost and the authoritie of these bookes is diuine that is absolute and soveraigne amp they are of sufficiet credit in and by theselves needing not the estimony of any creature not subiect to the cesure either of me or angels binding the coscieces of all me at all times amp being the only foudatio of faith amp the rule amp cano of all truth ecclesiasticall writings are all other ordinary writings of the church consenting with scriptures these may be called the word or truth of god so far forth as their matter or substance is consenting with the written worde of god but they cannot be called the scripture of god because the stile and phrase of them was set downe according to the pleasure of man and therfore they are in such sort the word of god as that also they are the word of man and their authoritie in defining of trueth amp falshood in matters of religion is not soveraigne but subordinate to the former and it doth not stand in the authority amp pleasures of man amp councels but in the consent which they haue with the scriptures ecclesiasticall writings are either generall particular or proper generall are the creedes and confessions of the church dispersed over the whole world and among the rest the creed of the apostles made either by the apostles themselues or by their hearers amp disciples apostolic man delivered to the church amp conveyed from hand to hand to our times particular writings are the confessions of particular churches proper writings are the books amp confessions of private man now betweene these we must make difference for the generall creede of the apostles other universall creeds in this case not excepted though it be of lesse authoritie then scripture yet hath it more authoritie then the particular and priuate writings of churches and man for it hath bene received and approved by universall consent of the catholike church in all ages and so were neuer these in it the meaning and doctrine can not be changed by the authoritie of the whole catholicke church and if either the order of the doctrine or the wordes whereby it is expressed should upon some occasion be changed a particular church of any cuntry can not doe it without catholike consent of the whole church yet particular writings amp cofessions made by some speciall churches may be altered in the words amp in the points of doctrine by the same churches without offence to the catholicke church lastly it is receiued as a rule of faith amog all churches to try doctrines amp interpretations of scriptures by not because it is a rule of it selfe for that the scripture is alone but because it boroweth his authority from scripture with which it agreeth and this honour no other writings of man can haue here some may demaund the number of creeds answer i say but one creede as there is but one faith and if it be alledged that we have many creedes as besides this of the apostles the nicene creede and athanasius creede ampc i answer the severall creedes and confessions of churches containe not seuerall faithes and religions but one and the same and this called the apostles creed is most ancient amp principall all the rest are not new creedes in substance but in some points penned more largely for the exposition of it that man might better avoid the heresies of their times futther it may be demaunded in what forme this creed was penned answer in the forme of an answer to a question the reason is this in the primitiue church when any man was turned from gentilisme to the faith of christ and was to be baptised this cyril catec mystag tertull de resurrect orige bo in nu question was asked him what beleeuest thou then he answered according to the forme of the creede i beleeve in god ampc and this manner of questioning was used euen from the time of the apostles when the eunuch was converted by philip he said what doth let me to be baptised philip said if thou doest beleeve with all thine heart thou maiest then he answered i beleeve that iesus christ is the son of god by this it appeares that although all man for the most part amongst vs can say this creede yet not one of a thousand can tell the ancient and first use of it for commonly at this day of the simpler sort it is said for a prayer being indeede no prayer and when it is used so man make it no better then a charme before vve come to handle the particular pointes of the creed it is very requisite that we should make an entrance thereto by describing the nature properties and kindes of faith the confession and ground whereof is set foorth in the creede faith therefore is a gift of god whereby we giue assent or credence to god word for there is a necessarie relatio between faith amp god word the comon property of faith is noted by the authour of the hebrews when he saith faith is the ground of things hoped for and the demonstration of things that are not seene for all this may be understoode not onely of iustifying faith but also of temporarie faith and the faith of miracles where faith is said to be a ground the meaning is that though there are many things promised by god which man do not presently enioy but only hope for because as yet they are not yet faith doeth after a sort giue subsisting or being vnto them secondly it is an euidence or demonstration ampc that is by beleeuing a ma doth make a thing as it were visible being otherwise invisible amp abset faith is of two sorts either common faith or the faith of the elect as paul saith he is an apostle according to the faith of god elect which also is called faith without hypocrisie the common faith is that which both elect and reprobate haue and it is threefold i is historicall faith which is when a man doth beleeve the outward letter and historie of the word it hath two partes knowledge of god worde and an assent to the same knowledge amp it is to be found in the deuill and his angels so s iames saith the devil beleeve and tremble some will say what a faith haue they answer such as thereby they understand both the law and the gospell besides they giue an assent to it to be true and they do more yet in that they tremble and feare and many a man hath not so much for amongst vs there is many a one which hath no knowledge of god at all more then he hath learned by the common talke of the world as namely that there is a god and that he is mercifull ampc and yet this man will say that he beleeueth with all his heart but without knowledge it can not be that any should truly beleeue amp therfore he deceiveth himselfe quest but whence haue the devil historicall faith were they illuminated by the light of the spirit answer no but when the gospell was preached they did acknowledge it and beleeued it to be true amp that by vertue of the reliques of god image which remained in them since their fall and therefore this their faith doeth not arise from any speciall illumination by his spirit but they attaine to it by the light of nature which was left in them from the beginning the second kind of faith is temporary faith so called because it lasteth but for a time and season and commonly not to the end of a mans life this kind of faith is noted unto us in the parable of the seede that fell in the stony ground and there be two differences or kinds of this faith the first kinde of temporary faith hath in it three degrees the first is to know the word of god and particularly the gospell the second to giue an assent unto it the third to professe it but to goe no further and all this may be done without any loue to the word this faith hath one degree more then historicall faith examples of it we haue in simon magus acts who is said to beleeue because he held the doctrine of the apostle to be true and withall he professed it and in the devil also who in some sort professed that christ was the son of the most highest amp yet looked for no saluation by him mark act and this is the common faith that abounds in this land man say they beleeue as the prince beleeueth and if religion chage they will change for by reason of the authoritie of princes lawes they are made to learne some litle knowledge of the word they beleeue it to be good amp they professe it amp thus for the space of thirtie or fourtie yeres they will heare the word preached and receiue the sacraments and yet be as void of grace as euer they were at the first day amp the reason is because man doe barely professe it without either liking or loue of the same the second kinde of temporarie faith hath in it fiue degrees for by it first a man knows the word secondly he assenteth unto it iii he professeth it iiii he reioyceth inwardly in it v he bringeth forth some kind of fruit and yet for all this hath no more in him but a faith that will faile in the end because he wanteth the effectuall applicatio of the promise of the gospel amp is without all maner of sound conversio this faith is like corne in the house top which groweth for a while but when heate of sommer cometh it withereth and this is also set forth vnto vs in the parable of the seede which fell in a stony ground which is hastie in springing up but because of the stones which will not suffer it to take deepe roote it withereth and this is a very common faith in the church of god by which many reioyce in the preaching of the worde and for a time bring forth some fruits accordingly with shewe of great forwardnesse yet afterward shake of religion and all but some will say howe can this be a temporary faith seeing it hath such fruits answer such a kind of faith is temporary because it is grounded on temporarie causes vvhich are three i a desire to get knovvledge of some straunge pointes of religion for many a man doth labour for the fiue former degrees of temporarie faith onely because he desires to get more knovvledge in scripture then other man haue the second cause is a desire of praise among man which is of that force that it will make a man put on a shevve of all the graces vvhich god bestoweth on all his children though otherwise he want them and to go very farre in religion vvhich appeareth thus some can very bitterly weepe for the sinnes of other man and yet haue neither sorrowe nor griefe for their owne and the cause hereof is nothing else but pride for he that sheddes teares for another mans sinnes should much more vveepe for his owne if he had grace yet thus are many man disposed euen of pride and nothing else againe a man for his owne sinnes vvill pray very slackly and dully when he prayeth priuately and yet when he is in the company of others will pray very fervently and earnestly from vvhence is this difference surely often it springeth from the pride of heart and from a desire of praise among man the third cause of temporarie faith is profit commodity the getting of wealth and riches these make man to receive religion and if other religion come they vvill receiue it asvvell as this but such studies not the gospell because it is the gospell but because it brings wealth peace and riches with it and these are the three causes of temporarie faith the third kind of faith is the faith of miracles vvhen a man grounding himselfe on some speciall promise or revelation from god doeth beleeve that some straunge amp extraordinarie thing vvhich he hath desired or foretold shall come to passe by the vvork of god this must be distinguished from historicall amp temporarie faith for simon magus had both these kindes of faith but yet wanted this faith of miracles amp therfore would haue bought the same of the apostles for money yet this faith of miracles may be in hypocrites as it vvas in iudas amp at the last iudgement it shall be found to haue bin in the wicked amp reprobate which shal say to christ lorde in thy name we haue prophesied and cast out devil and done many great miracles and thus much for the three sorts of common faith now we must come to the true faith which is the faith of the elect it is thus defined faith is a supernaturall gift of god in the mind apprehending the sauing promise with al the promises that depend on it first i say it is a gift of god philipp to confute the blind opinio of our people that think that the faith wherby they are to be saued is bred amp borne with the i adde that it is a gift supernaturall not onely because it is aboue that corrupt nature in which we are borne but also because it is aboue that pure nature in which our first parents were created for in the state of innocencie they wanted this faith neither had they then any neede of faith in the same god as he is messias but this faith is a new grace of god added to regeneration after the fal amp first required in the couenant of grace and by this faith differeth from the rest of the gifts of god as the feare of god the loue of god the loue of our brother ampc for these were in mans nature before the fall and after it they are but renewed but iustifying faith admits no renewing for the first in grafting of it into the heart is in the conuersion of a sinner after his fall the place and seat of faith as i thinke is the minde of man not the will for it stands in a kinde of particular knowledge or perswasion and there is no perswasion but in the minde paul saith indeede that we beleeue with the heart rom but by the heart he vnderstands the whole soule without any limitation some doe place faith partly in the minde and partly in the will because it hath two parts knowledge and affiance but it doth not stand greatly with reason that one particular and single grace should be seated into diverse parts of the soule the forme of faith is to apprehend the promises gal that we might receiue the promise of the spirite through faith and john to receiue christ and to beleeue are put one for another and to beleeue is to eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of christ to apprehend properly is an action of the hand which laies hold of a thing and puls it to it and by resemblance it agrees to faith which is the hand of the soule receiuing and applying the sauing promise this apprehension of faith is not performed by any affection of the will but by a sound and particular perswasion whereby a man is resolued that the promise of saluation belongs vnto him which perswasion is wrought in the mind by the holy ghost corint and by this the promise which is generall is applied particularly to one subiect by this sauing faith differeth from all other kinds of faith from historicall for it wanteth all apprehension amp standeth onely in a generall assent from temporarie faith which though it make a man to professe the gospel and to reioyce in it yet doth it not throughly applie christ with his benefits for it neuer brings with it any thorough touch of conscience or liuely sense of god grace in the heart and the same may be said of the rest the principal and maine obiect of this faith is the sauing promise god so loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son that whosoeuer beleeues in him shall not perish but haue euerlasting life but some will say christ is commonly said to be the obiect of faith answer in effect it is all one to say the sauing promise and christ promised who is the substance of the couenant christ then as he is set forth vnto vs in the word and sacraments is the obiect of faith and here certaine questions offer themselues to be skanned the first what is that particular thing which faith apprehendeth answer faith apprehendeth whole christ god and man for his godhead without his manhoode and his manhood without his godhead doth not reconcile vs to god yet this which i say must be conceiued with some distinction according to the difference of his two natures his godhead is apprehended not in respect of his essence or nature but in respect of his efficacie manifested in the mahoode his manhood both in respect of the substance it selfe and also in respect of the efficacie and benefits thereof the second in what order faith appreheds christ ans first of all it apprehends the very body amp blood of christ amp secondly the vertue amp benefits of his bodie and blood as a man that would feele in his bodie the vertue of meate and drinke must first of all receiue the substance thereof to go forward besides the mayn promise which cocernes righteousnes amp life in christ there be other particular promises touching stregth in temptatios cofort in afflictios amp such like which deped on the former amp they also are the obiect of iustifying faith amp with the very same faith we beleue the wherwith we beleeue our saluatio thus abraha by the same faith wherwith he was iustified beleued that he shold haue a son in his old age ro and noe by that faith wherby he was made heire of righteousnes beleeued that he amp his family should be preserued in the flood and hereupo it comes to passe that in our praiers besides the desire of things promised we must bring faith whereby we must be perswaded that god will graunt vs such things as he hath promised and this faith is not a new kinde or distinct faith from iustifying faith thus we see what sauing faith is whereas some are of opinio that faith is an affiace or cofidence that seems to be otherwise for it is a fruit of faith amp indeede no man can put any confidence in god till he be first of all perswaded of god mercy in christ towards him some again are of mind that loue is the very nature and forme of faith but it is otherwise for as cofidence in god so also loue is an effect which proceeds fro faith tim the end of the law is loue fro a pure heart and good conscience amp faith vnfained and in nature they differ greatly christ is the fountain of the water of life faith in the heart is as the pipe amp ledds that receiue in amp hold the water amp loue in some part is as the cocke of the coduit that lets out the water to euery comer the property of the had is to hold amp of it self it canot cut yet by a knife or other instrumet put into the had it cuts the had of the soule is faith amp his property is to apprehend christ with al his benefits amp by it self it ca do nothing els yet ioyn loue to it amp by loue it wilbe effectual in al good duties now to proceed further first we are to cosider how faith is wrought what be the differeces of it for the first faith is wrought in amp by the outward ministery of the gospel accopanied by the inward operatio of the spirit amp that not suddely but by certe steps amp degrees as nature frameth the body of the infant in the mothers wombe by making the brain and heart by making veines sinewes arteries bones by adding flesh to them al and the whole operation of the spirit stands in two principall actions first the enlightening of the minde the second the moouing of the will for the first the holy ghost enlightens mens mindes with a further knowledge of the lawe then nature can afoard and thereby makes them to see the sinnes of their hearts and liues with the ouglines thereof and withall to tremble at the curse of the lawe afterward the same spirit opens the eye to vnderstand and consider seriously of righteousnes amp life eternal promised in christ this done then comes the second worke of the holy ghost which is the inflaming of the will that a man hauing considered his fearefull estate by reason of sinne and the benefits of christes death might hunger after christ and haue a desire not so much to haue the punishmets of sinne taken away as god displeasure amp also might enioy the benefits of christ and whe he hath stirred vp a man to desire reconciliation with god in christ then withall he giues him grace to pray not onely for life eternall but especially for the free remission and pardon of all his sinnes and then the lordes promise is knocke and it shall be opened seeke and ye shall finde after which he further sends his spirit into the same heart that desireth reconciliation with god and remission of sinnes in christ and doth seale vp in his heart the liuely and plentifull assurance thereof the differences and degrees of faith are two i a weake faith ii a strong faith concerning the first this weake faith shewes it selfe by this grace of god namely an vnfained desire not onely of saluation for that the wicked and gracelesse man may haue but of reconciliation with god in christ this is a sure signe of faith in euery touched and humbled heart and it is peculiar to the elect and they which haue this haue in them also the substance of true sauing faith which afterwards will grow vp to a strong faith reasons i promise of life euerlasting is made to the desire of reconciliation psalm lord thou hast heard the desire of the poore psalm my soule desireth after thee as the thirstie land psalm he will fulfill the desire of them that feare him matth blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnes for they shalbe satisfied revel j will giue vnto him which is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely ii the hungring desire after grace is a sanctified affection vvhere one affection is sanctified all are sanctified where all are sanctified the whole man is sanctified and he that is sanctified is iustified and beleeues iii god accepts the will and desire to repent and beleeue for repenting and beleeuing indeede wherefore this desire of reconciliation if it be soundly wrought in the heart is accepted euen as faith before god but carnall man will say if faith yes true faith shew it selfe by a desire of reconciliation with god in christ for all our sinnes then we are well ynough though we liue in our sinnes for we haue very good desires j answer that there be in many man sundrie fleeting motions and desires to do good things which grow to no issue or head but in time vanish as they come now such passions haue no soundnes in them amp must be distinguished from the desire of reconciliatio with god which comes from a bruised heart which brings alwaies with it reformation of life therefore such as liue after the couse of this world and thinke notwithstanding that they haue desires that are good deceiue themselues nowe faith is saide to be weake when a man either failes in the knowledge of the gospell or else hauing knowledge is weake in grace to applie vnto himselfe the sweete promises thereof as for example we know that the apostles had all true sauing faith except iudas and when our sauiour christ asked them whome they thought that he was peter in the person of the rest answered for them all and said thou article christ the son of the liuing god for which our sauiour commended him and in him them all saying thou article peter amp vpon this rocke that is vpon christ which peter did professe in the name of them all will i builde my church and yet after we shall finde in the gospell that they are called man of litle faith now they failed in knowledge of the death of christ and of his passion and resurrection and were caried away with a vaine hope of an earthly kingdome and therefore when our sauiour shewed them of his going downe to ierusalem and of his sufferings there peter a little after his notable confession began to rebuke christ amp said master haue pitie on thy selfe this shall not be vnto thee and vntil he had appeared to them after his death they did not beleeue his resurrection again weake faith though it be ioyned with knowledge yet it may faile in the applying or in the apprehension and appropriating of christs benefits to a mans owne selfe this is to be seene in ordinary experience for many a man there is of humble and contrite heart that serueth god in spirite and truth yet is not able to say without great doubtings and wauerings i know and am fully assured that my sinnes are pardoned now shall we say that all such are without faith god forbid nay we may resolue our selues that the true child of god may haue a hungring desire in his heart after reconciliation with god in christ for all his sinnes with care to keepe a good conscience and yet be weake some time in the apprehension of god mercie and the assurance of the remission of his owne sinnes but if faith faile either in the true knowledge or in the apprehension of god mercies how can a man be saued by it answer we must knowe that this weake faith will as truly apprehend god mercifull promises for the pardon of sinne as strong faith though not so soundly euen as a man with a palsie hand can stretch it out as well to receiue a gift at the hand of a king as he that is more sound though it be not so firmely and steadfastly the church of rome beares man in hand that they are good catholicks if they beleeue as the church beleeues though in the meane season they can not tell what the church beleeues and some papists commend this faith by the example of an old devout father who beeing tempted of the deuill was asked how he beleeued he answered that he beleeued as the church beleeued beeing againe asked how the church beleeued he answered as i beleeue whereupon the deuill as they say was faint to depart vvell this fond and ridiculous kind of faith we renounce as being a means to nozle man in blindnes superstition amp perpetuall ignorance yet withall we doe not denie but that there is an implicite or foulded faith which is when a man as yet hauing but some little portion of knowledge in the doctrine of the gospell doth truely performe obedience according to the measure thereof and withall hath care to get more knowledge and shewes good affection to all good meanes whereby it may be increased in this respect a certain ruler who by a miracle wrought vpon his childe was mooued to acknowledge christ for the messias and further to submit him selfe to his doctrine is commended for a beleeuer and in the like case the samaritanes and thus much of weake faith which must be vnderstood to be in a man not all the daies of his life but while he is a yong babe in christ for as it is in the state of the body first we are babes amp grow to greater strength as we growe in yeres so it is with a christian man first he is a babe in christ hauing weake faith but after growes from grace to grace till he come to haue a strong faith example whereof we haue in abraham who was strong and perfect both in knowledge and apprehension this strong faith is when a man is endued with the knowledge of the gospel amp grace to apprehend and applie the righteousnes of christ vnto himselfe for the remission of his own sinnes so as he can say distinctly of himselfe and truly that he is fully resolued in his own conscience that he is recociled vnto god in christ for all his sinnes amp accepted in him to life euerlasting this degree of faith is proper to him that begins to be a tall man and of ripe yeares in christ and it commeth not at the first calling of a man vnto grace and if any shall thinke that he can haue it at the first he deceiueth him selfe for as it is no nature first wee are babes and then as we encrease in yeares so wee growe in strength so it is in the life of a christian first ordinarily hee hath a weake faith and after growes from grace to grace till he come to stronger faith and at the last he be able to say he is fully assured in his heart amp conscience of the pardon of his sinnes amp of reconciliation to god in christ and this assurance ariseth from many experiences of god fauour and loue in his life and preseruation which brings a man to this that he is fully perswaded that god is his god and god the father his father and iesus christ his redeemer and the holy ghost his sanctifier now howsoeuer this faith be strong yet is it alwaies imperfect as also our knowledge is and shall so long as we liue in this world be mingled with contrarie vnbeliefe and sundrie doubtings more or lesse a great part of man amogst vs blinded with grosse ignorance say they haue faith amp yet indeed haue not for aske them what faith they haue they will answer they beleeue that god is their father amp the son their redeemer ampc aske them how long they haue had this faith they will answer euer since they could remember aske them whether they euer doubt of god fauour they will say they would not once doubt for all the worlde but the case of these man is to be pitied for howsoeuer they may perswade themselues yet true it is that they haue no sound faith at all for euen strong faith is assaulted with temptations and doubtings and god will not haue man perfect in this life that they may alwaies goe out of themselues and depend wholly on the merit of christ and thus much of these two degrees of faith nowe in whom so euer it is whether it be a weake faith or a strog it bringeth forth some fruit as a tree doth in the time of sommer and a speciall fruit of faith is this confession of faith i beleeue in god ampc so paul saith with the heart a man may beleeue vnto righteousnes and with the mouth man confesseth to saluation confession of faith is when a man in speach and outwarde profession doth make manifest his faith for these two causes i that with his mouth outwardly he may glorifie god both in bodie and soule ii that by the confession of his faith he may seuer himselfe from all false christians from atheists hypocrites and all false seducers whatsoeuer and as this is the dutie of a christian man to make profession of his faith so here in this creede of the apostles we haue the right order and forme of making it set downe as we shal see in hadling the parts therof the creede therefore sets downe two things concerning faith namely the action of faith and his obiect which also are the parts of the creede the action in these words i beleeue the obiect in all the words following in god the father almightie maker ampc and first let vs begin with the action i beleeue in god we are taught to say i beleeue not we beleeue for two causes first because as we touched before in the primitiue church this creede was made to be an answer made vnto a question which was demanded of euery particular man that was baptized for they asked him thus what dost thou beleeue then he answered i beleeue in god the father ampc and thus did euery one of yeares make profession of his faith and it is likely that peter alluded hereunto saying the stipulation or answer of a good conscience maketh request to god the secod cause is howsoeuer we are to pray one for another by saying o our father ampc yet when wee come to yeres we must haue a particular faith of our own no ma can be saued by anothers mans faith but by his own so it is said the iust shall liue by his faith but some will say this is not true for children must be saued by their parents faith the answer is this the faith of the parents doth bring the child to haue a title or interest to the couenant of grace and to all the benefits of christ but yet it doth not applie the benefits of christs death his obedience his merits and righteousnes vnto the infant for this the beleeuer doth only vnto himselfe amp to no other againe some may say if they doe not apprehend christs benefits by their parents faith how then is christs righteousnes made theirs answer by the inward working of the holy ghost who is the principall applier of all graces whereas faith is but the instrumet and this is true man of yeares are iustified by their own faith amp the infat by some other special working of god holy spirit furthermore to beleeue signifieth two things to conceiue or vnderstand any thing and withall to giue assent vnto it to be true and therefore in this place to beleeue signifieth to know and acknowledge that all the points of religion which followe are the truth of god here therefore we must remember that this clause i beleeue placed in the beginning of the creede must be particularly applied to euery article following for so the case stands that if faith faile in one maine point it faileth a man in all and therefore faith is said to be wholly copulatiue it is not sufficient to hold one article but he that will hold any of them for his good must hold them all and he which holdes them all in shewe of words if he ouerturne but one of them in deede he ouerturnes them all againe to beleeue is one thing amp to beleeue in this or that is another thing and it conteineth in it points or actions of a beleeuer to know a thing to acknowledge the same to put trust and confidence in it and in this order must these three actions of faith be applied to euery article following which concerneth god and herein is contained a speciall matter for alwaies by adding them to the words following we doe applie the article vnto our selues in a very comfortable manner as i beleeue in the father and doe beleeue that he is my father and therefore i put my whole trust in him and so of the rest now we come to the obiect of generall faith which is either god or the church in handling of both which i wil obserue this order i i will speake of the meaning of euery article ii of the duties which we ought to learn thereby iii and lastly of the consolations which may be gathered thence concerning god three things are to be considered and first by reason of manifold doubtings that rise in our minds it may be demanded whether there be a god many reasons might be vsed to resolue those that haue scruple of conscience otherwaies we are bound to beleeue that there is a god without al doubting as for those atheists which confidently auouch there is no god by god lawe they ought to die the death nay the earth is too good for such to dwell on malefactours as theeues and rebells for their offences haue their rewarde of death but the offence of those which denie that there is a god is greater and therefore deserues the most cruell death the second point followeth namely what god is answer moses desiring to see god face was not permitted but to see his hinder parts and therefore no man can be able to describe god by his nature but by his effects amp properties on this or such like maner god is an essence spirituall simple infinite most holy i say first of all that god is an essence to shew that he is a thing absolutely subsisting in himselfe amp by himselfe not receiuing his being from any other and herein he differeth fro all creatures whatsoeuer which haue subsisting amp beeing from him alone againe i say that he is an essence spirituall because hee is not a kinde of body neither hath he the parts of the body of me or other creatures but is in nature a spirit inuisible not subiect to any of mans senses i adde also that he is a simple essence because his nature admits no maner of composition of matter or forme or parts the creatures are compounded of diverse parts amp of varietie of nature but there is no such thing in god for whatsoeuer thing he is he is the same by one amp the same singular and indiuisible essence furthermore he is infinite and that diverse waies infinite in time without any beginning and without end infinite in place because he is euery where and excluded no where within all places and foorth of all places lastly he is most holy that is of infinite wisdome mercie loue grace goodnes ampc and he alone is rightly tearmed most holy because holinesse is of the very nature of god himselfe wheras among the most excellent creatures it is otherwise as for example a man is one thing and the holines of man is another thus we see what god is and to this effect god describes himself to be iehova elohim amp paul describes him to be a king euerlasting immorall inuisible amp onely wise to whom is due all honour amp glorie for euer the thirde point is touching the number of god namely whether there be more god then one or no ans there is not neither can there be any more god then one vvhich point the creede auoucheth in saying i beleeue in god not god and yet more plainly the nicene creede and the creede of athanasius both of them explaning the words of the apostles creede on this maner i beleeue in one god howsoeuer some in former times haue erroneously held that two god were the begining of all things one of good things the other of euill things others that there was one god in the old testament an other in the new others againe namely the valintinians that there were couple of god and the heathen people as augustine recordeth worshipped thousand god yet we that are members of god church must hold and beleeue one god alone amp no more deut vnderstand this day and consider in thine heart that iehovah he is god in heauen aboue and vpon the earth beneath there is none other ephesians one god one faith one baptisme if it be alleadged that the scripture mentioneth many god because psalm magistrates are called god exo moses is called aarons god corinthian the deuill and all idols are called god the answer is this they are not properly or by nature god for in that respect there is onely one god but they are so tearmed in other respects magistrates are god because they be vicegerents placed in the roome of the true god to gouerne their subiects moses is aarons god because he was in the roome of god to reueale his will to aaron the deuill is a god because the hearts of the wicked would giue the honour vnto him which is peculiar to the euerliuing god idols are called god because they are such in mens conceits and opinions who esteeme of them as of god therefore paul faith an idole is nothing in the worlde that is nothing in nature subsisting or nothing in respect of the diuinitie ascribed vnto it to proceede forwarde to beleeue in this one god is in effect thus much to knowe and acknowledge him as he hath reuealed himselfe in his worde to beleeue him to be my god from mine heart to put all mine affiance in him to this purpose christ saith this is eternall life to knowe thee the onely god and whome thou hast sent iesus christ nowe the knowledge here meant is not a bare or generall knowledge for that the deuills haue but a more speciall knowledge whereby i know god not onely to be god but also to be my god and thereupon doe put my confidence in him and thus much of the meaning of the first wordes i beleeue in god ampc nowe followe the duties which may be gathered hence first of all if wee are bound to beleeue in god then wee are also bound to take notice of our naturall vnbeliefe to checke our selues for it and to striue against it thus dealt the father of the childe that had a dumme spirite lord saith he j beleeue lorde helpe myne vnbeleefe and david why article thou cast dovvne my soule and why article thou so disquieted in me wayt on god and that which our sauiour christ said once to peter should a man say euery day to himselfe o thou of little faith why hast thou doubted but some may say wherein standes our vnbeleefe answer it standes in two thinges i in distrusting the goodnesse of god that is in giuing to little or no affiance to him or in putting affiance in the creature for the first fewe man will abide to be told of there distrust in god but in deede it is a common and rife corruption and though they soothe themselues neuer so yet their vsuall dealings proclaime their vnbeleefe goe thorough all places it shall be founde that scarce one of a thousand in his dealings makes conscience of a lie a great part of man gets their wealth by fraud and oppression and all kinde of vniust and vnmercifull dealing vvhat is the cause that they can doe so alas alas if there be any faith it is pinned vp in some by corner of the heart and vnbeleefe beares sway as the lorde of the house againe if a man had as much wealth as the world comes to he could finde in his heart to wish for an other and if he had two worldes he would be casting for the thirde if it might be compassed the cause hereof is man haue not learned to make god their portion and to stay their affections on him which if they could doe a meane portion in temporall blessings would be enough such man will not yeilde that they doe indeede distrust the lord vnlesse at some time they be touched in conscience vvith a sense of their sinnes and be thoroughly humbled for the same but indeede distrust of god goodnesse is a generall and a mother sinne the ground of all other sinnes and the very first and principall sinne in adams fall and for the second part of vnbeleefe which is an affiance in the creature reade the whole booke of god and we shall finde it a common sinne in all sorts of man some putting their trust in riches some in strength some in pleasures some placing their felicitie in one sinne some in an other vvhen king asa was sicke he put his trust in the phisitians and not in the lorde and in our daies the common practise is when crosses and calamities fall then there is trotting out to that wise man to this cunning woman to this sorcerer to that wisard that is from god to the deuill and their counsell is receiued and practised without any bones making and this shewes the bitter roote of vnbeleefe and confidence in vaine creatures let man smoothe it ouer with goodly tearmes as long as they will in a worde there is no man in the worlde be hee called or not called if he looke narrowly vnto himselfe hee shall finde his heart almost filled with manifolde doubtings and distrustings whereby hee shall feele him selfe euen carried away from beleeuing in god therefore the duetie of euery man is that vvill truely say that hee beleeues in god to labour to see his owne vnbeleefe and the fruits thereof in his life as for such as say they haue no vnbeleefe nor feele none more pitifull is their case for so much the greater is their vnbeleefe secondly considering that wee professe our selues to beleeue in god wee must euery one of vs learne to knowe god as paul saith hovv can they beleeue in him of vvhome they have not heard and hovve can they heare vvithout a preacher therefore none can beleeue in god but hee must first of all heare and be taught by the ministerie of the word to know god aright let this be remembred of young and olde it is not the pattering ouer of the beleefe for a prayer that will make a man a good beleeuer but god must be knowne of vs and acknowledged as hee hath reuealed him selfe partly in his worde and partly in his creatures blinde ignorance and the right vse of the apostles creede will neuer stande together therefore it stands man in hande to labour and takes paines to get knowledge in religion that knowing god aright they may come steadfastly to beleeue in him thirdly because wee beleeue in god therefore another duetie is to denie our selues vtterly and to become nothing in our selues our sauiour christ requires of vs to become as little children if wee would beleeue the begger dependes not on the releefe of others till he finde nothing at home and till our hearts be purged of selfe loue and pride wee can not depende on the fauour and goodnes of god therefore he that would trust in god must first of all be abased and confounded in him selfe and in regard of him selfe be out of all hope of attaining to the least sparke of the grace of god fourthly in that we beleeue in god and therefore put our whole trust and assurance in him wee are taught that euery man must commit his bodie his soule goods life yes all that hee hath into the handes of god and to his custodie so paul saith i am not ashamed of my sufferings for i knowe whome i haue beleeued and am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which i haue committed vnto him against that day a worthie saying for what is the thing which paul committed vnto the lorde surely his owne soule and the eternall saluation thereof but what mooues him to trust god surely his perswasion whereby hee knowes that god will keepe it and peter saith let them that suffer according to the vvill of god commit their soules to him in well doing as vnto a faithfull creatour looke as one friende layeth dovvne a thing to be kept of another so must a man giue all that hee hath to the custodie of god fevve or none can practise this and therefore vvhen any euill befalls them eyther in bodie or in goods or any other vvay then they shewe them selues rather beastes then man in impatience for in prosperitie they vvoulde not trust in god and therefore in aduersitie vvhen crosses come they are voyde of comfort but when a man hath grace to beleeue and trust in god then hee commits all into god handes and though all the worlde should perish yet hee would not be dismaide and vndoubtedly if a man will be thankefull for the preseruation of his goods or of his life hee must shewe the same by committing all he hath into god handes and suffer him selfe to be ruled by him nowe followes the consolations and comforts which god church and children reape hereby first he that beleeues in god and takes god for his god may assure him selfe of saluation and of a happie deliuerance in all daungers and necessities when god threatned a plague vpon israel for their idolatry good king iosiah humbled him selfe before the lorde and he was safe all his daies and so king hezekiah when senacherib the king of ashur offered to inuade iudah he trusted in the lorde and praied vnto him and was deliuered vvhereby we see if a man trust in god he shall haue securitie and quietnesse as iehosaphat saide to the man of iudah and our sauiour christ when he was vpon the crosse and felt the whole burden of the wrath of god vpon him cryed my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and it appeareth in the epistle to the hebrewes that christ was heard in that he feared whereby we are giuen to vnderstand that they shall neuer be vtterly forsaken that take god for their god and king dauid hauing experience of this vseth most excellent speaches for this ende to shewe that the ground of his comfort was that god was his god and it is said that daniel had no manner of hurte in the lyons denne because hee trusted in the lorde his god and contrariwise such as distrust god are subiect to all miseries and iudgements the israelites in the wildernesse beleeved not god and trusted not in his helpe therefore god vvas angry and his fire vvas kindled in iacob and vvrath came vpon israel god the father almightie some haue thought that these wordes are to be coupled with the former without distinction as if the title of god had bene proper to the first person the father and not common to the rest and thus haue some heretikes thought but indeed there must a pause or distinction be made that the name or title of god may be set in the fore front as common to all the three persons following for that is the very intent of the order of this creed to teach vs to beleeue in one god who is distinct into three subsistances or persons called the father the son the holy ghost and here offers it selfe to be considered euen one of the greatest mysteries of our religion namely that god is the father the son and the holy ghost and againe that the father the son and the holy ghost are one and the same god some at the first may possibly say that this cannot stande because it is against all reason that one should be three or three one the answere is that indeed if one and the same respect be kept it is not possible but in diverse considerations and respectes it may and thus the father the son amp the holy ghost are three namely in person and againe they three are one not in person but in nature by nature is meant a thing subsisting by it selfe that is common to many as the substance of man consisting of body and soule common to all man which we call the humanity of a man is the nature of man by person is meant a thing or essence subsisting by it selfe not common to many but incommunicable as among man these particulars peter john paul are called persons and so in the mysterie of the trinity the diuine nature is the godhead it selfe simply and absolutely considered and a person is that which subsisteth in this godhead as the father the son the holy ghost or againe a person is one and the same godhead not absolutely considered but in relation and as it were restrained by personall or caracteristicall proprieties as the godhead or god begetting is the father god againe considered not simply but so farre foorth as he is begotten is the son and god proceeding of the father and the son the holy ghost and if any man would conceiue in mind rightly the divine nature he must conceiue god or the godhead absolutely if any of the persons then he must conceiue the same godhead relatiuely with personal proprieties thus the godhead considered with the propriety of fatherhood or begetting is the father amp coceiuing the same godhead with the proprietie of generation we conceiue the son amp the godhead with the proprietie of proceeding amp we conceiue the holy ghost neither must it seeme strange to any that we use the names of nature and person to set forth this misterie by for they haue bene taken up by common consent in the primitive church amp that upon weighty consideration to manifest the truth amp to stop the mouthes of heretikes amp they are not used against the proper sense of the scriptures nay they are therein heb gal contained thus wee see how it comes to passe that the three things signified by these names father sone holy ghost are ech of them one amp the same god and this mistery may well be conceived by a coparison borowed fro light the light of the sun the light of the moone amp the light of the aire for nature and substance are one amp the same light amp yet they are distinct lights the light of the sun being of it selfe amp from none the light of the moone from the sun amp the light of the aire fro them both so the divine nature is one and the persons are three subsisting after a diverse maner in one and the same nature and for the further clearing of the point we must yet further marke amp remember two things namely the vnion amp the distinction of the persons the vnion is whereby three persons are one not simply but one in nature that is coessentiall or consubstantiall having all one godhead for the father is god the son is god amp the holy ghost is god now there are not distinct god but one god because there is one god amp no more in nature considering that the thing which is infinite is but one amp is not subiect to multiplicatio amp the father is this one god as also the son and the holy ghost and as these three persons are one in nature so whatsoeuer agrees to god simply considered agrees to them all three they are all coequall and coeternall all most wise iust mercifull omnipotent by one amp the same wisdome iustice mercie power and because they haue all one godhead therfore they are not only one with another but also ech in other the father in the son amp and the son in the father and the holy ghost in them both and we must not imagine that these three are one god as though the father had one part of the godhead the son an other part amp the holy ghost a third for that is most false because the infinite and the most simple godhead is not subiect to composition or division but euery person is whole god subsisting not in a part but in the whole godhead amp the whole entire godhead is communicated from the father to the son amp from both father amp son to the holy ghost but some may yet say that this doctrine seemes to be impossible because three creatures as for example peter paul timothy being three persons amp so remaining cannot haue one and the same nature that is the same body amp the same soule ans three or moe me may haue the same nature specie in kind but the truth is they cannot possibly haue a nature which shalbe one amp the same numero in number in them all three for a man is a substance created amp finite amp the body of man are quantities amp therfore divisible amp separable one from another hereupon it comes that the persons of man are not only distinguished by proprieties but also divided amp sundred one from another and though peter paul timothy haue all one common amp universall forme yet they three are not one man but man now it is otherwise with the divine nature or godhead which is uncreated and infinite and therefore admittes neither composition nor division but a distinction without any separation so as the three persons subsisting in it shall not be three god but one and the same god yet further some will obiect that it is truly said of the father that hee is god but the same godhead is not in the son nor in the holy ghost for the son and the holy ghost haue their beginning from the father ansvver the son and the holy ghost haue not a beginning of their nature or of their godhead from the father but of their person only the person of the son is from the father and the person of the holy ghost is both from the father and from the son but the godhead of all three persons is vncreate and vnbegotten and proceeding from none yet some may say both the son and the holy ghost haue receiued from the father all their attributes as wisedome knowledge power ampc now he that receiueth any thing from another is in that respect inferiour to him that giueth it and therefore the son and the holy ghost are not god as he is ans we must know that which the sone receiueth of the father he receiueth it by nature and not by grace amp he receiueth not a part but all that the father hath saving the personall proprietie and the holy ghost receiueth from the father and the son by nature and not by grace and therefore though both the son and the holy ghost receiue from the father yet they are not inferiour to him but equall with him and thus much is necessarie to be learned of the vnion betweene the three persons in trinitie whereby they being three haue all one and the same godheade the second point to be considered is that though these three haue but one godhead and all make but one god yet they are distinguished one from another for the father is the father and not the son nor the holy ghost the son is the son and not the father nor the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the holy ghost not the father nor the son this distinction of the persons is notably set forth vnto vs in the baptism of our saviour christ where it is said that vvhen iesus was baptized hee came out of the vvater there is the second person and the holy ghost descended upon him in the forme of a dove there is the thirde person and the father the first person pronounced from heauen that hee was his beloved son in whome hee was well pleased and we must not conceiue this distinction in such manner as though these three father son and holy ghost were three names of one god for the three persons doe not in name or word but really in truth distinctly subsist in the same divine nature neither must we imagine that the three persons are three formes or differences of one god as some heretikes haue dreamed who taught that the father alone is god and that he is called a father in one respect the son in another and the holy ghost in a thirde for this were nothing else but to make the personall proprieties to be nothing but imaginarie accidents which indeede or at the least in mans conceit might come and goe and be either in the persons or foorth of them for the personall relations though in minde they may be distinguished from the divine essence yet indeede they are one with it but some will say if they make this distinction there is rather a quaternitie then a trinitie for the godhead is one the father an other the son a third and the holy ghost a fourth thus some heretikes haue obiected against the distinction of the trinitie but it is untrue which they say for the godhead must not be severed from the father nor fro the son nor fro the holy ghost for the father is god or the whole godhead so also is the son and the holy ghost and the godhead likewise is in euery one of these three persons and euery one of them subsisting in the godhead and the godhead must be conceived to be in them all and not as a fourth thing out of them and therefore we must still maintaine that these persons are distinguished and not deuided as three man are deuided in being and substance for this division can not be in them because all three haue one divine nature and one godhead this is the misterie of all misteries to be receiued of us all namely the trinitie of the persons in the vnitie of the godhead this doctrine must be reteined and holden for these causes i because by it we are able to distinguish this true god from all false god and idols ii because among all other pointes of religion this is one of the chiefest being the verie foundation thereof for it is not sufficient for us to know god as we can conceiue of him in our owne imagination but we must know him as he hath revealed him selfe in his worde and it is not sufficient to saluation to beleeue in god confusedly but we must beleeue in one god distinct into three persons the father the son the holy ghost yes amp more then this we must hold amp beleeue that god the father is our father the son our redeemer the holy ghost our sanctifier amp comforter well then if we must in this maner beleeue in god then we must also know him for vve can haue no faith in the thing which is utterly unknown wherfore if we would beleeue in the father son or holy ghost we must know them in part ioh this is life eternall to know thee the only god and whome thou hast sent iesus christ ioh the world can not receiue the spirite of truth because it hath neither seene him nor knowen him ioh whosoever denieth the son hath not the father thirdly this doctrine directs us in worshipping god aright for vnitie in trinitie amp trinitie in vnitie is to be worshipped one god must be worshipped in the father in the son and in the holy ghost amp if we worship god the father without the son amp the holy ghost or if we worshippe the son without the father and the holy ghost and the holy ghost without the father amp the son we worship nothing but an idol againe if we worship the persons not as one god but as three god then likewise we make three idols note further that of all the three persons the first person the father is set in the first place and is described to us by three things i by his title that he is a father ii by his attribute that hee is almightie iii by his effect that hee is maker of heaven and earth of these in order as they lye in the creede and first of the title father it may seeme that he hath some prerogatiue over the son and the holy ghost because he is set before them but we must know he is set before them neither in regard of time nor of dignitie for therein all three are equall but in regarde of order onely the father is the first the son the second and the holy ghost the third as may appeare by this similitude if three emperours equall in dignity should meete all in one place beeing equall also in power and maiestie if all three should sit dovvne though one be no better then an other yet one of them must needes sit downe the first and another in the seconde place and then the thirde but yet wee can not say that he which sate downe first is the chiefest and so it is in the trinitie though none be greater or above another yet the father is in the first place not because he is before the son or the holy ghost in dignitie or honour but because he is the fountaine of the deitie the son being from him and the holy ghost from them both nowe let us come to the title of the first person the name father in scriptures is ascribed either to god taken indefinitely and so by consequente to all the three persons in trinitie or particularly to the first person alone for the first god is a father properly and principally according to the saying of christ call no man father vpon earth for there is but one your father vvhich is in heaven that is mat principally whereas earthly parentes whome wee are commaunded to worship and honour are but certaine images or resemblances of our heavenly father having this blessing that they are fathers from him and hereupon this title agrees in man not simply but so farre forth as god honoureth them with fatherhoode in calling them to be fathers whereas god himselfe receiues this honour from none god is tearmed a father in respect both of nature and grace hee is a father in regard of nature because hee created and gouerneth all things in this regard hee is called the heb father of spirits and luke adam is called the son of god hee is a father in respect of grace because wee are regenerate by him and accepted to be his sonnes by adoption thorough the merite of christ and in this respect the second person as well as the first is called isaiah a father and saide to haue an offspring isaiah or seede and isaiah children but when the name of father is giuen to the first person is done upon a speciall consideration because he is a father by nature to the seconde person begetting him of his owne substance before all worldes by this it appeares that out of the title of the first person wee may fetch a description thereof on this maner the father is the first person in trinitie begetting the son nowe to beget is the personall proprietie whereby he is distinguished from the other two if it be said that the creatures doe beget amp that therefore to beget is not proper to the father the answere is that in this point there are many differences betweene god the father amp all creatures first the father begets the son before all eternitie and therefore god the father begetting and the son begotten are equall in time whereas in earthly generation the father is before the son in time secondly god the father begets his son by communicating unto him his whole essence or godhead which can not be in earthly parents unlesse they should be abolished and come to nothing vvhereas neuerthelesse god the father giuing his whole nature to his son retaines the same still because it is infinite thirdly the father begetts the son in himselfe amp not forth of himselfe but in earthly generation the father begetting is forth of the child and the child forth of the father and that must not trouble vs which heretikes alledge against this doctrine namely that if the father who is of one nature with the son did beget the son then hee did beget himselfe for the godhead of the father doth not beget either the godhead or the person of the son but the person of the father begets the person of the son both which in one godhead are really distinct thus we see what the father is nowe to beleeue in the father is to be perswaded that the first person in trinity is the father of christ and in him my father particularly and that for this cause i entend amp desire for euer to put my trust in him the duties which wee may learne hence are manifolde and here we haue occasion offered first of all to consider who is our father by nature i shall say to corruption saieth iob thou article my father and to the worme thou article my mother seeing god vouchsafeth this great prerogatiue to them that loue him that he vvill be their father therefore iob in consideration hereof would haue euery man to haue recourse to his owne naturall condition to see who is his father by nature iob saith corruption is his father but if we mark the condition of our nature we shall further see euery man is by nature the child of wrath and that sathan is his father for so long as a man walkes in his sinnes which euery man doth by nature so long doth he shew himselfe to be the liuely child of the deuill and thus christ reasoneth against the scribes and pharises yee are of your father the deuill and the lustes of your father ye will doe and true it is that no childe is so like his father that begat him as euerie man by nature is like the deuill and the whole tenour and course of his naturall life without grace is a liuely resemblance of the disposition of satan secondly euery one that beleeves god to be a father and in christ his father must as a good child be obedient to his fathers will so salomon saith a vvise son maketh a glad father how by doing his will and therefore when one tolde our sauiour christ that his mother and breethren stoode vvithout desiring to speake with him he saide vvhosoever shall doe my fathers vvill vvhich is in heaven the same is my father my sister and mother where vvee may note that hee that will haue god the father to be his father and christ iesus his brother must doe the will of god the father and hence god saith if i be a master vvhere is my feare if i be a father vvhere is my honour vvhere is plainely taught this seconde duety that if god be our father then as good children vvee must shevve obedience unto him but if vvee be disobedient vnto him then vve must knowe that that former saying of christ will be verefied vpon vs that because man doe the lustes of the devill therefore they are the children of the deuill but least this fearefull sentence be verefied of vs it is the duety of euerie man that maketh this confession that hee beleeues god to be his father first to labour to knovve god will and secondly to perfourme continuall obedience unto the same like unto a good childe that would faine please his father and therefore is alwaies ready to do the best he can and without doubt that man which unfainedly takes god for his father is then most grieued when as by any sinne he displeaseth him amp no other crosse or calamity is so grieuous unto him the greatest grief that the prodigall son had was that he had offeded his father by sinning against heaue amp against him the same also must be our griefe and all our care set on this how we may be obedient children to this our louing father thirdly that ma that beleeues god to be his father must imitate and follow him for it is the will of god that his children should be like vnto himselfe now we follow god especially in things i in doing good to them that persecute vs so saith our sauiour christ pray for them that hurt you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for hee maketh the sun to rise on the evill and on the good and sendeth raine on the iust and uniust ii our heavenly father is mercifull for he is a father of the fatherlesse and therefore he that will be a son of this father must be mercifull to his poore breethren as iob saith of himselfe i vvas the eyes to the blind amp i vvas the feete unto the lame i vvas a father unto the poore fourthly seeing wee beleeue god to be our father we are hereby taught onely to vse moderate care for the things of this life for if a man know himselfe to be the child of god then he also knowes that god will provide for him as wee know in a family the father provideth for all now god is a father and his church is his family therefore if thou wilt be a meber of god church amp a child of god thou must cast thy care on god amp follow the counsell of christ be not to carefull for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink and mark his reason drawen from the point which we haue in hand the fowles of the heauen saith he they neither sow nor reape nor carrie into barnes and yet your heavenly father feedeth them are not ye much better then they but alas the practise of the worlde is contrarie for man haue no care for the knowledge of god worde nor the meanes of their salvation all their mindes are set on the things of this life when as christ saith first seeke the kingdome of heaven and the righteousnesse thereof and all these things shall be ministred vnto you if you shoulde see a young man provide for himselfe and no man else for him wee woulde say surely his father is deade euen so when a mans care is set wholly both day and night for the things of this life it argues that god hath either cast him off or else that he takes him for no father of his fiftly if god he our father then wee must learne to beare any crosse patiently that he shall lay upon us either in bodie or in minde and alwaies looke for deliverance from him for whome the lorde loueth them hee chastiseth and if yee endure chastising saith the apostle god offereth himselfe unto you as vnto children which may appeare more plainly by this comparison if two children shoulde fight and a man comming by shoulde parte them and after beate the one and let the other goe free euerie man that seeth this will say that that childe which hee beates is his owne son euen so when god chastiseth vs he shevveth himselfe unto us as a father if we submit our selues nowe if our earthly fathers corrected us and we gaue them reverence taking it patiently should vve not much rather be in subiection to the father of spirits that wee may liue therefore the conclusion is this if we displease god be ye sure he will correct us amp when his hand is upon us we must not murmure against him but beare it with a milde spirite and furthermore when vvee are under the crosse we must alwaies looke for deliverance from this our father onely if a son vvhen hee is beaten should flee to his fathers enemy for helpe and counsell it woulde argue that hee were but a gracelesse childe sundry and diverse calamities and crosses befall man in this life which they can not brooke and therefore it is a common practise of many among us in these dayes vvhen god hande is upon them to goe for helpe to the deuill they seeke for counsell at witches and vvise man as i haue said but let them looke unto it for that is the right vvay to double their miserie and to shewe themselues levvde children lastly if wee confesse and beleeue god to be the father of christ and in him our father also then in regarde of our conuersation wee must not frame our selves like unto the world but the course of our liues must be in righteousnesse and true holinesse paul exhorteth the corinthians to separate themselues from idolaters alledging the place out of the olde testament where the lorde biddeth the israelites to come out from idolaters and to touch no vncleane thing and the reason followeth out of ieremie that if they doe so then god vvill be their father and they shall be his children even his sonnes and daughters which reason paul vrgeth in the next chapter to this effect considering wee haue these promises that therefore wee shoulde cleanse our selues from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirite and growe up unto holines in the feare of the lorde where if wee marke the place diligently wee shall finde this lesson that euerie man who takes god for his father must not onely in this sinne of idolatry but in all other sinnes separate himselfe that man by his godly life may knowe whose childe he is but some will say this exhortation is needlesse amongst vs for wee haue no cause to separate our selues from others because all amongst vs are christians all beleeve in god and are baptised and hope to be saved by christ ansvver in outvvard profession i confesse wee carrie the shewe of christians but in deede and trueth by our lives and conversations very many among vs denie christ for in euerie place the common practise is to spende the time in drunkennesse and surfetting in chambering and wantonnesse yes great is the company of those that make a trade of it take this conversation from many man and take away their liues and on the lordes day it may bee seene both publiquely and priuately in houses and in the open streetes there is such reuell as though there were no god to serve in the sixe dayes of the weeke manie man vvalke verie painefully in their callings but when the lordes day commeth then every man takes license to doe what hee will and because of the princes lawes man will come formally to the church for fashions sake but in the meane time how many do nothing else but scorne mocke and deride and as much as in them lieth disgrace both the worde and the ministers thereof so that the comon saying is this oh he is a precise fellow he goes to heare sermons he is too holy for our copanie but it stands man in hand to take out a better lesson which is if we will haue god to be our father wee must shewe our selues to be the children of god by repentance and newnesse of life he can not be but a gracelesse child that will lead a rebellious life flat against his fathers minde let us then so behaue our selves that we may honour our father which is in heauen and not dishonour him in our liues and callings rather let us separate our selues from the filthinesse of the flesh loathing those things which our father lotheth and fleeing from those things which our father abhorreth and thus much for the duties now follow the consolations which arise from this point but first we are to know that there are three sortes of man in the world the first are such as will neither heare nor obey the word of god the second sort are those which will heare the word preached vnto them but they will not obey both these sortes of man are not to looke for any comfort hence now there is a third sort of man which as they heare god worde so they make conscience of obeying the same in their liues and callings and these are they to whome the consolations that arise out of this place doe rightly belong and must be applyed unto first therefore seeing god the father of christ and in him the father of all that obey and doe his will is our father here note the dignitie and prerogative of all true beleeuers for they are sonnes and daughters of god as saith s john so many as received him to them he gaue a prerogatiue to be the sonnes of god even to them that beleeve in his name this priviledge will appeare the greater if we consider our first estate for as abraham saith we are but dust and ashes and in regard of the deprauation of our natures we are the children of the deuill therefore of such rebels to be made the sonnes of god it is a wonderfull priviledge and prerogative amp no dignitie like unto it and to enlarge it further he that is the son of god is the brother of christ amp fellow heire with him and so heire apparant to the kingdom of heauen and in this respect is not inferiour to the verie angels this must be laid vp carefully in the hearts of god people to confirme them in their conversation among the company of vngodly man in this world secondly if a man doe indeauour himselfe to walke according to god worde then the lord of his mercie will beare with his wants for as a father spareth his owne son so will god spare them that feare him now a father commaunds his child to write or to apply his booke though all things herein be not done according to his mind yet if he find a readinesse with a good indeavour he is content and falls to praise his childs writing or learning so god giueth his commandement and though his servant faile in obedience yet if the lord see their heartie indeavour and their vnfeigned willingnesse to obey his will though with sundry wants hee hath made this promise and will performe it that as a father spareth his son so will he spare them if a child be sicke will the father cast him off nay if thorough the grievousnesse of his sicknesse he can not take the meat that is giuen him or if he take it amp for faintnesse pick it up againe will the father of the childe thrust him out of dores no but he will rather pitie him and so when a man doth indeauour himselfe through the whole course of his life to keepe god commandements god will not cast him away though through weakenesse he faile in sundry things and displease god this prerogatiue can none haue but he that is the child of god as for others when they sinne they doe nothing else but draw downe god iudgements upon them for their deeper condemnation thirdly hence we learne that the childe of god can not wholly fall away from god fauour i doe not say that hee can not fall at all for he may fall away in part but hee can not wholly and so oft as he sinnes he depriues himselfe in part of god fauour david loued his son absolon wonderfully but absolon like a wicked son played a lewde pranck amp would haue thrust his father out of his kingdom and david although he was sore offended with absolon amp shewed tokens of his wrath yet in heart he loued him and neuer purposed to cast him off hereupon when he went against him he commanded the captaines to intreat the yong man absolon gently for his sake and when he was hanged by the haire of the head in pursuing his father then david wept and cried o my son absolon my son absolon would god i had dyed with thee absolon my son and so it is with god our heauenly father when his children sinne against him and thereby loose his loue and fauour and fall from grace he forsakes them but how farre surely he shewes signes of anger for their wickednesse amp yet indeed his loue remaines towards them still and this is a true conclusion the grace of god in the adoptio of the elect is unchageable amp he that is the childe of god can neuer fall away wholly or finally on the contrary that is a bad and comfortlesse opinion of the church of rome which holdeth that a man may be iustified before god and yet afterward by a mortall sinne finally fall from grace and be condemned fourthly the child of god that takes god the father for his father may freely come into the presence of god amp haue liberty to pray unto him we know it is a great priviledge to come into the chamber of presence before an earthly prince and fewe can alwaies haue this prerogatiue though they be great man yet the kings owne son may haue free entrance amp speake freely vnto the king himselfe because he is his son now the children of god haue more prerogative then this for they may come into the chamber of presence not of an earthly king but of almightie god the king of kings and as they are the sonnes of god in christ so in him they may freely speake unto god their father by prayer and this ouerthrowes the doctrine of such as be of the church of rome which teach and hold that a man must come to speake to god by prayer through the intercession of saintes for say they the presence of god is so glorious that we may not be so bolde as of our selues to speake unto him but needs must haue the intercession of others lastly god will provide for all his church and children all things needfull both for their body and soules so our sauiour christ bids his disciples take no thought what they should eate or what they shold drinke or wherewith they should be clothed adding this reason for your heavenly father knovveth all your vvants and if we take thought it must be moderate and not distrustfull it is a part of the fathers dutie to provide for his family and children and not the children for the father now shall an earthly father haue this care for his children and shall not our heauenly father much more provide for those that feare and loue him nay marke further in god church there be many hypocrites which receiue infinite benefites from god by reason of his elect children with whome they liue and we shall see this to be true that the wicked man hath ever fared better for the godly mans cause sodome and gommorrha receiued many benefites by reason of righteous lot and when the lord was purposed to destroy sodome he was faine to pull lot forth of the citie for the text saith the angell of the lorde coulde not doe any thing till he vvas come out of it so also in pauls daungerous voyage towardes rome all the man in it fared better for pauls company for the lord told paul by an angel that there should be no losse of any mans life for the lord had given to him all that sailed with him and undoubtedly if it were not for some few that feare god hee would poure downe his vengeance upon many nation and kingdomes there is such excesse of wickednesse in all sortes againe if the lord doe thus carefully provide for his children all kind of benefites what a wonderfull wickednesse is this for man to get their liuing by ungodly meanes as vsurie carding dicing and such like exercises if a man were perswaded that god were his father and would provide sufficiently both for his body and soule so that using lawful meanes he should euer haue enough out of all doubt hee woulde neuer after the fashion of the world use unlawful and profane meanes to get a liuing but this prooveth that howsoeuer such man say god is their father yet indeede they deny him and thus much of this title father the first thing whereby the first person is described now followeth the second point namely his attribute of omnipotencie in this worde almightie and whereas the father is saide to be almightie it is not so to be vnderstood as though the son were not almightie or the holy ghost not almightie for euery propertie and attribute saue the personall properties is comon to all the three persons for as god the father doth impart his godhead vnto the son and to the holy ghost so also he doeth communicate the proprieties thereof to them god is omnipotent two waies i because he is able to doe whatsoeuer he will ii because he is able to doe more then he will doe for the first that god is able to doe whatsoeuer he will dauid saith our god is in heauen and he doth whatsoeuer he will for there is nothing that can hinder god but as he willeth so euery thing is done secondly that god can doe more then hee willeth to be done it is plaine where john baptist saith god is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto abraham though god can doe this thing yet he will not doe it so likewise when christ was betraied the father could haue giuen him more then legions of angels to haue deliuered him out of their hands but yet he would not and the like may be said of many other things the father is amp was able to haue created another world yes a thousand worlds but he would not nor will not and likewise christ beeing vpon the crosse was able at their bidding to haue come downe and saued himselfe from death but he would not and therefore this is true the lord can doe any thing that he willeth to be done actually yes and more then he will but some will say god can not doe some things which man can doe as god can not lie nor denie himselfe and therefore he is not omnipotent answer although some haue thought god could doe these things and that he did them not because he would not yet we must knowe and beleeue that god can neither lie nor denie himselfe indeede man can doe both but these and many other such things if he could doe them he could not be god god indeede can doe all things which shewe foorth his glorie and maiestie but such things as are against his nature he can not doe as for example god can not sinne and therefore can not lie and because he can not doe those things therefore he is omnipotent for these and such like are workes of impotencie which if god could doe he were but an impotent god secondly he can not doe that which implies contradiction as when a thing is to make it at the same time to be and not to be as when the sun doth shine to make it at the same instant to shine and not to shine and therefore false is the doctrine of the church which in their transubstantiation make the body of christ whose essetiall propertie is to be only in one place at once to be circumscribed and not to be circumscribed to be in one place and not to be in one place and thus much for the meaning now follow the dueties wherunto we are mooued by this doctrine of god omnipotencie first whereas god the father is said to be almightie we are taught true humiliation humble your selues vnder the mightie hand of god saith peter where he giueth an exhortation to humilitie amp alledgeth the cause because god is almightie to make this more plaine euery one of vs was borne in sinne and by nature we are most wretched in our selues nowe what an one is god surely he is able to doe whatsoeuer he will yes and more then he will and is able to destroy such as rebell against him euery moment therefore our duetie is to cast downe our selues for our sinnes in his presence this true humiliation was that which our sauiour christ would haue brought the young man in the gospell vnto when he bad him goe sell all that he had and giue to the poore therfore whosoeuer thou article take heede thou must for if thou runne on in thy wickednes and still rebell against god it is a thousand to one at length he will destroy thee for he is an almightie god and able to doe whatsoeuer he will his hand is mightie it boots not a man to striue with him for he was neuer yet ouermastered and for this cause we must needes cast downe our selues vnder his hand it is a fearefull thing saith the holy ghost to fall into the hands of the liuing god therefore if we would escape his heauie amp terrible displeasure the best way for vs is to abase our selues and be ashamed to follow our sinnes christ biddeth vs not to feare him that is able to kill the bodie and can goe no further but we must feare him that is able to cast both bodie and soule into hell fire example of this we haue in david who when he was persecuted by his owne son absalon he said vnto the lord if he thus say j haue no delite in thee behold here i am let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eyes but some will say i will liue a little longer in my sinnes in lying pride sabbath breaking in swearing dicing gaming and wantonnes for god is mercifull and in my olde age i will repent answer well soothe not thy selfe but marke vsually when god holds back his hand for a season he doth as it were fetch a more mightie blow for the greater confusion of a rebellious sinner therefore humble submit and cast downe thy selfe before god and doe not striue against him his hand is mightie and will ouerthrow thee though thou hadst all learning wisdome might riches ampc yet as christ said to the young man one thing is wanting that thou shouldest be humbled amp vntill thou be hubled nothing is to be looked for but god iudgement for sinne secondly seeing god is almightie we must tremble and feare at all his iudgements wee muste stand in awe quake and quiuer at them as the poore child doth when he seeth his father come with the rodde example of this we haue often in god word as when the sonnes of aaron offered strange fire before the lord he sent fire from heauen and burned them vp nowe aaron he was very sorie for his sonnes but when moses told him that the lord would be glorified in all that came neare him then the text aith aaron held his peace so also wee reade that the apostles reprooued peter for preaching vnto the gentiles but when peter had expounded the things in order which he had seene then they helde their peace and glorified god as also dauid saith i h ld my tongue o lord because thou didst it isaiah saith in hope amp silence is true fortitude if a man be in trouble he must hope for deliuerance and be quiet and patient at god iudgements but the practise of the world is flat contrarie for man are so farre from trembling at them that they will pray to god that plagues curses and vengeance may light vpon them and vpon their seruan s and children now the lord beeing a mightie god often doth answearably bring his iudgements vpon them againe many carried with impaciencie wish themselues hanged or drowned which euils they thinke shall neuer befall them yet at the length god doth in his iustice bring such punishments vpon them nay further in all ages there are some which doe scorne and mocke at god iudgements hereof wee had not farre hence a most fearefull example one beeing with his companion in a house drink on the lord day when he was readie to depart thence there was great lightning and thunder whereupon his fellow requested him to stay but the man mocking and iesting at the thunder and lightning said as report was it was nothing but a knaue cooper knocking on his tubbs come what would he would goe and so went on his iourney but before he came halfe a mile from the house the same hand of the lorde which before he had mocked in a cracke of thunder stroke him about the girdlestead that he fell downe starke dead which example is worthie our remembrance to put vs in minde of god heauie wrath against those which scorne his iudgements for our duetie is to tremble and feare and it were greatly to be wished that we could with open eye beholde the terriblenesse and fearefulnesse of god iudgements it would make a man to quake and to leaue off sinne if a man passe by some high and daungerous place in the night when he cannot see he is not afraid but if yee bring him backe againe in the day and let him see what a stiepe and daungerous way he came he will not be brought to goe the same way againe for any thing so it is in sinning for man liuing in ignorance and blindnes practise any wickednes and do not care for god iudgements but when god of his goodnes bringeth them backe and openeth their eyes to see the downefall to the pit of hell and the iudgements of god due to their sinnes then they say they will neuer sinne as they haue done but become newe man and walke in the way to eternall life thirdly we are taught by the apostle paul that if we be to doe any dutie to our brother as to releeue them we must doe it with chearefulnesse for hee laboureth to perswade the corinthians to cherefull liberalitie and the reason of his perswasion is because god is able to make all grace to abound towards them where also this duetie is taught vs that seeing god is omnipotent and therefore able to make vs abound therefore we must giue cherefully to our poore brother which want fourthly whereas there are many in euery place which haue liued long in their sinnes eue from their cradle some in wantonnesse some in drunkennes some in swearing some in idlenes and such like out of this place to all such there is a good lesson namely that euery one of them doe nowe become new man and repent of all their sinnes for all their life past for marke what paul saith of the iewes which cut off from christ through vnbeleefe amp haue so continued in hardnes of heart and desperate malice against him almost hundreth yeares if saith he they abide not still in vnbeleefe they may be grafted into their oliue again and his reason is this because god is able to graft them in againe euen so though we haue liued many yeres in sinne and sure it is a dangerous and fearefull case for a man to liue or yeres vnder the power of the deuill yet we must know that if we wil now liue a new life forsake all our sinnes amp turne to god we may be receiued to grace amp be made a branch of the true oliue though we haue borne the fruits of the wild oliue all our life long but some will obiect that they haue no hope of god fauour because they haue beene so grieuous sinners and continued in them so long answer but know it whosoeuer thou article god is able to graft thee in amp if thou repent he will receiue thee to his loue amp fauour this must be obserued of all but especially of such as are olde in yeares and yet remaine ignorant without knowledge they must turne to the lorde by repentance otherwise if they continue still profane and wicked they must knowe this that their damnation comes post hast to meete them and they to it and thus much for the dueties nowe followe the consolations which god church reape from this that god the father is omnipotent first the wonderfull power of god serueth to strengthen vs in prayer vnto god for he that will pray truly must onely pray for those things for which he hath warrant in god word all our prayers must be made in faith and for a man to pray in faith it is harde therefore a speciall meanes to strengthen vs herein is the mightie power of god this was the ground and stay of the leaper whome our sauiour christ clensed lord saith he if thou wilt thou canst make me cleane and in the lord prayer when our sauiour christ hath taught vs to make sixe petitions in the ende he giueth vs a reason or motiue to induce vs to stand vpon and to wait for the benefits before craved in these words thine is the kingdome thine is the power ampc secondly hence we learne this comfort that all the gates of hell shal neuer be able to preuaile against the least meber of christ i doe not say they shal neuer be able to assault or tempt them for that may be but they shall neuer ouercome them how will some say may we be resolued of this i answer by reason of faith for if a christian man do beleeue that god the father and in christ his father is almightie no enemie shall euer be able to preuaile against him so s john reasoneth little children yee are of god and haue ouercome them that is all false teachers because greater is he that is in you that is christ iesus by his holy spirite who is god and therefore almightie then he that is in the worlde that is the spirit of sathan therefore you neede not to feare so dauid compareth him selfe to a sillie sheepe and saith though i should walke through the valley of the shadow of death that is as it were in the mouth of the lyo yet i will feare none evill why so because the lord is with him thy rodde saith he and thy staffe comfort me thus much for the benefits now whereas it is saide the first person is a father as also almightie ioyne these two together and hence will arise singular benefits and instructions first whereas we are taught to confesse that the first person is a father almightie we and euery man must learne to haue experience in himselfe of the mightie power of this almightie father why will some say that is nothing for the devil and all the damned soules feele the power of the almightie true in deede they feele the power of god namely as he is an almightie iudge condemning them but they feele not the power of an almightie father this is the point whereof we must learne to haue experience in our selues paul prayeth that the god of our lord iesus christ the father of glorie would giue vnto the ephesians the spirite of wisdome to see what is the exceeding greatnes of his power in them which beleeue according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ which place must be cosidered for here the apostle would haue vs haue such a speciall manifestation of god power in our selues like to that which he did once shew forth in christ but how did christ see and find the power of god as he was man answer diverse waies i on the crosse he died the first death which is the separation of bodie and soule and he suffered the sorrowes of the second death for in his soule he bare the whole wrath of god and all the panges of hell and after was buried and laide in the graue where death triumphed ouer him for the space of three daies now in this extremitie god did shew his power in that he raised christ from death to life and looke as his power was manifested in christ the head so must it be manifested in all his members for euery man hath his graue which is naturall sinne and corruption which we draw from our first parents and looke as a man lies dead in the graue and can mooue neither hand nor foote so euery man by nature lieth dead in sinne now as god did shewe his power in raising christ from death so euery one must labour to haue this knowledge and experience in him selfe of the mightie power of god in raising him from the graue of sinne to newnes of life for thus paul makes a speciall request that he might knowe christ and the vertue of his resurrection that is that he might feele in him selfe that power whereby christ was raised from death to life to raise him also from the bondage of his sinnes to a new life more amp more furthermore whe christ was vpon the crosse and all the gates of hell were open against him then did hee vanquish sathan he bruised the serpents head and as paul saith he spoiled principality and powers and made a shew of them openly and hath triumphed ouer them in the crosse he ouercame the deuill and all his angels by the power of his almightie father and by his owne power as he is god and euen so must christian man labour to finde the same power in themselues of this almightie father by which christ did triumph ouer sathan that by it they may tread him vnder their feete which man can neuer doe by any power in themselues againe christ praieth that that cuppe might passe from him and yet he saith not my will but thy will be fulfilled for it was necessarie that christ should suffer and this request was heard not because he was freed from death but because god his father almightie gaue him power and strength in his manhoode to beare the brunt of his indignation nowe looke as this power was effectual in christ iesus the head to make him able and sufficient to beare the panges of hell so the same power of god is in some measure effectuall in all the members of christ to make them both patient and of sufficient strength to beare any affliction as saint paul saith beeing strengthened with all might through his glorious power vnto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnes and this is a notable point which euery one ought to learne that wheras they confesse god to be their almightie father they should here withall labour to feele and haue experience in themselues that he is almightie in the beginning and continuing of grace vnto them and in giuing the power and patience to suffer afflictions further christ iesus when the worke of our redemption was accomplished was lifted vp into heauen and set at the right hande of god in heauenly places farre aboue all principality and powers ampc euen by the power of his father well as this power was made manifest in the head so must it be in the members thereof euery child of god shall hereafter see and feele in himselfe the same power to translate him from this vale of miserie in this life to the kingdome of heauen wherefore to conclude we haue great cause to be thankefull and to praise god for this priuiledge that he sheweth his power in his children in regenerating them in making them die vnto sinne and to stand against the gates of hell amp to suffer afflictions patiently as also that he translates the from death to life and euery one should shew his thankfulnes in labouring to haue experience of this power in himselfe as paul exhorteth vs in his epistles to the colossians amp ephesians yes read all his epistles amp we shal finde he mentioneth no point so often as this namely the mightie power of god manifested first in christ amp secondly in his mebers and he accounteth all things losse that he might know christ amp the vertue of his resurrection this point is the rather to be marked because his power in the matter of grace is not to be seene with eye amp fewe there be in respect that haue felt the vertue thereof in themselues for the deuill doth mightitily shew his cotrary power in the greatest part of the world in carrying them to sinne and wickednes secondly hence we learne that which paul teacheth namely to know that all things worke together for the best vnto them that loue god god is almightie amp therfore able to do whatsoeuer he wil he is also a father amp therfore is willing to doe that which is for our good but some will say we are subiect to many crosses yes to sinne what can our sinnes turne to our good ans if god almightie be thy father he wil turne thine afflictions yes thy sinnes which by nature are euill beyond all exspectation vnto thy saluation and this god will doe to all such as be obedient vnto him yet no man must hereupon presume to sinne thirdly whereas we beleeue that god is a mightie father it serues to confirme god children in the promises of mercie reuealed in his word the chiefest whereof is that if man will turne from their sinnes and beleeue in christ they shall not perish but haue life euerlasting i know some man wil make it an easie thing to beleeue especially those which neuer knewe what faith meant but such persons neede no meanes of confirmation of faith therfore let all those which haue tasted of the hardnes of attaining vnto it learne how to stablish their wauering hearts in the promises of god by the consideration of these two points god is a father and therefore he is willing he is also almightie and therefore he is able to performe his promises he that will be truly resolued of god promises must haue both these setled in his heart and build on them as on two foundations it followeth creatour of heauen and earth we haue spoken of the title of the first person amp of his attributs now we come to speake of his effect namely the creation but before we come to it we are to answer a certaine obiection which may be made at the first it may seeme strage to some that the worke of creation is ascribed to the first person in trinitie the father whereas in the scripture it is common to them all three equally and first that the father is creatour it was neuer doubted as for the second person the son that he is creatour it is euident all things are made by it that is by the son who is the substantiall word of the father amp without it was made nothing that was made and againe it is said that god by his son made the worlde as for the holy ghost the worke of creation is also ascribed vnto him and therefore moses saith the spirit mooued vpon the water and iob saith his spirit hath garnished the heauens how the is this peculiar to the father being comon to al the three persons in trinitie i answer the actions of god are two fold either inward or outward the inward actions are those which one person doth exercise towards another as the father doth beget the son amp this is an inward action peculiar to the father for all inward actions are proper to the persons from whome they are so the son doth receiue the godhead fro the father amp the holy ghost fro the both amp these are inward actions peculiar to these persons so likewise for the father to send his son it is an inward action proper to the father amp cannot be comunicated to the holy ghost amp the son to be sent by the father onely is a thing proper to the son amp not comon to the father or to the holy ghost now outward actions are the actions of the persons in the trinitie to the creatures as the worke of creation the work of preseruatio amp of redemption these amp all such actions are comon to all the three persons the father createth the son createth amp the h ghost createth amp so we may say of the works of gouernment amp of redemption amp of all outward actions of the persons to the creatures but some again may say how then can the work of creation being an outward action of god to the creature be peculiar to the first person the father i answer the work of creation is not so proper to the first person the father as that it cannot also be common to the rest for al the three persons ioyntly created all things of nothing onely they are distinguished in the manner of creating for the father is the cause that beginneth the worke the son puts it in execution the holy ghost is the finisher of it and againe the father createth by the column rom son amp by the h ghost the son createth by the holy ghost amp fro the father the h ghost createth not by the father nor by the son but fro the father amp the son and this is the reason why the work of creation is ascribed here vnto the father because he alone createth after a peculiar manner namely by the son and by the holy ghost but the son and the holy ghost create not by the father but from him thus hauing answered the obiection we come to speake of the creation it selfe in handling whereof we must withal treat of the counsell of god as being the cause thereof amp of the gouernment of the creatures as beeing a worke of god whereby he continues the creation and the order which i wil obserue is first to speake of the counsell of god and secondly of the exequution of his counsell which hath two speciall branches the first the creation the second the preseruation or gouernment of things created the counsell of god is his eternal amp vnchangeable decree wherby he hath ordained al things either past present or to come for his own glorie first i cal it a decree because god hath in it set down with himselfe amp appointed as soueraigne lord what shall be what shal not be i adde further that al things whatsoeuer come vnder the copasse of this decree as paul saith he worketh al things according to the cousel of his wil and our sauiour christ saith that a sparrow canot fall on the ground without the heauenly father yes further he tels his disciples that the very haires of their heads are numbred meaning that they are knowne and set downe in the counsell of god and considering that god is king of heauen and earth and that most wise yes wisdome it selfe and most mightie yes might and power it selfe it must needs b that he hath determined how all things shall come to passe in his kingdome with all their circumstances time place causes ampc in such particular maner that the very least thing that may be is not left vnappointed and vndisposed the counsell of god hath two properties eternitie and vnchangeablenes it is eternall because it was set downe by god from euerlasting before all times as paul saith god hath chosen the ephesians to saluation before all worlds and he saith of himselfe that he was called according to the purpose of god which was before all worlds againe the same counsell once set downe is vnchangeable god saith i am iehovah and i change not with god saith s iames there is no variablenes nor shadow of change nowe such as god is such is his decree and counsell and he beeing vnchangeable his counsels also are vnchangeable god counsell hath two parts his foreknowledge and his will or pleasure his foreknowledge whereby he did foresee all things which were to come his will whereby in a generall manner he wills and ordaines whatsoeuer is to come to passe and therefore such things as god altogether nilleth can not come to passe nowe these two parts of the counsell of god must be ioyned together and not seuered will without knowledge is impotent and foreknowledge without will is idle and therefore such as holde that god doth barely foresee sundrie things to come no manner of way either willing or decreeing the issue and euent of them doe bring in little better then atheisme for if we say that any thing comes to passe either against god will or god not knowing of it or not regarding it we shall make him either impotent or careles amp rase the very foudation of god prouidence and this decree of god must be conceiued of vs as the most generall cause of all things subsisting beeing first in order hauing all other causes vnder it and most principall ouerruling all ouerruled by none thus we see what is to be held touching god counsell now for the better clearing of the truth three obiections of some difficultie are to be answered first may some man say if god decree and ordaine all things whatsoeuer then he decreeth and ordaineth sinne but god decrees not sinne in as much as it is against his will and therefore he decrees not all things answer vve vse not to say that god doth simplie will or decree sinne but onely in part adding with all these caueats i that god willeth and decreeth sinne not properly as it is sinne but as it hath in it sundrie regards amp respects of goodnes so farforth as it is a punishment or chastismet or trial or action or quatenus habet rationem entis no quatenus habet rationem defectus hath any existece in nature ii god can so vse euill instruments that the work done by them beeing a sinne shall neuerthelesse in him be a good worke because he knows how to vse euill instruments well if it be further alledged that god willeth no wickednes psalm we must know that god will is twofold generall amp speciall generall whereby god willeth amp decreeth that a thing shal be amp by this kind of will he may be said to wil sinne amp that without sinne for though he decree it thus yet he doth not instill wickednes into the heart of any sinner amp his decree is onely for a most excellent end for in regard of god which decreeth it bonum amp vt sit malum aug euchr ad laur cap is good that there should be euill to this purpose augustine saith excellently by an vnspeakeable manner it comes to passe that that which is against god will is not without his will voluntate permissiva vult approba va non vult now the special wil of god is that whereby he willeth any thing in such maner that he approoueth it amp deliteth in it and thus indeede we can not say without blasphemie that god willeth sinne thus then we see in what manner and how farforth god may be said to decree sinne againe it may be obiected thus if all things be determined by the vnchangeable decree of god then all things come to passe by an vnchangeable necessitie and man in their actions haue no freewill at all or libertie in doing any thing ans this must be learned as a certen rule that the necessarie decree of god doth not abolish the nature of the second causes and impose necessitie vpon the will of ma but only order amp incline it without any constraint to one part as for example when a people is gathered togeather to heare god worde there is none of them but they know that they come thither by god prouidence and in that respect necessarily yet before they come they had all freedome and libertie in themselues to come or not to come amp god eternall counsell did not hinder the libertie of our wills in comming or not comming nor take away the same but onely incline and turne them to the choice of one part an other example hereof we may haue in our sauiour christ whose state and constitution of bodie if we regard he might haue liued longer yet by the eternall counsel of god he must die at that place at that time at that houre where and when he died whereby we may see that god counsel doth not hinder the wil of ma but only order amp dispose it which answer being wel marked we shall see these two will stande together the necessarie and vnchangeable counsell of god and the free will of man and againe that the same action may be both necessarie and contingent necessarie in regard of the highest cause the cousell of god not necessarie but contingent in respect of the second causes as among the rest the will of man thirdly some will yet obiect against this doctrine that if all things come to passe according to god vnchageable decree then what needs the vsing of any meanes what needs the preaching of the word amp receiuing of the sacraments what needes any lawes princes magistrates or gouernment what needs walking in mens ordinarie callings all is to no ende for let man play or worke sleepe or wake let him doe what he will all is one for god eternall counsell must needs come to passe therefore it may seeme in vaine for man to busie themselues about such things ans but we must know that as god hath appointed all things to come to passe in his eternall and vnchangeable counsell so in the same decree he hath together set downe the means amp waies whereby he will haue the same things brought to passe for these two must neuer be seuered the thing to be done amp the means whereby it is done vve may read in the acts in pauls daungerous voyage towards rome an angel of the lord told paul that god had giuen him all that sayled with him in the ship nowe the souldiers and marriners hearing this might reason thus with theselues seeing god hath decreed to saue vs all we may doe what we will there is no danger for we shall all come to land aliue but marke what paul saith except these abide in the ship ye cannot be safe where we may see as it was the eternall counsell of god to saue paul amp all that were with him so he decreed to saue all by this particular meanes of their aboad in the ship king ezechias was restored to his health amp receiued from god a promise that he should haue yeares added to his daies amp the promise was confirmed by signe nowe what doth he cast off all means no but as he was prescribed so he applieth a bunch of drie figges to his sore and vseth still his ordinarie dyet therefore it is grosse ignorance amp madnes in man to reason so against god decree god in his vnchangeable counsell hath decreed amp set down all things how they shal be therefore i will vse no means but liue as i list nay rather we must say the contrarie because god hath decreed this thing or that to be done therfore i wil vse the means which god hath appointed to bring the same to passe now followes the creation which is nothing else but a worke of the blessed trinitie forming amp framing his creatures which were not before amp that of nothing the points to be knowne concerning the creation are many the first is the thing by which god did begin amp finish the creatio and we must vnderstande that at the first god made all things without any instrument or meanes amp not as man do which bring to passe their busines by servant amp helps but only by his word amp commandement as the psalmist saith he commanded and all things were made in the beginning god said let their be light amp there was light amp by the same meanes was the creatio of euery creature following the very power of the word and comandement of god was such as by it that thing was made amp had a being which before was not it may be demanded what word this was by which god is said to make all things ans the word of god in scripture is taken waies for the substantiall word for the souding or written word for the operatiue or powerful word the substatial word is the secod person begotte of the substace of the father nowe howsoeuer it be true that god the father did create al things by his word that is by his sone yet doth it not seeme to be true that by these words god said let there be this or that that the sone is m nt for that word vvhich god gaue out in the creation vvas in time vvheras the sone is the vvord of the father before all times and againe it is a vvord common to the three persons equally vvhereas the so is the vvord of the father onely furthermore it is not like that it was any souding word stading of letters amp syllables amp vttered to the creatures after the vsuall maner of me that was the cause of the it remains therfore that all things were made by the operatiue vvord vvhich is nothing but the pleasure vvil amp appointmet of god amp is more povverful to bring a thing to passe then all the meanes in the vvorld beside for god vvilling of any thing is his effecting amp doing of it and this is prooued by dauid vvhen he saith he spake the word and they were made he comanded and they were created hence vve must take out a speciall lesson needefull to be learned of euery man looke vvhat povver god vsed amp shevved in making the creatures vvhen they vvere not the same povver he both can amp vvil shevv forth in recreating amp redeeming sinful me by the pretious blood of christ by his vvord he created mans heart when it vvas not amp he can amp vvill as easily create in any of such a nevv heart specially vvhe vve vse the good means appointed for that end as vvhen christ said to dead lazarus lazarus come forth he arose amp came forth of his graue though boud had amp foot so vvhe the lord speaks to our dead hearts by his vvord amp spirit vve shal rise forth of the graues of our sinnes amp corruptions in the creatio of the great vvorld god said let there be light amp presently darknes gaue place amp the same he ca do to the little vvorld that is to man we are by nature darknes amp let god but speake to our blind vnderstadings our ignorace shal depart amp vve shal be inlightned vvith the knovvledge of the true god and of his vvil as paul saith god that comaunded the light to shine out of darknes is he which hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knovvledge of the glory of god in the face of iesus christ secondly god made all creatures without motion labour or defatigation for his very bidding of the worke to be done was the doing of it and this thing no creature can doe but god onely though vnto adam labour was without paine before the fall thirdly the matter amp the first beginning of all creatures was nothing that is all things were made when as there was nothing whereof they might be made as paul saith god calleth those things vvhich be not as though they were and indeed in the first creation al things must be made either of the essence of god or of nothing but a creature can not be made of the essence of god for it hath no parts it is not divisible and god made all things that were made out of himselfe or his owne essence the conclusion then is that the framing of the creatures in the beginning was not of any matter but of nothing this must teach us to humble our selves many there be that stande upon their ancestours but let them here looke whence they came first namely as abraham saith of himselfe of dust and ashes and what was this dust and ashes made of surely of nothing wherefore every mans first beginning is of nothing well then such man as are caried away with their pedigree and descent if they looke well into it they shall finde small cause to boast or bragge and this cosideration of our first beginning must moue vs to true humiliatio in our selves fourthly god in framing his creatures in the beginning made them good yes very good now the goodnesse of the creature is nothing else but the perfect estate of the creature whereby it was conformable to the will and minde of the creator allowing and approouing of it when he had made it for a creature is not first good and then approoved of god but because it is approoved of god therefore it is good but wherein will some say standes this goodnesse of the creature i answer in three things i in the comelinesse beautie and glorie of euery worke in his kinde both in forme and constitution of the matter ii in the excellencie of the vertue which god hath giuen to it for as he hath appointed euery creature for some especiall end so he hath fitted and furnished it with sufficient power and vertue for the accomplishing of the same end iii in the exceeding benefite and profitablenesse that came by them to man but since the fall of man this goodnesse of the creature is partly corrupted and partly diminished therefore when wee see any want defect or deformitie in any of them we must haue recourse backe againe to the apostasie of our first parents and remember our fall in them and say with a sorowfull heart this comes to passe by reason of mans most wretched sinne which hath defiled heauen and earth and drawen a curse not onely upon himselfe but upon the rest of the creatures for his sake whereby their goodnesse is much defaced fiftly the end of creation is the glory of god as salomon saith god made all things for his owne sake yes even the wicked for the day of evill and god propounds this principall end to himselfe not as though he wanted glorie and would purchase it unto himselfe by the creation for hee is most glorious in himselfe and his honour and praise being infinite can neither be increased nor decreased but rather that he might communicate and make manifest his glorie to his creatures and giue them occasion to magnifie the same for the reasonable creatures of god beholding his glory in the creation are mooved to testifie and declare the same among man the sixt shall be touching the time of the beginning of the world which is betweene fiue thousand and sixe thousand yeres agoe for moses set downe exactly the computation of time from the making of the worlde to his owne daies and the prophets after him haue with like diligence set downe the continuance of the same to the verie birth of christ but for the exact account of yeeres chronologers are not all of one minde some say there be from the creation to christes birth as beroaldus some as hierome and bede some as luther and io lucidus some as melancthon in his chronicle amp functius some as bullinger and tremellius some towards as buntingus now from the birth of christ to this day are yeeres and adding these together the whole time amounteth and god would haue the verie time of the beginning of the world to be revealed that it might be knowen to the church when the couenant of grace was first giuen by god to man and when it was afterward renewed and how christ came in the fulnesse of time gal that we might know that the world was not made for the eternall and euerliuing god but for man that we might learne not to set our hearts on the world and on the things therein which haue beginning and end but seeke for things eternall in heauen and before the time which i haue named began there was nothing beside god the world it selfe and all things else were vncreated some man use to obiect and say what did god doe all that while before the world was how did he imploy himselfe what was he idle ansvver the iewes to this bad question make as badde an answere for they say he was continually occupied in making many litle worlds which he continually destroyed as he made them because none pleased him till hee made this but we must rather say that some things are reuealed which god did then as that he decreed what should come to passe when the world was amp that the the blessed persons in trinitie did take eternall delight ech in other if any man will needs know more let him heare what moses saith secret things belong to the lord our god but things revealed to vs and to our children for ever and let him marke what one eluding the question answered namely that god was making hell fire to burne all such curious persons as will needs know more of god then hee hath revealed to them for where god hath not a mouth to speake there we must not haue an eare to heare therefore wee must let such curious questions passe seventhly some may aske in what space did god make the vvorld i ansvver god coulde haue made the world and all things in it in one moment but he began and finished the whole worke in sixe distinct daies in the first day he made the matter of all things and the light in the second the heauens in the third day he brought the sea into his compasse and made the drie land appeare and caused it to bring forth hearbs plants and trees in the fourth hee made the sun the moone amp the starres in the heauen in the fifth day hee made the fish of the sea the foules of the heauen and euery creeping thing in the sixth day hee made the beastes of the field and all cattell and in the end of the sixt day he made man thus in sixe distinct spaces of time the lorde did make all things and that especially for three causes i to teach man that they ought to haue a distinct and serious consideration of every creature for if god had made the world in a moment some might haue said this work is so mistical that no man can speak of it but for the preventing of this cavill it was his pleasure to make the world and all things therein in sixe dayes and the seventh day he commaunded it to be sanctified by man that they might distinctly and seriously meditate upon euerie worke of the creation ii god made the world and euery thing therein in sixe distinct daies to teach vs what wonderfull power and libertie he had ouer all his creatures for hee made the light when there was neither sun nor moone nor starres to shevve that in giuing light to the world he is not bound to the sun to any creature or to any meanes for the light was made the first day but the son the moone and the starres were not created before the fourth day againe trees and plantes were created the third day but yet the sun moone and the starres and raine which nourish and make hearbs trees and plantes to growe were not created till after the third day vvhich shevves plainely that god can make trees plants amp herbs to grow without the meanes of raine and vvithout the vertue and operation of the sun the moone amp the starres iii he made the worlde in sixe distinct dayes and framed all things in this order to teach us his wonderfull providence of his creatures for before man was created he prouided for him a dwelling place and all things necessarie for his perpetuall preseruation and perfect happinesse and felicitie so also he created beast and cattell but not before he had made hearbs plants and grasse and all meanes whereby they are preserued and if god had this care ouer man when as yet hee was not much more will god haue care ouer him now when hee is and hath a being in nature and thus much concerning the pointes of doctrine touching the creation the duties follow and first by the worke of creation we may discerne the true iehouah from all false god amp idols in the world this esaiah maketh plain bringing in the lorde reasoning thus i am god and there is no other god besides me how is that prooued thus i forme the light and create darkenesse i make peace and create evill i the lord doe all these things if a man aske thee how thou knowest the true god from all false god thou must answere by the worke of eation for he alone is the maker of heauen and earth and all things in them this propertie can not agree to any creature to any man saint or angell nay not to all man and all angels they can not giue being to a creature which before was nothing secondly wheras god the father is the creatour of allthings and hath giuen unto man reason understanding and abilitie more then to other creatures we are taught to consider and meditate of the worke of god creation this the wise man teacheth vs saying consider the worke of god and indeed it is a speciall dutie of euery man which professeth himselfe to be a member of god church as he acknowledgeth god to be the creatour so to looke upon his workemanshippe and view and consider all creatures a skilfull workeman can haue no greater a disgrace then when hee hath done some famous thing to haue his friende passe by his worke and not so much as looke upon it if it be demaunded for what ende must we looke upon the worke of god creation i ansvvere that in it vvee may see and discerne god power wisedome loue mercie and providence and all his attributes and in all things his glorie this is a most necessarie dutie to be learned of euery man we thinke nothing too much or to good to bestow on vaine shewes amp plaies idle sportes and pastimes which are the vanities of man and we doe most willingly beholde them in the meane season utterly neglecting and contemning the glorious worke of god creation well the lorde god hath appointed his sabaoth to be sanctified not only by the publique ministerie of the worde and by private prayer but also by an especiall consideration and meditation of god creatures and therefore the duetie of euery man is this distinctly and seriously to view and consider the creatures of god and thereby take occasion to glorifie his name by ascribing vnto him the vvisedome glorie povver and omnipotencie that is due unto him for the same thirdly wee must giue god the glorie in all his creatures because hee is the creatour of them all so in the revelation the foure and tvventie elders fall downe before him and say thou article vvorthy o lorde to receive glorie and honour and povver giuing this reason for thou hast created all things and for thy vvills sake they are and haue beene created reade the psalmes and both vvhich tende to this that god may be praised because he is the creatour of all things and therefore must haue all the glorie vvee knowe that when man beholde any curious vvorke of a cunning and skillfull craftesman straightway they vvill leaue the vvorke and inquire after him that made it that they may praise his skill the same is our dutie in this case when we come abroad and beholde every where in all the creatures the admirable and unspeakeable vvisedome goodnesse and povver of god then vvee must make hast from the creature and goe forvvarde to the creatour to praise and glorifie him and herein must vvee shevve our selues to differ from bruite beast in that in the vse and view of god creatures we doe returne due glory praise and honour unto the creatour our fourth duty is set downe by the prophet amos who moouing the people to meete god by repentance addeth a reason taken fro the creation he that fourmeth the mountaines amp createth the winds which declareth unto man what is his thought which maketh the morning darkenesse ampc the lord god of hosts is his name the meaning of the prophet is this god is a terrible iudge amp we are as traitors amp rebels against him therfore the best way that we can take is this he is coming to iudgement let us therfore meete him amp fall downe before him amp humble our selues under his mighty had and the holy ghost by the prophet would mooue the people to meete god by serious repetance by a reason framed thus if god who is their iudge be able to create the winds and to forme the moutaines amp to make the morning darknes then he is also able to make an eternall iudgement for their confusion and therfore all such as be impenitent sinners let the prepare themselues to turne unto him amp surely if man had grace to lay this to their hearts they would not liue so log in their sinnes without repentance as they do nay rather they would prepare themselues to meet him in the way before he come to iudgement because he is a creator amp therefore able to bring infinite punishments upon them at his pleasure and to bring them to nothing as he made them of nothing and let them know it whosoeuer they be that go forwarde in their sinnes that god the creator whensoeuer hee will can ope hell to deuoure them amp that he can shew him selfe as mightie in his iudgement to mens destruction as he vvas in the beginning in giuing us a being vvhen vve vvere nothing wherefore notable is the practise of david vvho ineures himself to the feare of god by the consideration of his creation saying i am fearefully and wonderfully made ampc lastly those vvhich haue bin impenitent sinners all their life past must not only learne to repent for their sinnes but also endeauour to perfourme obedience unto god vvord god is a creatour and the thing created shoulde in all respectes be conformable to his vvill for david saith thine hands have fashioned me amp framed me give me vnderstanding therfore that i may learne thy comandemets and good reaso for there is no man of any trade but hee vvould faine haue all that he maketh and deuiseth to be used but yet so as the use thereof must be conformable to the vvill of the maker for this cause moses that faithfull servant of god saieth that the people of israel dealt wrongfully vvith the lord why for he hath created them and proportioned them he is their father and he bought them yet they haue dishonoured him by corrupting themselues towardes him by their vice all creatures in heauen and in earth doe the will of the creatour except man and the deuill and his angels for the sun the moone and the starres they keepe that course which god hath appointed them but man though he be bound to doe the will of god because god is his creator yet he rebells against him the potter if in tempering his clay he can not make and frame it according to his minde at length hee will dash it in peeces so god hee createth man not that he should doe his owne vvill but god vvill and therefore that man vvhosoeuer he be that follovveth the lustes of his ovvne vvicked heart and vvill not be brought to be conformable to god vvill but continues rebellious still the lorde in his vvrath vvill confound him eternally therefore it standes euery man in hand to yeeld himselfe plyable unto god vvill amp to indeauour to obey it by keeping a good conscience before god and all man and by vvalking faithfully in his calling othervvise the ende vvill be confusion if a man haue a trade and other man come into his shoppe and use such instruments as be there to a wrong end though they vvere their owne yet it vvould grieue him to see it so god created all things for his ovvne use and for the accomplishing of his vvill but rebellious man conformes himselfe to the devil vvill and thereby no doubt he grieuously offendeth god and thus much of the duties novv in the third place follow the consolations unto god church and people first as s paul saith god is a creator yes a faithfull creator the properties of a faithfull creatour are two i he will preserue his creature no man is so tender ouer any worke as hee that made it for he can not abide to see it any way abused now god being a faithfull creatour tenderly loues all his creature so iob reasoneth with god that hee will not cast him off because he is the worke of his hands ii god will beare with his creature to see whether it will be brought to any good ende and use before he will destroy it and to use the former comparison the potter will turne and worke the clay euery way to make a vessell unto his minde but if it will frame no way then he will cast it away and dash it against the wall and so god who created man and still preserueth him and useth all meanes to make him conformable to his will before hee cast him away the lorde did long strive vvith man in the olde worlde to turne them from their wickednesse but when nothing would serue them it is saide it repented the lorde that hee had made man on the earth amongst us euery one is the creature of god now if wee shall rebell against this our creator it may be he will beare with us for a time but if we continue therein and do not turne to him by repentace he will bring upon us a finall destruction both in body and soule yet i say before he doe this he will trie all meanes to preserue us and turne us unto him and afterwarde if nothing will serue then he will shew forth his power in mens confusion amp therefore it stands us in hand to looke unto it secondly looke what power the lord did manifest in the creation of all things the same power he both can and will make manifest in the redemption of mankind in the beginning god made all things by his worde and so likewise he is able still to make by the power of his word of a wicked man that is dead in sinne a true and liuely member of christ which the prophet isay signifieth when he saith the lord that created the heavens and spred them abroad hee that stretcheth forth the earth and the body thereof ampc i the lord haue called thee in righteousnesse this must not encourage evill man in their wickednesse but it serueth to comfort the people of god considering that the same god which once created them is also as able to saue them and will shewe himselfe as mightie in their redemption as hee did in creating them of nothing and thus much of the creation in generall now it follovveth that vve come to the handling of the partes thereof for it is not said barely that god is a creatour but particularly that he is a creatour of heauen amp earth of both which we will speake in order and first of the creation of heauen heaven in god vvorde it signifieth all that is aboue the earth for the aire wherein we breath is called heauen and according to this acception of the worde there are three heauens as paul saith he was taken up into the third heauen the first of these heauens is that space which is from the earth upvvard unto the firmament where the starres are thus we reade often in the psalmes the birdes which flie in the aire betvveene the earth and the starres are called the foules of the heaven and when god sent the floode to drovvne the olde vvorld moses saith the windowes of heauen vvere opened meaning that god powred downe raine from the cloudes abundantly for the making of a floode to drowne the worlde the second heauen is that which conteineth the sun the moone and the starres so moses saith that god in the beginning created the sun the moone and the starres and placed them in the firmament of heauen besides these two heauens there is a thirde which is inuisible and yet it is the worke of god handes and it is that glorious place where christ in his manhoode sitteth at the right hande of the father and whether the soules of the faithfull departed are carried and placed and in which at the end of the world shall all the elect both in bodie and soule haue perfect ioy and blisse in the glorious sight and presence of god for euer but for the better conceiuing the trueth wee are to scanne and consider three questions first whether this third heauen be a creature for many haue thought it was neuer created but was eternall with god himselfe but it is a grosse errour contrarie to god vvorde for the scripture saith abraham looked for a citie meaning the heauenly ierusalem this thirde heauen having a foundation vvhose builder and maker is god further if it be eternall it must either be a creatour or a creature but it is no creatour for then it shoulde be god and therefore it must needes be a creature but some will say the lorde is eternall and this thirde heauen hath alwaies beene the place of the lord abode and therefore it is also eternall ansvver true it is that god doeth shewe his glorie and maiestie in the thirde heauen but yet that cannot obtaine his godhead as salomon saith beholde the heavens and the heavens of heavens are not able to containe thee wherefore though god doeth manifest his eternall glorie in this thirde heauen yet it doeth not follow that therefore it shoulde be eternall for he needes no place to dvvell in for hee is every where filling all things with his presence excluded from no place the seconde question where this thirde heauen is ansvvere there are some protestant say it is euery where and they hold this opinion to maintaine the reall presence of the lordes body in or about the sacrament but if it vvere euery where then hell shoulde be in heauen which no man will say but heauen indeed is aboue these visible heauens which we see with our eyes so the apostle saith christ ascended on high farre above all heauens ampc and againe it is saide of steven that beeing full of the holy ghost he looked up steadfastly into the heauens and sawe them open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god thirdly it may be demanded why god created this thirde heauen ansvver god made it for this cause that there might be a certaine place wherein he might make manifest his glorie and maiestie to his elect angels and man for the which cause it was created a thousand folde more glorious then the two former heavens are in which respect it is called paradise by reason of the ioy and pleasure arising from god glorious presence and our sauiour christ calleth it the house of god his father because into it must be gathered all god children it is called the kingdome of heaven because god is the king thereof and ruleth there in perfect glorie true it is god hath his kingdome here on earth but he ruleth not so fully and gloriously here as hee shall in heauen for this is the kingdome of grace but that is the kingdome of his glorie where he so reigneth that he will be all in all first in christ and then in the elect both angels and man now followes the duties wherunto we are moved principally in consideration of the making of the third heauen first if god created it especially for the manifestation of his glorie unto man that at the ende of this world by the fruition of god most glorious presence there they might haue perfect ioye and felicitie wee haue occasion here to consider the wonderfull madnesse of the vvorlde that reigneth euery where among man which onely haue regarde to the state of this life and cast all their care on this world and neuer so much as dreame of the ioyfull and blessed estate which is prepared for god children in the highest heauen if a man hauing two houses one but a homely cottage and the other a princely pallace should leaue the better and take all the care and paines for the dressing up of the first would not euerie man say he were a mad man yes undoubtedly and yet this is the spirituall madnesse that reigneth euery where among man for god hath prepared for us two houses one is this our bodie which we beare about us which is an house of clay as iob saith vvee dvvell in houses of clay whose foundation is dust which shall be destroyed before the moth and as peter saith a tabernacle or tent which wee must shortly take downe and wherein we abide but as pilgrimes and strangers againe the same god of his wonderfull goodnesse hath provided for us a second house in the third heauen wherein we must not abide for a time and so depart but for euermore enioy the blessed felicitie of his glorious presence for all this marke a spirituall phrensie possessing the mindes of man for they imploy all their care and industrie for the maintaining of this house of claye whose foundation is but dust but for the blessed estate of the second house which is prepared for them in the kingdome of heauen they haue no regarde or care they vvill both runne and ride from place to place day and night both by sea and lande but for vvhat is it for the preparing of a mansion place in the heauenly ierusalem nothing lesse for they will scarse goe forth of the doore to use any meanes whereby they may come unto it but all their studie is to patch vp the ruines and breaches of their earthly cabbine now let all man iudge in their owne consciences whether as i haue saide this be not more then senselesse madnesse againe the body is but a tabernacle wherein we must rest as it were for a night as a stranger doeth in an inne and so away but the second house is eternall in the heavens an everlasting seate of all felicitie and therefore our dutie is aboue all things to seeke the kingdome of heauen and the righteousnesse thereof as christ himselfe biddeth us and if the lorde haue there prepared such a place for vs then wee must in this worlde use all good meanes whereby we may be made worthy the fruition of it amp also fitte and ready at the day of death to enter into it which at the day of iudgement we shall fully possesse both in soule and body and there reigne eternally in all happinesse with god almightie our creatour the father the son and the holy ghost but some may say how shall a man so prepare himselfe that he may be fitte for that place ansvver this the holy ghost teacheth us for speaking of this heauenly ierusalem hee saith there shall enter into it none uncleane thing neither whatsoever vvorketh abomination or lyes the meanes then to make our selues fitte is to seeke to be reconciled to god in christ for our sinnes past and withall to indeauour to haue an assurance of the free remission and pardon of them all in the blood of christ and as touching that part of life which is to come wee must remember what s john saith euery one that hath this hope purifieth himselfe meaning that he which hath hope to reigne with christ in heauen vseth the meanes whereby he may purifie and keepe himselfe from sinne as also he saith after that he which is borne of god keepeth himselfe and the wicked one toucheth him not signifying that all such persons as are truly iustified and sanctified carrie such a narrowe and straite watch ouer the whole course of their liues and conuersations that the deuill can neuer giue them deadlie wounds and wholly ouercome them now the man that is resolued in his conscience of the pardon of his sinne for the time past and hath a steadfast purpose in his heart to keepe himselfe upright and continually to walke in righteousnesse and true holinesse all the daies of his life this man i say is prepared and made fitte to enter into the heauenly ierusalem come death vvhen it wil he is readie and howsoeuer hee must not looke for heauen here upon earth yet hee is as it were in the suburbes of this heauenly citie and at the ende of this life the king thereof the lorde iesus will open the gates and receiue him into his kingdome for hee is alreadie entred into the kingdome of grace beeing prepared also one day when god will to enter into the kingdome of glorie to conclude this point let euery man in the feare of god be mooued hereby to set his heart to prepare him selfe that vvhen god shall call him hence hee may be fitte to enter into that glorie secondly seeing god hath prepared the thirde heauen for us it teacheth euery man in this worlde to be content with the estate vvherein god hath placed him whether it be high or low rich or poore why so because here he is but a pilgrime and liues in a cottage of clay and in a tent wherein he must abide but a while as a pilgrime doth oftentimes carrying his house about with him and wee shall in better sort accept the afflictions which god sends us in this life if we remember that there is prepared for us a place of ioy which must be our resting place and perfect felicitie for euermore this was the practise of the children of god especially of abraham for when the lorde called him out of his owne countrey hee obeyed and by faith abode in the promised lande as in a straunge countrey as one that dvvelt in tentes vvith isaac and iaakob heires vvith him in the same promise and the reason followeth for hee looked for a citie having a foundation vvhose builder and maker is god they beleeued that these things vvhich the lorde promised were shadovves of better things and hereon stayed them selues beeing well content with that estate wherto god had called them so paul was contented to beare the afflictions vvhich god had laide upon him and his reason was because saieth hee vvee looke not on thinges vvhich are seene but on things vvhich are not seene for the things vvhich are seene are temporall but the thinges vvhich are not seene are eternall and in the next chapter vvee knovve saith hee that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed vvee have a dvvelling given vs of god that is an house not made vvith handes but eternall in the heavens and for this cause his desire vvas rather to remoove out of this bodie and to be with the lord and thus much concerning heauen now followeth the seconde part of god creation in these vvordes and earth earth signifieth the huge masse or bodie standing of sea and lande on vvhich wee liue and all things that be in or upon the earth whatsoeuer as paul saith for by him vvere created all things that are in heaven or in earth ampc in other creedes which were made since this of the apostles being expositions of that there is added maker of all things visible and invisible here wee haue occasion to speake of all creatures but that were infinite therefore i will make choise of these two good angels and man i that angels had a beginning it is no question for paul saith that by god all things were created in heauen and earth things visible and invisible whether thrones principality or powers and in respect of the creation angels are called the sonnes of god but the time amp day of their creation can not be set downe further then this that they were created in the compasse of the sixe daies for moses saith thus namely in the compasse of the first sixe daies the heauens and the earth were fashioned and all the hoast of them that is all varietie of creatures in heauen and earth serving for the beautie and glorie thereof whereof no doubt the angels are the principall ii touching the nature of angels some haue thought that they are nothing but qualities amp motions in the minds of man as the sadduces and the libertines of this time but the truth is that they are spirits that is spirituall and invisible substances created by god and really subsisting for the scripture ascribes unto them such kind of actions which can not be perfourmed by the creatures saue only such as be substances as to stand before the throne of god to behold the face of the father to carry mens soules to heauen ampc yet must we not imagine that they are bodily substaces consisting of flesh and bone and though they tooke upon them visible shapes amp formes amp did eate and drinke in the company of man amp thereupon are called man in scripture yet they did this by diuine dispensation for a time that they might the better performe the actions amp businesses among man to which they were by god appointed and the body of man which they assumed were no partes of their natures united to them as our body are to us but rather they were as garmets are to us which they might put off amp on at their pleasure if any shall aske whence they had these body the answer is that either they were created of nothing by the power of god or framed of some other matter subsisting before if againe it be asked what became of these body when they laide them downe because they used them but for a time the answere may be that if they were made of nothing they were againe resolued into nothing if made of other creatures that then they were resolued into the same body of which they were first made though indeed we can define nothing certenly in this point iii angels are reasonable creatures of excellent knowledge and understanding farre surpassing all man saue christ their knowledge is threefold naturall revealed experimentall naturall which they receiued from god in the creation revealed which god makes manifest to them in processe of time wheras before they knew it not thus god revealed to gabriel the mysterie of the seuentie weekes daniel amp and in the apocalyps many things are revealed to the angels that they might reveale them to us experimentall knowledge is that which they get by obseruing the dealings of god in the whole world but specially in the church and thus paul saith that to principality and powers in heauenly places is the manifold wisdom of god by the church iv and as the knowledge so also the power of the good angels is exceeding great they are able to doe more then all man can therefore paul calls them mightie angels thess yes their power is farre superiour to the power of the wicked angels who since the fall are vnder them and cannot preuaile against them v the place of the aboad of angels is the higest heauen vnlesse they be sent thence by the lord to doe some thing appointed by him this our sauiour christ teacheth when he saith that the angels of little ones doe alreadie behold the face of the father in heauen and the wicked angels before their fall were placed in heauen for they were cast thence vi that there be certaine distinctions and diuersities of angels it is very likely because they are called thrones and principality and powers cherubim and seraphim but what be the distinct degrees and orders of angels and whether they are to be distinguished by their natures gifts or offices no man by scripture can determine vii the ministerie of angels to which the lord hath set them apart is three fold and it respecteth either god himselfe or his church or his enemy the ministery which they performe to god is first of all to adore praise and glorifie him continually thus the cherubims in esaies vision cry one to another holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts the world is full of his glorie and when they were to publish the birth of the messias they begin on this manner glorie to god in the highest heauens peace on earth and john in his vision heard the angels about the throne crying with a loud voyce worthie is the lambe ampc to receiue power riches and strength wisedome and honour and glorie and praise and indeed the heighest ende of the ministerie of angels is the glorie of god the second is to stand in god presence euermore readie to do his commandements as dauid saith praise the lord yee his angels that excell in strength that doe his commandements in obeying the voice of his word and here is a good lesson for vs vve pray daily that we may doe the will of god as the angels in heauen doe it let vs therefore be followers of the holy angels in praising god and in doing his commandements as they doe the ministerie of angels concerning the church standes in this that they are ministring spirits for the good of them which shall be heyres of saluation the good is three fold in this life in the ende of this life and in the last iudgement againe the good which they procure to the people of god in this life is either in respect of bodie or soule in respect of the bodie in that they doe most carefully performe all manner of duties which doe necessarily tend to preserue the temporall life of god children euen from the beginning of their daies to the ende dauid saith that they pitch their tents about them that feare the lord when agar was cast foorth of abrahams familie and wandred in the wildernes an angell comes vnto hir and giues hir counsell to returne to hir mistres and humble hir selfe vvhen elijah fled from iesabel he was both comforted directed and fedde by an angell and an angel bids the same elijah be of good courage and without feare to go to king achazias amp reprooue him angels bring lot and his familie out of sodom and gomorrha before they burne the cities with fire amp brimstone vvhen iacob feared his brother esau he saw angels comming vnto him and he plainly acknowledgeth that they were sent to be his protectours and his guides in his iournie abraham beeing perswaded of the assistance of god angels in all his waies said to his servant the lord god of heauen who tooke me from my fathers house ampc will send his angell before thee the wise man that came to see christ are admonished by angels to returne another way amp ioseph by the directio of an angel fled into egypt that he might preserue christ fro the hads of the cruel tyrat the tets of the israelites was garded by angels the children are deliuered fro the fierie furnace amp daniel out of the lyos den by angels whe christ was in heauines they ministred vnto him amp coforted him amp they brought peter out of priso amp set him at liberty againe the angels procure good vnto the soules of the godly in that they are maintainers and furtherers of the true worship of god and of all good meanes whereby we attaine to saluation the law was deliuered in mount sina by angels and a great part of the reuelation of john they expound to daniel the weekes they instruct the apostles touching the returne of christ to the last iudgement angels forbid john to worship them but to worship god the creatour of heauen and earth they set the apostles out of prison and bid them teach in the temple an angel brings philip to the eunuch that he may expound the scriptures to him lastly they reueale the mysteries and the will of god as to abraham that he should not kil his son isaac to marie and elizabeth the natiuitie of john baptist and of christ our sauiour amp al this they do according vnto the wil of god gal beside all this angels reioyce at the conuersion of sinners by the ministerie of the gospell and for the churches sake they protect not onely particular man but euen whole nation and kingdomes the ministerie of angels in the ende of this life is to carie the soules of the godly into abrahams bosome as they did the soule of lazarus and in the day of iudgement to gather all the elect that they may come before christ and enter into eternall fruition of glorie both in bodie amp soule the third amp last part of the minsterie of angels concerns god enemy amp it is to execute iudgements on all wicked persons and impenitent sinners thus all the first borne of egypt are slain by an angel vvhen iosua was about to sack ierico an angel appeared vnto him as a captaine with a drawn sword to fight for israel when the host of senacherib came against israel the angel of the lord in one night slue an hundred eightie and fiue thousand because herod gaue not glorie vnto god the angel of the lord smote him so as he was eaten vp of lice and died and thus we see what points we are to marke touching the good angels now followeth the vse which we are to make in regard of their creation first whereas they are god ministers to inflict punishments vpon the wicked here is a speciall point to be learned of vs that euery man in the feare of god take heede how he liueth and continueth in his sinnes for the case is dangerous considering that god hath armies of angels which stand readie euery where to execute god heauie iudgements vpon them that liue thus whe the people of israel had sinned against the lord moses saith they were naked that is open to all the iudgements of god euen destitute of the guard of his good angels vvretched balaam that wizard went to balaac to curse the children of israel and as he went it is said the angel of the lord stood in his way with a drawne sword and if the asse had not beene wiser then his master the angel had slaine him vvhereby it appeares that when we rush on into the practise of any sinne we doe as much as in vs lieth to cause god to send downe his iudgements vpon vs for our sinnes and that by the ministerie of his angels secondly we are taught another lesson by christ himselfe see saith he that you despise not one of these little ones now marke his reason for i say vnto you that in heauen their angels doe alwaies behold the face of my father by little ones he meaneth young infants which are within the couenant or others which are like to young infants in simplicitie and innocencie of life and humilitie and christ will not haue them to be despised a duetie very needefull to be stoode vpon in these times for now adaies if a man carrie but a shewe of humilitie of good conscience and of the feare of god he is accouted but a sillie fellow he is hated mocked amp despised on euery hand but this ought not to be so for him whome god honoureth with the protection of his good angels why should any mortall man despise and it stands mockers and scorners in hand to take heede whome they mock for though man for their parts put vp many abuses and iniuries yet their angels may take iust reuenge by smiting them with plagues and punishments for their offences thirdly seeing angels are about vs amp serue for the good of man we must doe whatsoeuer we doe in reuerent and seemely manner as paul giues counsell to the philippians brother saith he whatsoeuer things are true whatsoeuer things are honest iust pure and pertaine to loue of good report if there be any vertue if there be any praise thinke on these things many man doe all their affaires orderly for auoiding shame but we must do the same vpon a further ground namely because god holy angels wait on vs and considering that man haue care to behaue themselues well when they are before man what a shame is it for a man to behaue himselfe vnseemely either in open or in secret he then beeing before the glorious angels paul saith that the woman ought to haue power on her head because of the angels that is not onely the ministers of the church but god heauenly angels which daily wait vpon his children and guard them in all their waies fourthly this must teach vs modestie and humilitie for the angels of god are very notable and excellent creatures and therefore they are called in the psalmes elohim god yet how excellent so euer they be they abase themselues to become guardiens and keepers vnto sinneful man nowe if the angels doe so abase themselues then much more ought euery man to abase and humble himselfe in modestie and humilitie before god and what so euer our calling is we must not be puffed vp but be content this is a necessarie dutie for all but especially for those which are in the schooles of the prophets whatsoeuer their gifts or birth be they must not thinke themselues too good for the calling of the ministerie and if god haue called vs thereunto wee must be content to become servant vnto all in the matter of saluatio though the me be neuer so base or simple for no ma doth so farre excell the basest person in the world as the glorious angels of god doe exceede the most excellent man that is therefore seeing they vouchsafe to become servant vnto vs we must not think our selues to good to serue our poore brother and thus much of the duties nowe follow the consolations that arise from this that god hath giuen his glorious angels to serue for the protection amp safegard of his church and people if mens spirituall eyes were open they should see the deuill and his angels and all the wicked of this world to fight against them and if there were no meanes of comfort in this case then our estate were most miserable but marke as god servant hath all these wicked ones to be his enemy so he hath garrisons of angels that pitch their tents about him and defend him from them all so dauid saith he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee and they shall keepe thee in all thy waies that thou dash not thy foote against a stone where the angels of god are compared to nurces which carie litle children in their armes feede them and are alwaies readie at hand to saue them from falls and many other dangers when the king of syria sent his horse amp chariots to take elisha the lord prophet because he reuealed his counsell to the king of israel his servant saw them round about dothan where he was and he cried alas master what shall we doe then elisha answeared feare not for they that be with vs are more then they that be with them and he besought the lord to open his servant eyes that he might see amp the lord opened his eyes amp he looked amp behold the mountains were full of horse and charriots of fire round about elisha so likewise not many yeares agoe our land was preserued from the invasion of the spainyards whose huge navie lay vpon our sea coasts but how were we deliuered from them surely by no strength nor power nor cunning of man but it was the lord no doubt by his angels that did keepe our coasts and did scatter our enemy and drowne them let enemy rage and let them doe what they will if a man keepe himselfe in the waies which god prescribeth he hath god angels to guide and preserue him which thing must mooue man to loue and imbrace the true religio amp to coforme theselues in all good conscience to the rule of god word for when a man doth not so all the angels of god are his enemy and at all times readie to execute god vengeance vpon him but when me carrie themselues as dutifull children to god they haue this prerogatiue that god holy angels doe watch about them and defend them day and night from the power of their enemy euen in common calamities and miseries before god sends his iudgements on ierusalem an angel is sent to marke them in the foreheads that mourne for the abominations of the people and this priuiledge none can haue but he whose heart is sprinkled with the blood of christ and that man shall haue it vnto the end and thus much of the creation of angels nowe it followes to speake of the creation of man wherein we must cosider things i the points of doctrine ii the vses for the points of doctrine first man was created and framed by the hand of god and made after the image of god for moses brings in the lord speaking thus let vs make man in our image ampc in the image of god created he them which also must be vnderstood of angels the image of god is nothing els but a conformitie of man vnto god whereby man is holy as god is holy for paul saith put on the new man which after god that is in god image is created in righteousnes amp true holines now i reason thus wherin the renewing of the image of god in ma doth stand therin it was in the beginning but the renewing of god image in man doth stand in righteousnes and holines therefore god image wherein man was created at the beginning was a conformitie to god in righteousnes and holines now whether god image doth further consist in the substance of mans bodie amp soule or in the faculties of both the scripture speaketh nothing this image of god hath two principall parts i wisdome ii holines concerning wisdome paul saith put ye on the new man which is created in knowledge after the jmage of him which created him this wisdome consisteth in three points i in that he knew god his creator perfectly for adam in his innocencie knew god so farforth as it was conuenient for a creature to know his creatour ii he knewe god will so farre forth as it was conuenient for him to shew his obedience thereunto iii he knewe the wisdome and will of his creatour touching the particular creatures for after adam was created the lorde brought euery creature vnto him presenting them vnto him as being lord and king ouer them that he might giue names vnto them whereby it appeares that adam in his innocencie did know the nature of all creatures and the wisdome of god in creating them els he could not haue giuen them fit names amp when god brought eue vnto adam hee knewe hir at the first and saide this is nowe bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh shee shalbe called woman ampc the second part of god image in man is holinesse and righteousnesse which is nothing else but a conformitie of the will and affections and of the whole disposition of man both in bodie and soule to the will of god his creatour yet we must remember that adam in his innocencie had a changeable will so as he could either will good or euill he was created with such libertie of will as that he could indifferently will either and we must not thinke that the will of the creature was made vnchangeably good for that is peculiar to the will of god and hereby is the creatour distinguished from the creature and here two things offer them selues to be considered the first why the man is called the image of god and not the woman answer he is so called not because holines and righteousnes is peculiar to him which is common to both but because god hath placed more outward excellencie and dignitie in the person of a man then of a woma the second how christ should be called the image of god ans he is so called for causes first because he is of the same substance with the father amp therefore is his most absolute image and as the author of the hebrewes saith the brightnes of his glorie and the ingraued forme of his person secondly because god beeing inuisible doth manifest himselfe in christ in whome as in a glasse we may behold the wisdome goodnes the iustice and mercie of god the seconde point to be considered in the creation of man is the dignitie of his person for david saieth thou hast made man litle inferiour to the angells and crowned him with glorie and worshippe this dignitie stands in foure points i a blessed communion with the true god for paul speaking of the gentiles which were not called saith they were strangers from the life of god vvhere by the contrarie we may gather that our first parents in their innocencie liued the life of god which is nothing else but to lead such a life here on earth as that the creature shal haue a blessed and immediate fellowship with god which stands in this that before the fall of man god reuealed himselfe in a speciall manner vnto him so as his very bodie and soule was a temple and dwelling place of the creatour this fellowship betweene god and man in his innocencie was made manifest in the familiar conference which god vouchsafed to man but since the fall this communion is lost for man cannot abide the presence of god and therefore when peter had fished all night and caught nothing our sauiour bad him cast downe his net to make a draught who did so but when he saw the great multitude of fish that were taken at this sight beholding but as it were some sparkes of the glorious maiestie of god in christ hee fell downe at his feete saying lord depart from me for i am a sinner the second point wherein mans dignitie consisteth is that man was made lord and king ouer all creatures as dauid saith thou hast made him to haue dominion in the works of thy hands and therefore god hauing created him in his image he biddeth him rule ouer the fish of the sea ouer the foules of the heauen and ouer euery beast that mooueth vpon the earth and afterwarde hee brought them all to him as to a soueraigne lorde and king to be named by him and answeareably euery creature in his kinde gaue reuerence and subiection vnto man before his fall as vnto their lorde and king vvhere by the way wee must remember that when wee see any creature that is hurtfull and noysome vnto man and would rather deuoure him then obey him it must put vs in minde of our sinne for by creation we were made lordes and kings ouer all creatures and they durst not but reuerence and obey vs but the rebellion of man vnto god is the cause of the rebellion of the creatures vnto vs the third part of mans dignitie by creation is that before his fall he had a wonderfull beautie and maiestie aboue all creatures in his bodie whereupon dauid saith the lord hath crowned him with glorie and worship and in the renewing of the couenant with noe god saith that the dread and feare of man shalbe vpon all creatures which nowe though it be but small yet it plainly sheweth what was the glorie and maiestie of mans person at the first the fourth dignitie of mans estate in innocencie is that his labour was without paine or wearinesse if he had neuer fallen hee should haue laboured in the garden but so as hee should neuer haue beene wearied therewith that it is so it is plaine for when adam had falne god saide in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate thy breade nowe if the paine in labour come after as a curse vpon man for his transgression then before his fall man felt no paine in his affaires and in these foure thinges consisteth mans dignitie which he had in the creation now in the third place followeth mans calling before his fall which is two fold i particular ii generall mans particular calling was to come into the garden of eden to keepe it and to dresse the trees and fruits thereof this shewes vnto vs a good lesson that euery man must haue a particular calling wherein he ought to walke and therefore such as spend their time idlely in gaming and vain delights haue much to answer to god at the day of iudgement this will not excuse a man to say then that he had land and liuing to maintaine himselfe and therefore was to liue as he list for euen adam in his innocencie had al things at his will and wanted nothing yet euen then god imployed him in a calling therefore high and low none must be exempted euery man must walke in his proper calling adams generall calling was to worship his creator to which he was bound by the right of creation considering the morall law was written in his heart by nature vvhich is signified in the decalogue where the lord requires worship and obedience of his people because he is iehovah that is one which hath beeing in himselfe and giues beeing to all man by creation for the better vnderstanding of this point we are to consider three things i the place where adam did worship ii the time iii the sacraments for the first god euer since the beginning had a place where he would be worshipped and it is called god house which then was the garden of eden for it was vnto adam a place appointed by god for his worship as church assemblies are vnto vs where also the lord at time did in a speciall manner shew himselfe vnto his creature touching the time of god worship it was the seauenth day from the beginning of the creation the sabboth day and here we must note that the keeping of the sabboth is morall some indeede doe plead that it is but a ceremonie yet falsly for it was ordained before the fall of man at which time ceremonies signifying sanctification had no place nay marke further adam in his innocencie was not clogged with sinne as we are and yet then he must haue a set sabboth to worship god his creator and therefore much more neede hath euery one of vs of a sabboth day wherein we may seuer our selues from the workes of our callings and the workes of sinne to the worship of god in the exercise of religion and godly meditation of our creation this point must be learned of vs for when no occasion is offered of busines then man will formally seeme to keepe the sabboth but if their come occasion of breaking the sabboth as traffic gaming and vaine shewes then sabboth farewell man will haue their pleasures let them worship god that will but let vs remember in the feare of god that who so euer continueth in the breach of this lawe beeing morall god will no lesse poure forth his punishments vpon them then for the breach of any other commandement the consideration whereof must mooue euery man to a reuerent sanctifying of the lord day now for adams sacraments they were two the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and euill these did serue to exercise adam in obedience vnto god the tree of life was to signifie assurance of life for euer if he did keepe god commandements the tree of knowledge of good and euill was a sacrament to shew vnto him that if he did transgresse god commandements he should die and it was so called because it did signifie that if he trasgresse this law he should haue experience both of good and euill in himselfe now in the fourth place followeth the ende of the creation of man which is two fold first that there might be a creature to whome god might make manifest him selfe who in a speciall manner should set forth and acknowledge his wisdome goodnes mercie in the creation of heauen and earth and of things that are in them as also his prouidence in gouerning the same secondly god hauing decreed to glorifie his name in shewing his mercie and iustice vpon his creature hereupon in time createth man to shew his mercie in the saluation of some and to shew his iustice in the iust and deserued damnation of other some and therefore he hath appointed the creation specially of man to be a means of manifestation and beginning of the execution of his eternall counsell thus much concerning mans creation in generall the speciall parts of man are two bodie and soule and the reason why the lord would haue him stand on these two parts is this some creatures made before him were onely bodily as beast fish foules some spirituall as angels now man is both spirituall in regard of his soule corporall and sensible in regard of his bodie that nothing might be wanting to the perfection of nature if it be alleadged that man consistes of three parts bodie soule and spirit because paul praies that the thessalonians may be sanctified in bodie soule and spirit the answer is that the spirite signifies the minde whereby man conceiue and vnderstand such things as may be vnderstoode and the soule is there taken for the will and affections and therfore these twaine are not two parts but onely two distinct faculties of one and the same man the bodie of man at the first was formed by god of clay or of the dust of the earth not to be the graue of the bodie as plato said but to be an excellent and most fit instrument to put in exequution the powers and faculties of the soule and howsoeuer in it selfe considered it is mortal because it is compounded of contrarie natures called elements yet by the appointment of god in the creation it became immortall till the fall of man as for the soule it is no accidentarie qualitie but a spirituall and inuisible essence or nature subsisting by it selfe which plainely appeares in that the soules of man haue beeing and continuance as well forth of the bodie as in the same and are as well subiect to torments as the bodie is and whereas we can and doe put in practise sundrie actions of life sense motion vnderstanding we doe it onely by the power and vertue of the soule hence ariseth the difference between the soules of man and beast the soules of man are substances but the soules of other creatures seeme not to be substances because they haue no being out of the body in which they are but rather they are certain peculiar qualities arising of the matter of the bodie and vanishing with it and it may be for this cause that the soule of the beast is said to be in the bloode whereas the like is not said of the soule of man and though mens soules be spirits as angels are yet a difference must be made for angels can not be vnited with body so as both shall make one whole and intire person whereas mens soules may yes the soule coupled with the bodie is not onely the moouer of the bodie but the principall cause that makes man to be a man the beginning of the soule is not of the essence of god vnlesse we will make euery mans soule to be god neither doth it spring of the soule of the parents for the soule can no more beget a soule then an angel can beget an angel and adam is called a liuing soule and not a quickning soule and earthly fathers are called the fathers of our body and not of our soules it remaines therefore as beeing most agreeable to the scriptures that the soules of man are then created by god of nothing when they are infused into the bodie and though the soules of man haue a beginning yet they haue no end but are eternal and when they are said to die it is not because they cease at any time to subsist or haue beeing in nature but because they cease to be righteous or to haue fellowship with god whereas our body are god workemanship we must glorifie him in our body and all the actions of bodie and soule our eating and drink our liuing and dying must be referred to his glorie ye we must not hurt or abuse our body but present them as holy amp liuing sacrifices vnto god and whereas god made vs of the dust of the earth we are not to glorie and boast our selues but rather to take occasion to praise the great goodnes of god that hath vouchsafed to honour vs beeing but dust amp ashes and after that man is created what is his life alas it is nothing but a little breath stop his mouth and his nostrils and he is but a dead man by this we are put in minde to consider of our fraile and vncerten estate and to lay aside all confidence in our selues and for this cause the prophet esay teacheth vs to haue no confidence in man because his breath is in his nostrils againe let vs marke the frame and shape of mans bodie al other creatures go with their body amp eyes to the ground ward but man was made to goe vpright amp whereas all other creatures haue but foure muscles to turne their eyes round about man hath a fifth to pul his eyes vp to heaven warde nowe what doth this teach vs surely that how so euer wee seeke for other thinges yet first of all and aboue all wee should seeke for the kingdome of heauen and the righteousnesse thereof and that our whole desire should be set to enioy the blessed estate of god children in heauen secondly it teacheth vs in receiuing god creatures to returne thankfulnesse vnto god by lifting vp the heart to heauen for the same these are very needefull and profitable lessons in these daies for most man in deede goe vpright but looke into their liues and they might as vvell goe on all foure for in their conuersation they set their whole hearts vpon the earth as the beast doth and their eyes vpon the thinges of this worlde hereby they doe abase them selues and deface their body and beeing man make themselues as beast we shall see great numbers of man that runne and ride from place to place to prouide for the bodie but to seeke the kingdome of heauen where their soules should dwell after this life in ioy for euer they will not stirre one foote thirdly mans bodie by creation was made a temple framed by god own hands for himselfe to dwell in therefore our dutie is to keepe our body pure and cleane and not to suffer them to be instruments whereby to practise the sinne of the heart if a man had a faire house wherein he must entertaine a prince and should make hereof a swinestie or a stable would not all me say that he did greatly abuse both the house and the prince euen so mans bodie beeing at the first made a pallace for the euerliuing god if a man shall abuse it by drunkennesse swearing lying fornication or any vncleannesse hee doth make it in stead of a temple for the holy ghost to be a s ie or stable for the deuill for the more filthie a mans bodie is the more fit it is to be a dwelling place for sinne and sathan fourthly man by creation was made a goodly creature in the blessed image of god but by adams fall man lost the same and are nowe become the deformed children of wrath our dutie therefore is to labour to get againe our first image and endeauour our selues to become new creatures if a noble man should staine his blood by treason after his death the posteritie will neuer be at rest till they haue got away that spot man by adams fall is become a limme of the deuill a rebell and traytor against god maiestie and this is the state of euery one of vs by nature we are at enmitie with god amp therefore we ought to labour aboue all things in the world to be restored in christ to our first estate and perfection that so we may become bone of his bone flesh of his flesh beeing iustified and sanctified by his obedience death and passion fiftly man was created that there might be a way prepared whereby god might shew his grace and mercie in the saluation of some and his iustice in the deserued damnation of others for their sinnes and in the creation of man god eternall counsell begins to come into exequution hereupon it stands vs in hand to make conscience of euery euill way beeing repentant for all our sinnes past and hauing a constant purpose neuer to sinne more as we haue done that by our good conuersation here in this life wee may haue assurance that we be eternally chosen to saluation by the lord himselfe lastly whereas wee haue learned that the soule of man is immortall wee are hereby taught to take more care for the soule then for the bodie for it can not be extinguished when it is condemned euen then it is alwaies in dying and can neuer die but alas in this point the case is lat contrarie in the worlde for man will labour all their life long to get for the bodie but for the soule they care little or nothing at all chuse it whether it sinke or swimme goe to heauen or to hell they looke not to it this doth appeare to be true by the practise and behauiour of man on the lordes day for if the nomber of those which come to heare god worde were compared with those which runne about their worldly wealth and pleasure i feare me the better sort would be found to be but a little handfull to a huge heape or as a droppe to the ocean sea in respect of the other but wilt thou goe an hundred myle for the encrease of thy wealth and delight of thy bodie then think it not much to go ten thousand miles if neede were to take any paines for the good of thy soule and to get foode for the same and thus much for the duties nowe follow the consolations although by reason of the fall of man wee can haue but little comfort nowe yet the creation doth con rme the vnspeakeable prouidence of god ouer his creatures but especially ouer man in that the lord created him the sixth day and so before hee was made prepared for him a paradise for his dwelling and all creatures both for his vse and comfort and if he were thus carefull for vs when we were not then no doubt he will be much more carefull for vs at this present in which we liue and haue beeing nay marke further since the fall man eates and drink in quantitie a great deale which in common reason should rather kill him then turne to the strength and nourishment of his bodie yet herein doth the wonderfull power of the creatour most notably appeare who hath made mans stomacke as a lymbecke or styll to digest all meats that are holesome for his nourishment and preservation and thus much for the creation now in these words maker of heauen and earth is more to be vnderstoode then the worke of creation namely god prouidence in gouerning all things created as he appointed in his eternall decree and therefore saint peter saith god is a faithfull creatour that is god did not onely make heauen and earth and so leaue them as masons and carpenters leaue houses when they are built but by his prouidence doeth most wisely gouerne the same now therefore let us come to speake of god prouidence and first of all the question offers it selfe to be considered whether there be any prouidence of god or no for the mindes of man are troubled with many doubtings hereof and to make the question out of all doubt i will vse foure arguments to confirme the providence of god the first is the testimonie of the scripture which ascribeth the euent of all particular actions euen such as are in themselues casuall as the casting of lots and such like to the disposition of god which also teacheth that euen man themselues which are endued with reason and understanding haue neede to be guided in all things and gouerned by god and blameth those that denie god prouidence why sayest thou o iacob and speakest o israel my way is hid fro the lord amp my iudgement is past ouer by my god the secod argumet may be taken fro the order which appeareth in the whole course of nature first to begin with families there is to be seen an eutaxy or seemely order in which some rule amp some obey amp the like is to be found in townes cities cuntries and kingdoms yes euen in the whole world in which all things are so disposed that one serueth for the good of another trees and hearbs and grasse of the fieldes serue for beast and cattell and beastes and cattell serve for man the heauens aboue serue for them which are beneath and all the creatures which are aboue and beneath serue for god this argueth that god is most wise and provident in ordering and disposing all things whatsoeuer the third argument is taken from the conscience specially of malefactours suppose a man that commits a murder so closely that no man knowes thereof and that the partie himselfe is free from all the daunger of lawe yet shall he haue his owne conscience to accuse upbraid and condemne him yes euen to freight him out of his wit and to giue him no more rest then hee can finde upon the racke or gibbet nowe this accusation and terrour of conscience is nothing else but the forerunner of an other most terrible iudgement of god vvho is lorde of all creatures and iudge of all man and this also prooues the prouidence of god for if the conscience can finde a man out and lay his faults to his charge how much more shall god himselfe the creatour of the conscience see and consider all his doings the fourth and last argument is this the prophesies of things to come should be uncerten or false if god gouerned not the world but now considering things many yeeres agoe foretold come to passe in the same maner as they vvere foretold by the prophets and apostles hereby vve must certenly conclude that there is a prouidence of god vvhereby all amp euery thing is gouerned against the prouidence of god sundrie things be alledged the first and speciall is that prouidence and disorder confusion and order can not stand together nowe in the worlde there is nothing but disorder and confusion in seditions treasons conspiracies and subuersions of kingdomes vvhere also sinne and vvickednesse prevailes answere it is true indeed there hath beene confusion in the worlde euer since the fall of man and angels and it ariseth not from god but from them alone who as they did at the first transgresse the will of god so they doe what they can to turne all upside downe now then confusion and disorder is onely in respect of the deuill and his instruments but in regard of god in the very middest of all confusion there is order to be found because hee can and doeth dispose it to the glorie of his owne name and to the good and saluation of his chosen as also to the confusion of his enemy againe it may be obiected that with ungodly and wicked man all things goe well and contrariwise with the godly all things goe hardly for through the worlde none are more molested and more vnder outward miserie then they but if there were any prouidence of god then it should be otherwise the godly should florish amp the wicked perish ans the consideration of the outward estate of man in the world was to david an occasion of a sore temptation for when he savv the wicked to prosper alway and their riches to increase he brake foorth and said certenly i haue cleansed my heart in vaine and vvashed mine hands in innocencie now if vve would repell this temptation as david afterward did then vve must goe into the lord sanctuary with him amp learne to be resolued in these points i though the godly be laden with miseries yet euen that by the especiall prouidence of god turnes to their great good for euerie man since the fall of adam is stained vvith the lothsome contagion of sinne nowe the childe of god that is truly regenerate and must be fellowe heire with christ after this life in the kingdome of glorie must in this life be cast into the lord furnace that in the fire of affliction hee may more and more be scoured and purified from the corruption of his nature amp be estranged from the wickednes of the world ii the prosperous successe of the wicked their spoiles their reuenewes and all their honour turnes to their greater woe and miserie in the end as doth appeare in iobs historie and in the examples of the chaldeans of davids enemy and of dives and lazarus thirdly it may be obiected that many things came to passe by chance amp therfore not by god prouidece because chance amp providence canot stand together ans we must distinguish between chance amp mere chance chace is whe any thing comes to passe the cause therof being unknown not simply but in respect of man amp therefore in regarde of me which know not the reason of things we may say there is chance amp so the spirit of god speaketh time and chance cometh to them all and againe by chance there came down a priest the same way now this kind of chace is not against the prouidece of god but is ordered by it for things which in regard of man are casuall are certenly known amp determined by god mere chance is whe things are said or thought to come to passe without any cause at all but that must be abhorred of us as ouerturning the providence of god thus seeing it is plain that there is a providece let us in the next place see what it is prouidece is a most free amp powerful actio of god wherby he hath care ouer al things that are prouidence hath partes knowledge amp gouernment god knowledge is whereby all things from the greatest to the least are manifest before him at all times as david saith his eyes vvill consider his eye l ddes vvill trie the children of man and againe hee abaseth himselfe to beholde the things that are in the heaven and the earth and the prophet hanani said to asa the eyes of the lorde behold all the earth and s iames saith from the beginning of the vvorlde god knoweth all his workes this pointe hath a double use first as s peter saieth it must mooue us to eschew evill and doe good why because saith he the eyes of the lorde are upon the iust and his covntenance against evill doers secondly it must comfort all those that labour to keepe a good conscience for the eyes of god beholde all the earth to shew himselfe strong with them that are of perfect heart tovvardes him gouernment is the seconde parte of god providence whereby he ordereth all things and directeth them to good ends and it must be extended to the verie least thing that is in heauen or earth as to the sparrowes and to oxen and the haires of our heads and here we must consider things the maner of gouernment and the meanes the maner of gouernment is diverse according as things are good or euill a good thing is that which is approoued of god as first of all the substances of all creatures euen of the devil themselues in whome whatsoeuer is remaining since their creation is in it selfe good secondly the quantities qualities motions actions and inclinations of the creatures in themselues considered with all their euents are good againe good is either naturall or morall naturall which is created by god for the lawful use of man morall which is agreeable to the eternall and unchangeable wisdome of god revealed in the morall law now god gouerneth all good things two waies first by sustaining and preseruing them that they decay not secondly by moouing them that they may attaine to the particular ends for which they were seuerally ordeined for the qualities and vertues which were placed in the sun moone starres trees plantes seedes ampc would be dead in them and be unprofitable unlesse they vvere not only preserued but also stirred up and quickened by the power of god so oft as he imployes them to any use euill is the destruction of nature and it is taken for sinne or for the punishment of sinne now sinne is gouerned of god by two actions the first is an operative permission i so call it because god partly permitteth sinne and partly worketh in it for sinne as it is commonly taken hath two parts the subiect or matter and the fourme of sinne the subiect of sinne is a certaine qualitie or action the forme is the anomie or transgression of god law the first is good in it selfe and euery qualitie or action so farre forth as it is a qualitie or action is existing in nature and hath god to be the authour of it therefore sinne though it be sufficiently euill to eternall damnatio yet can it not be said to be absolutely euill as god is absolutely good because the subiect of it is good and therefore it hath in it respectes and regardes of goodnesse in respect of the second that is the breach of the lawe it selfe god neither willeth nor appointeth nor commaundeth nor causeth nor helpeth sinne but forbiddeth condemneth and punisheth it yet so as by withall he willingly permitteth it to be done by others as man and wicked angels they being the sole authors amp causes of it and this permission by god is vpon a good ende because thereby he manifesteth his iustice and mercie thus it appeares that in originall sinne the naturall inclination of the mind will and affections in it selfe considered is fro god and the ataxie or corruption of the inclination in no wise from him but onely permitted and that in actuall sinne the motion of the bodie or mind is from god but the euilnes amp disorder of the motion is not fro him but freely permitted to be done by others as for exaple in the act of murder the actions of moouing the whole bodie of stirring the seuerall ioyntes and the fetching of the blowe whereby the man is slaine is from god for in him we liue mooue amp haue our being but the disposing amp applying of all these actions to this end that our neighbors life may be taken away amp we thereby take reuenge upon him is not fro god but from vvicked man and the deuill god second action in the gouernment of sinne is after the iust permission of it partly to restraine it more or lesse according to his good will and pleasure and partly to dispose and turne it against the nature thereof to the glorie of his owne name to the punishment of his enemy amp to the correcting and chastisement of his elect as for the second kind of evill called the punishment of sinne it is the execution of iustice and hath god to be the authour of it and in this respect esai saith that god createth evill and amos that there is no evill in the citie which the lord hath not done and god as a most iust iudge may punish sinne by sinne himselfe in the meane season free from all sinne and thus the places must be understood in which it is said that god giueth kings in his wrath hardeneth the heart blindeth the eyes mingleth the spirit of errours giueth up man to a reprobate sense sends strange illusions to beleeue lies sends euill spirits giuing them comandement to hurt and leaue to deceiue ampc thus hauing seene in what manner god gouerneth all things let vs nowe come to the meanes of gouernment sometimes god worketh without meanes thus he created all things in the beginning and he made trees amp plants to grow and florish without the heate of the sun or raine sometimes he gouernes according to the usuall course amp order of nature as when he preserues our liues by meate amp drinke yet so as he can amp doth most freely order all things by meanes either aboue nature or against nature as it shall seeme good unto him as when hee caused the sun to stand in the firmament amp to go back in achas diall when he caused the fire not to burne the three children when he kept backe devve and raine three yere in israel when hee made water to flovve out of the rocke when hee caused elijah cloake to deuide the water of iorden when he caused iron to swimme when he preserued ionas aliue three daies and three nightes in the whale belly when he cured diseases by the strength of nature incurable as the leprosie of naaman the issue of blood and blindnesse ampc among all the meanes vvhich god useth the speciall are the reasonable creatures which are no passiue instruments as the toole in the hande of the workeman but actiue because as they are mooued by god so againe beeing indu d with will and reason they mooue themselues and such instruments are either good or euill euill as wicked man and angels and these he useth to doe his good vvill and pleasure euen then when they doe least of all obey him and considering that the inning instrument which is mooued by god doeth also mooue it selfe freely without any constraint on god part god himselfe is free from all blame when the instrument is blame worthy in directing the instrument god sinneth not the action indeede is of him but the defect of the action from the instrument which being corrupt can it selfe do nothing but that vvhich is corrupt god in the meane season by it bringing that to passe which is uerie good the whole cause of sinne is in satan and in us as for god he puts no vvickednes into vs but the evill vvhich he finds in us he mooues orders and gouernes and bends it by his infinite vvisdome vvhen and in vvhat maner it pleaseth him to the glorie of his name the euill instrument not knowing so much nay intending a farre other ende as in the mill the horse blind folded goes forward and perceiues nothing but that he is in the ordinarie way vvhereas the miller himselfe vvhippes him and stirres him forward for another end namely for the grinding of corne and this is that which we must holde touching god providence ouer vvicked man and angels and is standes vvith the tenour of the whole bible iosephs breethren sold him into egypt verie wickedly euen in the testimonie of their owne consciences yet ioseph having respect to the counsell and vvorke of god vvhich he performed by his brother saith that the lorde sent him thither and the church of ierusalem saith that herode and pontius pilate did nothing in the death of christ but that which the hand and counsell of god had determined to be done because though they wickedly intended nothing but to shevve their mallice and hatred in the death of christ yet god propounding a further matter by them then euer they dreamed of shewed forth his endles mercie to man in the worke of redemption on this maner must all the places of scripture be understood in which it is said that god gaue the vviues of dauid to absolon that god mooved david to number the people that he commanded shemi to raile on david that the medes and persians are his sanctified ones that the revolt of the ten tribes was done by god ampc by all these examples it appeares that we must not sever god permission from his will or decree and that wee must put difference betweene the euill worke of man and the good worke of god which he doth by man and the whole matter may yet be more clerely perceiued by this comparison a thiefe at the day of assise is condemned and the magistrate appointes him to be executed the hangman owing a grudge to the malefactour useth him hardly and prolongeth his punishment longer then he should nowe the magistrate and the hangman doe both one and the same worke yet the hangman for his part is a murder the magistrate in the meane season no murder but a iust iudge putting iustice in execution by the hangma so god though he use euill instruments yet is he free from the euill of the instruments and further we must here marke the difference vvhich must be made in god using of all kinds of instruments whe he useth good creatures as angels hee worketh his will not onely by them but also in them because hee inspires them and guides them by his spirite so as they shall will amp doe that which hee vvilleth and intendeth as for evill instruments he worketh by them only and not in them because he holdes backe his grace from them and leaues them to themselves to put in practise the corruption of their owne hearts thus much of the partes of god prouidence now follow the kinds thereof god prouidence is either generall or speciall generall is that which extendes it selfe to the whole world and all things indifferently euen to the devil themselues by this providence god continues and mainetaines the order which he set in nature in the creation and he preserues the life substance and the being of all and euery creature in his kinde the especiall prouidence is that which god sheweth and exerciseth towards his church and chosen people in gathering and guiding them and in preserving them by his mightie power against the gates of hell and therefore god church here upon earth is called the kingdome of grace in which he shewes not onely a generall power ouer his creatures but withall the special operation of his spirite in bowing amp bending the hearts of man to his will thus much concerning the doctrine of god prouidence now followes the duties first seeing there is a providence of god ouer euerie thing that is wee are hereby taught to take good heede of the transgression of the least of god commaundements if man were persvvaded that the prince had an eie every where doubtles many subiects in england would walke more obediently to the lawes of the land then they doe and durst in no wise worke such vilanies as are daily practised vvell howsoeuer it is with earthly princes yet this is least wanting in god he hath an eye euerie where wheresoeuer thou article there god beholdeth thee as dauid saith god looked downe from heauen upon the children of man to see if there were any that woulde vnderstand and seeke god therefore except thou be brutish and past shame take heed of sinne if man had but a sparke of grace the consideration of this would make them loath the practise of wickednes eliah saith to ahab as the lord god of israell liveth before whom i stand there shall be neither dew nor raine these yeres vvhere the prophet confirmeth his speech with an oth saying as the lord of hosts liueth it shall be so amp least ahab should thinke he made no conscience what he said he addeth this clause that he stood in the presence of god as if he should say howsoeuer thou thinkest of me yet as it standes me in hand so doe i make conscience of my worde for i stand in the presence of god amp therefore know it as the lord liueth there shalbe no raine nor dewe these three yeres so cornelius hauing an eye at god prouidence doth mooue himself amp all his houshold to a solemne hearing of the worde of god deliuered by the mouth of peter saying that they were all present before god to heare all things commaunded of him as these man had regard to god prouidence so we likewise must behaue our selues reuerently making conscience of our behauiour both in words and workes because wheresoeuer we be we are in the presence of god secondly if there be a providence of god ouer euerie thing then we must learne contentation of minde in euery estate in aduersitie under the crosse when all goes against us we must be content because god prouidece hath so appointed so david in the greatest of his griefes was dumbe and spake nothing his reason was because thou lord diddest it and vvhen shemei cursed dauid abisha would haue had the king to haue giuen him leaue to haue slaine him but dauid would not suffer it but said he curseth euen because the lord hath bidden him curse david who dare then say wherefore hast thou done so in whose example wee may see a worthy paterne of quietnesse of mind when a crosse commeth it is a harde thing to be patient but wee must draw our selues thereunto by consideration of god especiall providence thirdly when outward meanes of preseruation in this life doe abounde as health wealth honour riches peace and pleasure then we must remember to be thankfull because these things alwaies come by the prouidence of god so is iob thankefull both in prosperitie and aduersitie the lord saieth hee gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord indeede to be patient in every estate and thankfull to god is a verie hard matter yet will it be more easie if we learne in all things that befall us in this life neuer to seuer the consideration of the things that come to passe from god providence for as the bodie and the soule of man though we see onely the body are alwaies together as long as a man liueth so is god prouidence ioyned with the thing done wherefore as we looke on the thing done so we must also in it labour to see and acknowledge god providence as for example a mans house is set on fire and all his goods consumed this verie sight would make him at his wittes ende but now as he beholdes this euent with one eye so with the other eye he must at that verie instant looke vpon god blessed prouidence vvhen a man beholdes and feeles the losse of friends hee will be soone grieued if hee be not a verie stock or stone yet that he may not be ouerwhelmed with griefe hee must euer with one eye looke at the pleasure of god herein this practise will be an especiall meanes to stay the rage of any headstrong affection in all our afflictions in the vvorlde the manner of man is if health wealth and ease abound to thinke all is well but if crosses come as losse of friends and losse of goods then man crie out as being straught of their wits the reason is because they looke only at the outward meanes and shut up god prouidence in them amp can not see into the good will and providence of god out of all meanes againe when a man is stored vvith riches honour wealth and prosperitie he must not barely looke on them but behold withall god goodnesse and blessing in them for if that be wanting all the riches in the world are nothing likewise in receiuing thy meate and drinke thou must looke further into the blessing of god upon it which if it be away thy meate and thy drinke can no more nourish thee then the stone in the wall and the same must we doe in euery businesse of our callings which if man coulde learne to practise they woulde not so much t ust to the meanes as honour vvealth fauour ampc but to god himselfe the lord by the prophet habaccuc reprooueth the chaldeans for offer sacrifices unto their nets which sinne they committed because they looked onely vpon outward things amp like blind moles had no power to see further into them and to behold the vvorke of god in all their proceedings and this is the verie cause vvhy vvee are unthankefull for god benefites for though vve behold the bare creatures yet are vvee so pore blinde that vvee can not discerne any blessing and prouidence of god in them therefore let us learne to looke upon both ioyntly together and so shall wee be thankefull unto god in prosperitie and patient in adversitie vvith iob and david this lesson paul learned i can be abased saith he and i can abound every where in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry and to abound and to be in want fourthly seeing god prouiden e disposeth all things vvee are taught to gather obseruations of the same in things both past and present that vve may learne thereby to be armed against the time to come thus dauid vvhen hee vvas to encounter with goliah gathered hope and confidence to himselfe for the time to come by the obseruation of god prouidence in the time past for saith he when i kept my fathers sheepe i slevve a lion and a beare that devoured the flocke novv the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lyon and out of the paw of the beare he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistim fiftly because god prouidence disposeth all things when we make lawful promises to doe any thing we must put in or at the lest conceiue this condition if the lord will for s iames saith that we ought to say if the lord will and if we liue we will do this or that this also was davids practise for saith he to all the congregation of israel if it seeme good to you amp if it proceed fro the lord our god we will send to and fro sixtly seeing god prouidence is manifested in ordinary meanes it behooueth euery man in his calling to use them carefully amp when ordinary means be at hand we must not looke for any help without them though the lord be able to do vvhat he will without means ioab when many aramites came against him he heartened his souldiers though they were but fevv in number bidding them be strong amp valiant for their people amp for the cities of their god amp then let the lord do that vvhich is good in his eyes and our sauiour christ auoucheth it to be flat tepting of god for him to leap downe fro the pinacle of the teple to the ground wheras there was an ordinarie vvay at hand to descend by staires hence it appeares that such persons as vvill use no means vvherby they may come to repent amp beleeue do indeed no more repent amp beleeue then they ca be able to liue vvhich neither eat nor drink and thus much of the duties novv follovv the cosolatios first this very point of god special prouidece is a great cofort to god church for the lord moderateth the rage of the deuill and wicked man that they shall not hurt the people of god dauid saieth the lorde is at my right hand therefore i shall not and when iosephs breethren were afraide for selling him into egypt hee comforteth them saying that it was god that sent him before them for their preseruation so king dauid when his owne souldiers were purposed to stone him to death hee was in great sorrow but it is said hee comforted himselfe in the lord his god where we may see that a ma which hath grace to beleue in god and rely on his prouidence in all his afflictions amp extremitie shall haue wonderfull peace and consolation before we can proceede to the articles vvhich followe it is requisite that we should intreate of one of the greatest workes of god prouidence that can be because the opening of it giueth light to all that insueth and this worke is a preparation of such meanes vvhereby god will manifest his iustice and mercie it hath tvvo partes the iust permission of the fall of man and the giuing of the couenant of grace for so paul teacheth when hee saith that god shut up all under unbeliefe that he might have vpon al and againe the scripture hath concluded all under sinne that the promise by the faith of christ iesus should be given to them that beleeue touching the first that wee may rightly conceiue of mans fall we are to search out the nature and parts of sinne sinne is any thing whatsoeuer is against the will and vvord of god as s john saith sinne is the transgression of the law and this definition paul confirmeth when he saith that by the lavv comes the knowledge of sinne and where no lavve is there is no transgression and sinne is not imputed where there is no law in sinne wee must consider three things the fault the guilt the punishment the fault is the anomie or the inobedience it selfe and it comprehends not onely huge and notorious offences as idolatry blasphemie theft treason adulterie and all other crimes that the world cries sha e on but euery disordered thought affection inclination yes every defect of that which the law requireth the guilte of sinne is whereby a man is guiltie before god that is bound and made subiect to punishment and here two questions must be skanned where man is bound and by what for the first man is bounde in conscience and hereupon the conscience of every sinner sits within his heart as a little iudge to tell him that hee is bound before god to punishment for the second it is the order of diuine iustice et downe by god which bindes the conscience of the sinner before god for hee is creatour and lorde and man is a creature and therefore must either obey his will and commandement or suffer punishment now then by vertue of god law conscience bindes over the creature to beare a punishment for his offence done against god yes it tels him that hee is in daunger to be iudged and condemned for it and therefore the conscience is the lordes sergeant to infourme the sinner of the bonde and obligation whereby he is alwaies bounde before god the third thing which followeth sinne is punishment and that is death so paul saieth the stipend of sinne is death where by death we must understand a double death both of body and soule the death of the bodie is a separation of the bodie from the soule the second death is a separation of the whole man but especially of the soule from the glorious presence of god i say not simply from the presence of god for god is euerie where but onely from the ioyfull presence of god glorie now these two death are the stipends or allowance of sinne and the least sinne which a man committeth doth deserue these two punishments for in euerie sinne the infinite iustice of god is violated for which cause there must needs be inflicted an infinite punishment that there may be a proportion betweene the punishment and the offence and therefore that distinction of sinne which papistes make namely that some are in themselues veniall and some mortall is false amp hereby confuted otherwise in respect of man sinnes are either veniall or mortall veniall to the elect whose sinnes are pardonable in christ but to the reprobate all sinnes are mortall neuerthelesse we holde not all sinnes equall but that they are greater or lesse according to the diuersitie of obiectes and other circumstances thus much of sinne in generall now we come to the partes of it the first sinne of all that euer was in man is the sinne of adam which was his disobedience in eating the forbidden fruite in handling whereof sundrie pointes are to be opened but let us beginne with the causes therof the outward efficient cause was the deuill and though he be not named by moses in the historie of the fall yet that is not to trouble us for we must not conceiue otherwise of the serpent then of the instrument and mouth of the deuill for it is not likely that it being a bruite creature should be able to reason and determine of good and euill of trueth and falshood now in this temptation the deuill shewes his mallice and his fraude his malice in that whereas hee can not ouerturne god himselfe yet he labours to disturbe the order which he hath set downe in the creation amp especially the image of god in the most excellent creatures on earth that they may be in the same miserable condition with himselfe his fraud first in that hee beginnes his temptation with the woman being the weaker person and not with the man which course hee still continues as may appeare by this that exod a witch named in the feminine geder mechash shepha more woman are intangled vvith witchcraft and sorcerie then man secondly he shevves his fraude in that he proceedes very slily and intangles eue by certaine steppes and degrees for first by moouing a question he drawes her to listen to him and to reason with him of god commaundement secondly he brings her to looke upon the tree and wishly to vievve the beautie of the fruite thirdly hee makes her to doubt of the absolute trueth of god worde and promise and to beleeue his contrarie lies fourthly hauing blinded her minde vvith his false persvvasions shee desires and lustes after the forbidden fruite and thereupon takes it eates it amp giues it to her husband the invvarde cause was the vvill of our first parentes euen in the testimonie of their owne consciences as salomon saieth this haue i found that god made man righteous but they haue found many inventions but it may be obiected that if adam were created good he could not be the cause of his owne fall because a good tree can not bring forth euill fruite answer freedome of will is foure fold freedome to euill alone this is onely in wicked man and angels and is indeed a bondage the seconde is freedome to good alone and that is in god and the good angels the third is freedome to good in part ioyned with some want of libertie by reason of sinne and this is in the regenerate in this life the fourth is freedome either to good or to euill indifferently and this vvas in adam before his fall vvho though he had no inclination to sinne but onely to that vvhich was acceptable to god yet was hee not bound by any necessitie but had his libertie freely to chuse or refuse either good or euill and this is euident by the verie fourme of god commaundement in which hee forbids adam to eate the forbidden fruite and thereby shewes that he being created righteous and not prone to sinne had power to keep or not to keep the commandement though since the fall both hee and vvee after him can not but sinne wherefore adam being allured by satan of his owne free accord changed himselfe and fell from god now then as the good tree changed from good to euill brings foorth euill fruite so adam by his owne inward and free motion changing from good to evill brings forth euill as for god hee is not to be reputed as an authour or cause any way of this sinne for hee created adam and eue righteous indewed them vvith righteous vvilles and hee tolde them vvhat hee woulde exact at their handes and vvhat they coulde perfourme yes hee added threatnings that with the feare of daunger hee might terrifie them from sinne some may say vvhereas god foresavv that adam woulde abuse the libertie of his vvill vvhy vvoulde hee not preuent it ansvvere there is a double grace the one to be able to vvill and do that which is good the other to be able to persevere in vvvilling and doing the same now god gaue the first to adam and not the second and he is not to be blamed of vs though hee confirmed him not with new grace for he is debter to no man to giue him so much as the least grace whereas he had alreadie giuen a plentifull measure thereof to him and god did hold backe to conferre any further grace vpon iust cause i it was his pleasure that this fact should be an occasion or way to exercise his mercie in the sauing of the elect and his iustice in the deserued condemnation of impenitent sinners and vnlesse adam had fallen for himselfe amp others there should haue bin found no miserie in man on whome god might take pitie in his son nor wickednes which he might condemne and therefore neither manifestation of iustice nor mercie ii againe it was the will of god in part to forsake adam to make manifest the weaknesse of the most excellent creatures without the speciall and continuall assistance of god iii there is a double libertie of will one is to will good or euill this belongs to the creature in this world and therefore adam receiued it the other is to will good alone this he wanted because it is reserued to the life to come and though hee knewe no cause of this dealing of god yet is it one steppe to the feare of god for vs to hold that good and righteous which hee appointeth or willeth and not to square the workes and iudgements of god by our crooked reason and yet to come to reason it selfe who can here complaine of god can the deuill but god did not cause him to tempt or deceiue our first parents can adam and eue but they fell freely without any motion or instigation from god and their owne consciences accused them for it can the posteritie of adam but the elect receiue more in christ then they lost in adam and the reprobate ouerwhelmed with the burden of their owne sinnes and thereupon receiuing nothing but due and deserued damnation can not finde fault but some may further reply and say he that foreseeth an euill and doth not preuent it is a cause of it but god did foresee the fall of man and did not preuent it answer the rule is generally true in man that the foreseer of an euill not preuenting it is in some sort a doer of it for it is the sentence of the law of god to which man was bound from the first creation but god is aboue all his lawes and not bound to them he is an absolute lord and law giuer and therefore his actions are not within the compasse of lawes as mens are whereupon it follows that though he did foresee mans defection yet is hee free from all blame in not preuenting of it for with him there be good causes of permitting euill and though god be no cause of mans fall yet must wee not imagine that it came to passe by chance or fortune whereas the least things that are come to passe with god prouidence neither was it by any bare permission without his decree and will for that is to make an idle prouidence neither did it happen against the will of god he vtterly nilling it for then it could not haue bin vnlesse we denie god to be omnipotent it remaines therefore that this fall did so proceede of the voluntarie creation of adam as that god did in part ordaine and will it not as it was a sinne against his commandement but as it was further in the counsell of god a way to exequute his iustice and mercie against this which i say diverse things are obiected first that if adam did that which god in any respect willed then he did not sinne at all answer he that willeth and doth that which god willeth for all that sinnes vnlesse he will it in the same manner with god and for the same end nowe in the permitting of this fact god intended the manifesting of his glorie but our first parents intending no such thing sought not only to be like but also to be equal with god secodly it is alledged that adam could not but fall necessarily if god did decree it answer adams fall that came not to passe without god decree and therefore in that respect was necessarie was neuerthelesse in respect of adams freewil contingent and not necessarie god decree not taking away the will but onely ordering it lastly it is alledged that god will is the cause of adams will and adams will the cause of his fall and that therefore god will shall be the cause of the fall answer it must be graunted that god will is a moouing cause of the wills of euill man yet marke how not as they are euill wills simply but as they are wills and therefore when god inclines the euill will of his creature to his good purpose he is nothing at all intangled with the defect or euill of his will touching the time of the fall the receiued opinion in former ages hath bin that our first parents fell the same day in which they were created and therefore augustine writes that they stoode but sixe houres and though we can not determine of the certen time yet in all likelihood was it very short for moses presently after that he had set down the creation of man without the interposition of any thing else comes immediately to the fall and considering the nature of the deuill is without ceasing to shew his mallice no doubt he tooke the first occasion that possibly might be had to bring man to the same damnation with himselfe and our sauiour christ saith that the deuill was a manslayer from the beginning namely from the beginning nor of the creation of the world or of time but of man and eue saith we shall eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden it may be insinuating that as yet shee had not eaten when the deuill tempted her touching the greatnes of mans fall some haue made a small matter of it because it was the eating of an apple or some such fruit but wee must not measure the greatnes or the smalnes of a sinne by the obiect or matter whereabout it is occupied but by the commaundement of god and by the disobedience or offence of his infinite maiestie and that this fact of adam and eve was no small fault but a notorious cryme and apostasie in which they withdrawe them selues from vnder the power of god nay reiect and denie him will appeare if wee take a viewe of all the particular sinnes that be contained in it the first is vnbeleefe in that they doubted and distrusted of the trueth of god worde which hee spake to them the seconde is contempt of god in that they beleeued the lyes of the deuill rather then him for when god saith in the day that ye shall eate thereof ye shall die the death it is as nothing with eve but when the deuill comes and saith ye shall not die at all that shee takes fast hold on the third is pride and ambition for they did eate the forbidden fruit that they might be as god namely as the father the son the holy ghost the fourth is vnthankfulnes god had made them excellent creatures in his owne image that is nothing with them to be like vnto him vnlesse they may be equall vnto him the fifth is curiositie whereby they affected greater wisdome then god had giuen them in the creation and a greater measure of knowledge then god had reuealed to them the sixth is reprochful blasphemie in that they subscribe to the sayings of the deuill in which he charged god with lying and envy the seuenth is murder for by this meanes they bere ue themselues and their posteritie of the fellowship and graces of god spirit and bring vpon their owne heads the eternall wrath of god the eight is discontentation in that they sought for an higher condition then that was in which god had placed them in a word in this one single fact is comprised the breach of the whole law of god and wee should often thinke vpon this that we may learne to wonder at the iust iudgements of god in punishing this fall and his vnspeakeable goodnes in receiuing man to mercie after the same and here we must not omit to remember the largenesse of adams fall sinnes are either personall or generall personall are such as are peculiar to one or some fewe persons and make them alone guiltie generall that is common to all man and such is adams fall it is a sinne not onely of the person of one man but of the whole nature of man and adam must be considered not as a priuate man but as a roote or head bearing in it all mankinde or as a publike person representing all his posteritie and therefore when hee sinned all his posteritie sinned with him as in a parliament whatsoeuer is done by the burgesse for the shire is done by euery person in the shire as paul saith by one man sinne entred into the world and so death went ouerall for as much as all haue sinned and here lies the difference betweene adams fall and the sinnes of man as cains murder which makes not the posteritie of cain guiltie because he was neuer appointed by god to be the roote of his posteritie as adam was and therefore his sinne is personall whereas adams is not yet this which i say must not be vnderstood of all the sinnes of adam but onely of the first from the fall of adam springeth originall sinne not onely as a fruit thereof but also as a iust punishment of it and after the foresaid fall it is in adam and his posteritie as the mother and roote of all other sinne yet with this distinction that actuall sinne was first in adam and then came originall but in vs first is originall sinne and then after followes actuall originall sinne is tearmed diuersly in scriptures as the flesh the old man because it is in vs before grace concupiscence sinne that is readie to compasse vs about the sinning sinne and it is commonly tearmed originall because it hath bin in mans nature euer since the fall and because it is in euery man at the very instant of his conception and birth as dauid plainly saith behold i was borne in iniquitie and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me not meaning properly his parents sinne for he was borne in lawful marriage but his owne hereditarie sinne whereof he was guiltie euen in his mothers wombe but let vs search the nature of it considering it hath place in man it must be either the substace of body or soule or the faculties of the substance or the corruption of the faculties now it cannot be the substance of man corrupted for then our sauiour christ in taking our nature vpon him should also take vpon him our sinnes and by that meanes should as well haue neede of a redeemer as other man and againe the soules of man should not be immortall neither is it any one or all the faculties of man for euery one of them as namely the vnderstanding will affections and all other powers of bodie or soule were in man from the first creation whereas sinne was not before the fall wherefore it remains that originall sinne is nothing els but a disorder or euill disposition in al the faculties amp inclinations of man wherby they are all caried inordinatly against the law the subiect or place of this sinne is not any part of man but the whole bodie and soule for first of all the naturall appetite to meat and drinke and the power of nourishing is greatly corrupted as appeares by diseases aches surfetts but specially by the abuse of meat and drinke secondly the outward senses are as corrupt and that made dauid to pray that god would turne his eyes from beholding of vanitie and saint john to say whatsoeuer is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life thirdly touching the vnderstanding the spirit of god saith that the frame of the heart of man is onely euill continually so as we are not able of our selues to thinke a good thought and therefore withall the will of man and his affections are answerably corrupt and hereupon the doctrine of christ is that we must renownce our owne wills lastly all mans strength in good things is nothing out of christ the propagation of this sinne is the deriuing of it from adam to all his posteritie whereby it runneth as a leprosie ouer all mankinde but in what manner this propagation is made it is hard to define the common opinion of diuines is that it may be done two waies the first is this god when he created adam in the beginning set downe this appointment and order touching the estate of man that whatsoeuer adam receiued of god he should receiue it not onely for himselfe but for his posteritie and whatsoeuer grace of god he lost he should loose not onely to himselfe but to all his posteritie and hereupon adam when he sinned he did depriue first of all himselfe and then secondly all his posteritie of the image of god because all mankinde was in his loynes when he sinned now then vpon the former appointment when the soules of man are created and placed in the body god forsakes them not in respect of the substance of the soule or the faculties but onely in respect of his owne image whereof the soules are depriued after which followes the defect or want of righteousnes which is originall sinne and god in depriuing man of that which adam lost is not therefore to be thought to be the author or maintainer of sinne but a iust iudge for this depriuation of the image of god so farfoorth as it is inflicted by him vpon mankinde it must be conceiued as a deserued punishment for the sinne of adam and all man in him which they pulled vpon themselues the second way is that the corruption of nature is deriued from the parents in generation by the bodie for as sweete oyle poured into a fustie vessell looseth his purenes and is infected by the vessell so the soule created good and put into the corrupt bodie receiues contagion thence and this coniunction of the pure soule with the corrupt bodie is not against the goodnes of god because it is a iust punishment of the sinne of all man in adam it may be this which hath bin saide will not satisfie the mindes of all yet if any will be curious to search further into this point let them know that there is another matter which more concerns them to looke vnto when a mans house is on fire there is no time then to inquire howe and which way and whence the fire came but our dutie is with all speede and expedition to vse all good meanes to stay it and so considering that our whole natures are really infected and poisoned with the loathesome contagion of original sinne which is a weight sufficient to presse down the soule to the gulfe of hell it stands vs in hand a thousand fold more to the vse meanes whereby it may be taken away then to dispute how it came some may alleadge against the propagation of sinne that holy parents beget holy children which are void of originall sinne because it stands not with reason that parents should conveigh that to their children which they them selues want namely the guilt and the punishment and the fault of sinne in part answer i man are not in this life perfectly holy for sanctification is but in part and therefore they cannot possibly beget children pure from all sinne secondly parents beget children as they are man and not as they are holy man and by generation they deriue vnto their children nature with the corruption thereof and not grace which is aboue nature take any corne yes the finest wheat that euer was wi now it as cleane as possibly may be afterward sow it weede it also when it is sowne and reape it in due time and carrie it to the barne when it is thresht you shall finde as much chaffe in it as euer was before and why because god hath set this order in the creation that it shall spring and grow with the stalke eare blade and all so likewise though the parents be neuer so holy the children as they come of them are conceiued and borne wholly corrupt because god tooke this order in the creation that whatsoeuer euill adam procured he should bring it not onely on himselfe but vpon all his posteritie by vertue of which decree the propagation of sinne is continued without any interruption though parents themselues be borne anew by the spirit of god and here we must not omit to speake of the quantitie or greatnes of originall sinne for the opening whereof we must consider three points the first that originall sinne is not diverse but one and the same in kinde in euery man as the generall and common nature of man is one and the same in all man the second that this sinne is not in some man more in some man lesse but in euery man equally as all man doe equally from adam participate the nature of man and are equally the children of wrath some it may be will say that this can not be true because some man are of better natures then others are some of disposition cruell and seuere some againe gentle and milde some very licentious and disordered some very ciuill answer the differences that be in man that want the feare of god arise not of this that they haue more or lesse originall corruption but of the restraint and limitation of mans corruption for in some god brideleth sinne more then in others and in them is found ciuilitie and againe in some lesse and in such the rebellion of nature breakes foorth vnto all misdemeanour and indeede if god should not keepe the vntoward dispositions of man within compasse otherwhiles more otherwhiles lesse as it shall seeme good vnto his maiestie impietie crueltie iniustice and all manner of sinnes would breake out into such a measure that there should be no quiet liuing for man in the world and no place for god church and thus it is manifest that although all man be not equall in the practise of wickednes yet they may be equall in the corruption of nature it selfe the third point is that originall sinne is so huge and large euery way that it may truly be tearmed the roote or seede not of some fewe sinnes but of all sinnes whatsoeuer euen of the very sinne against the holy ghost we must not imagine it to be an inclination or prones to one or two faults but a prones to all and euery sinne that is practised in the world and that in all persons yong and old high and low male and female it is a most horrible villanie for a man to kill his father or his mother or his child yet some there be that doe so at the hearing whereof we vse to wonder and to testifie our dislike by saying that the doers thereof were wicked amp diuelish persons and it is truly saide neuerthelesse we must vnderstand that although we abstaine from such hainous practises yet the very root of such sinnes that is a disposition vnto them is found in vs also iulian the apostata both liuing and dying blasphemed christ herod and pontius pilate amp the wicked iewes crucified him and iudas betraied him man vse to say that if christ were now aliue they would not doe so for all the world but let vs better consider of the matter the same naturall corruption of heart that was in the is also in vs we being the childre of adam as well as they and by the force of this corruption if christ were now liuing on earth thou wouldest if like occasion were offered either doe as iudas did in betraying him or as pilate did deliuer him to be crucified or as the souldiers thrust him through with their speares or as iulian pierce him with all maner of blasphemies if god withhild his graces from thee and leaue thee to thy selfe in a word let man conceiue in minde the most notorious trespasse that can be though they doe it not nor intend to doe it nor neuer doe it yet the matter beginning and seed thereof is in themselues this made ieremie say the heart of man is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things who can know it it is like an huge sea the bankes whereof cannot be seene nor the bottome searched in common experience we see it come to passe that man protestant to day to morrowe papists of christians heretikes nowe friends but presently after foes this day honest and ciuill man the next day cruell murderers now what is the cause of this difference surely the hidden corruption of the heart that will thrust a man forward to any sinne when occasion is offered this point must be remembred and often thought vpon from originall sinne springeth actuall which is nothing els but the fruit of the corrupt heart either in thought word or deede thus much touching mans fall into sinne by god iust permission nowe followes the good vse which we must make thereof first by this we learne to acknowledge amp bewaile our owne frailtie for adam in his innocencie beeing created perfectly righteous when hee was once tempted by the deuill fell away from god what shal vve doe then in the like case vvhich are by nature sold vnder sinne amp in our selues a thousand times weaker then adam vvas many man there be that mingle themselues with all company tell them of the danger thereof they vvill reply that they haue such strong faith that no bad company can hurt the but alas silly people satan bevvitcheth them and makes them to beleeue falshood to be truth they knovve not their miserable estate if adam saith bernard had a dovvnefall in paradise vvhat shall vve doe that are cast foorth vpon the dunghil let vs therefore often come to a serious consideration of our ovvne vveaknes and follovv vvithall the practise of dauid vvho being priuie to himselfe touching his ovvne corruption praieth to god on this manner knit my heart to thee o lord that i may feare thy name secondly vve learne hereby absolutely to submit our selues to the authoritie of god and simply to resolue our selues what soeuer he commads is right and iust though the reason of it be not known to vs for eve condiscended to listen to the speach of the serpent and without any calling shee reasoned with it of a most v ightie matter and that in the absence of adam her head amp husband namely of the truth and glorie of god amp hereby was brought to doubt of god vvord amp so ouerturned thirdly if all man by adams fal be shut vp vnder danation there is no cause vvhy any of vs should stand vpon his his birth riches wisdome learning or any other such gifts of god there is nothing in vs that is more able to couer our vilenes and nakednes then figgetree leaues were able to couer the offence of adam from god eyes vve stand vnder the wrath of god by nature and cannot attaine to euerlasting life of our selues vvherefore it doth stand euery one of vs in hande to abase our selues vnder the hand of god in that we are become by our sinnes the very basest of all the creatures vpon earth yes vtterly to dispaire in respect of our selues and with bleeding hearts to bewaile our owne cases there is no danger in this it is the very way to grace none can be a sound member of christ till his conscience condemne him and make him quite ont of heart in respect of himselfe and the want of this is the cause why so fewe perceiue any sweetnes or comfort in the gospell and why it is so little loued and imbraced now adaies lastly if all mankinde be shut vp vnder vnbeleefe the dutie of euery man is to labour in vsing all good meanes whereby we may be deliuered from this bondage and to pray to god with david create in me a cleane heart o god and renewe a right spirite within me and cry out with paul o wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death and we must neuer be at rest till we haue some assurance in conscience that in christ wee haue freedome from this bondage and can with the colossians giue thanks that we are deliuered from the power of darknes and translated into the kingdome of christ this should be the affection of euery man because the spirituall thraldome vnder sinne is of all miseries most loathsome and burdensome and in this respect the day of death should be vnto vs most welcome because it doth vnloose vs fro this miserable estate in which we do almost nothing but displease god for this is the greatest griefe that can be to the children of god by their sinnes to offend their mercifull father and as for all those which feele not the weight of their naturall guiltines and corruptions but lie slumbring in the securitie of their hearts they are therfore the more miserable in that beeing plunged in the gulfe of all miserie yet they feele no miserie thus much of the permission of the fall of man nowe we come to the couenant of grace which is nothing else but a compact made betweene god and man touching reconciliation and life euerlasting by christ this couenant was first of all reuealed and deliuered to our first parents in the garden of eden immediately after their fall by god himselfe in these words the seede of the woman shall bruise the serpents head and afterward it was continued and renewed with a part of adams posteritie as with abraham isaac iacob dauid ampc but it was most fully reuealed and accomplished at the comming of christ in the couenant i will consider two things the parties reconciled betweene whome the couenant is made amp the foundation thereof the parties are god and man god is the principall amp he promiseth righteousnes and life eternall in christ man againe binds himselfe by god grace to beleeue amp to rest vpon the promise here it may be demanded why man is more in the couenant then angels answer the will of god in this point is not reuealed vnlesse it be because angels fel of themselues not mooued by any other but man did fall by them againe it may be asked whether all mankind were euer in the couenant or no ans we cannot say that all amp euery man hath bin amp now is in the couenant but onely that little part of mankind which in all ages hath bin in the church of god amp hath by faith imbraced the couenant as paul plainly auoucheth the scripture saith he hath concluded all vnder sinne that the promise of the faith of iesus christ should be giuen not vnto all man but to the that beleeue without faith no man can please god and therfore god makes no couenat of recociliation without faith again since the beginning of the world there hath bin alwaies a distinctio between ma amp man this appeares in the very tenor of the words of the couenat made with our first parents where god saith he wil put differece between the seed of the woma amp the seed of the serpet meaning by the seed of the woma christ with all the elect who the father hath giuen vnto him who shall bruise the serpents head and tread satan vnder their feete and by the seed of the serpent he meaneth wicked me that liue and die in their sinnes as saint john saith he that committeth sinne is of the deuill and according to this distinction in times following was abel receiued into the couenant and cain reiected some were the sonnes of god in the daies of noe some the sonnes of man in abrahams familie ismael is cast out and the couenant established in isaac iacob is loued esau is hated and this distinction in the families of abraham isaac and iacob paul approoueth when he maketh some to be the children of the flesh and some other the childre of the promise and again the iewes a people of god in the couenant the gentiles no people for paul makes it a priuiledge of the iewes to haue the adoption and couenants amp the seruice of god amp the promises belonging vnto them where as he saith of the ephesians that they were alients from the common wealth of israel and were strangers from the couenants of promise amp had no hope amp were without christ and without god in the worlde and the same may be said of the whole bodie of the gentiles excepting here amp there a man who were conuerted and became proselites and this is manifest in that they wated the word amp the sacraments and teachers and this saying of the prophet ose i will call them my people which were not my people and hir beloued which was not beloued is alledged by paul to prooue the calling of the gentiles some doe alledge to the cotrary that whe the couenat was made with our first parets it was also in the made with all mankinde not one man excepted amp that the distinction amp difference between ma and man ariseth of their vnbeleefe amp contept of the couenat afterward answer indeed in the estate of innocence adam by creation receiued grace for himselfe amp his posteritie amp in his fal he transgressed not only for himself but for all his posteritie but in receiuing of the couenant of grace it can not be prooued that he receiued it for himselfe amp for all mankinde nay the distinction betweene the seed of the woman amp the seed of the serpent mentioned in the very first giuing of the couenant shews the contrarie for if after the fall all amp euery part of mankinde were receiued into the couenant then all man without restraint should be the seede of the woman bruising the serpents head and the serpent should haue no seede at all and againe all man cannot be charged with vnbeleefe and contempt in respect of the couenant but onely such persons as haue knowne it or at the least heard of it and therefore sundrie heads of the nation may be charged with vnbeleefe as cain cham iaphet ammon moab ismael esau madian for they beeing neere to the fathers heard the promises concerning christ offered sacrifices and obserued externall rites of the church but afterward fell away from the syncere worship of the true god to idolatry and all manner of wickednes and became enemy of god amp his people but we plainly denie that there was or could be the like vnbeleefe and contempt of god grace in their posteritie which for the most part neuer so much as heard of any couenant their ancetors indeauouring alwaies to burie and extinguish the memorie of that which they hated it is obiected againe that the couenant was made with abraham and with all mankinde after him because saith the lord thou hast obeied my voice in thy seede shall all the nation of the earth be blessed answer paul giues a double answer first that the place must be vnderstood of many nation secondly that it must be vnderstood not of all nation in all ages but of all nation of the last age of the worlde for saith he the scripture foreseeing that god would iustifie the gentiles through faith preached before the gospell vnto abraham saying in thee shall all the nation be blessed vvell to conclude this point in the making of the couenant there must be a mutuall consent of the parties on both sides and beside the promise on god part there must be also a restipulation on mans part otherwise the couenant is not made now then it must needs follow that all vnbeleeuers cotemning grace offered in christ are out of the couenant as also such as neuer heard of it for where there is no knowledge there is no consent and before the comming of christ the greatest part of the world neuer knewe the messias nor heard of the couenant as paul saith to the learned athenians the time of this ignorance god regarded not but now he admonisheth all man euery where to repent the foundation and groundworke of the couenant is christ iesus the mediator in whom all the promises of god are yes and a man amp therfore he is called the angel of the couenant and the couenant of the people to be made with all nation in the last age nowe then that we may proceede at large to open the substance of the couenant we are in the next place to come to that part of the creed which cocerns the second person in trinitie set down in these words and in iesus christ his onely son ampc from which words to the very end of the creede such points onely are laid down as doe notably vnfold the benefits amp the matter of the couenant now the second person is described to vs by three things his titles his incarnatio his twofold estate his titles are in nuber foure i iesus ii christ iii his only son iv our lord his incarnatio amp his twofold estate are set down afterward to come to his titles the first is jesus to which if we adde the clause i beleeue on this maner i beleeue in iesus ampc the article which we now haue in hand will appeare to be most excellent because it hath most notable promises annexed to it vvhen peter cofessed christ to be the son of the liuing god he answered vpon this rocke will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it and again he that confesseth that christ is the son of god god dwelleth in him amp he in god and again to him giue all the prophets witnes that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes paul saith beleeue in the lord iesus and thou shalt be saued and all thy houshold thus then the confession in which we acknowledge that we beleeue in iesus christ hath a promise of fellowship with god amp of life euerlasting but it may be obiected that euery spirit as s john saith which confesseth that iesus christ is come in the flesh is of god now the devil amp al his angels amp vnbeleeuers do thus much therfore why may not they also haue the benefit of this cofessio ans by spirit in that place is neither met angels nor me nor any creature but the doctrine which teacheth that iesus christ is come in the flesh amp it is of god because it is holy amp diuine amp hath god to be the autor of it as for the devil amp his angels they can indeed confesse that christ the son of god was made man and a wicked man may teach the same but vnto the confession whereunto is annexed a promise of eternall life is required true faith whereby we doe not onely know and acknowledge this or that to be true in christ but also rest vpon him which neither satan nor wicked man can doe and therefore by this confession the church of god is distinguished from all other company of man in the worlde which beleeue not as panyms heretikes atheists turkes iewes and all other infidells this name iesus was giuen to the son of god by the father and brought from heauen by an angell vnto ioseph and marie and on the day when he was to be circumcised as the manner was this name was giuen vnto him by his parents as they were commanded from the lord by the angell gabriel and therefore the name was not giuen by chance or by the alone will of the parents but by the most wise appointment of god himselfe the name in hebrue is iehoschua and it is changed by the grecians into iesus which signifieth a sauiour and it may be called the proper name of christ signifying his office and both his natures because he is both a perfect and absolute sauiour as also the alone sauiour of man because the worke of saluation is wholly and onely wrought by him and no part thereof is reserued to any creature in heauen or in earth as peter saith for among man there is no other name giuen vnder heauen whereby we may be saued but by the name of iesus and the author to the hebrues saith that he is able perfectly to saue them that come vnto god by him seeing he euer liueth to make intercession for them if any shall obiect that the promises of saluation are made to them which keepe the commaundements the answere is that the law of god doth exact most absolute and perfect obedience which can be found in no man but in christ who neuer sinned and therefore it is not giuen vnto vs nowe that we might by our selues fulfill it and worke out our own saluation but that beeing condemned by it we might wholly depend on christ for eternall life if any further alledge that such as walke according to the commandemets of god though their obedience be imperfect yet they haue the promises of this life and of the life to come the answer is that they haue so indeed yet not for their works but according to their workes which are the fruits of their faith whereby they are ioyned to christ for whose merites onely they stand righteous and are acceptable before god and vvhereas it is saide by peter that baptisme saveth vs his meaning is not to signifie that there is any vertue in the water to wash away our sinnes and to sanctifie us but that it serues visibly to represent and confirme unto us the inward washing of our soules by the blood of christ it may further be said that others haue bene sauiours beside christ as iosuah the son of nun who for that cause is called by the same name with christ answer iosua after the death of moses was appointed by god to be a guide to the children of israel which might defend them from their enemy and bring them to the land of canaan but this deliverance was onely temporall and that onely of one people now the son of god is called iesus not because he deliuereth the people of the iewes onely or because he saueth the body of man only but because he saueth both body and soule not onely of the iewes but also of the gentiles from hell death and damnation and whereas prophets and ministers of the worde are called saviours it is because they are the instruments of god to publish the doctrine of saluation which is powerfull in mens hearts not by any vertue of theirs but onely by the operation of the spirit of christ lastly it may be obiected that the father and the holy ghost are sauiours and therefore not onely the son ansvver true it is that in the worke of saluation all the three persons must be ioyned together amp in no wise severed the father saveth the son saueth the holy ghost saueth yet must we distinguish them in the maner of sauing the father saveth by the son the son saueth by paying the ransome and price of our saluation the holy ghost saueth by a particular applying of the ransome unto man nowe therefore whereas the son paies the price of our redemption and not the father or the holy ghost therefore in this speciall respect he is called in scriptures and intituled by the name of iesus and none but he by this vvhich hath beene said the papistes are faultie tvvo vvayes first that they giue too much to the verie name of iesus for they write in plaine tearmes that the bare name it self being used hath great power amp doth driue away devil though the parties that use it be void of good affection whereas indeede it hath no more vertue then other titles of god or christ secondly they are faultie that they giue too little to the thing signified for christ must either be our alone and whole sauiour or no saviour now they make him but halfe a sauiour amp they ioyne others with him as partners in the work of saluatio whe they teach that with christs merits must be ioyned our works of grace in the matter of iustification and with christes satisfaction for the wrath of god our satisfaction for the temporall punishment and when they adde to christes intercession the intercession and patronage of saints especially of the virgin mary whome they call the queene of heauen the mother of mercie vvithall requesting her that by the authoritie of a mother shee would commaund her son if this doctrine of theirs may stand christ can not be the onely sauiour of mankinde but euerie man in parte shalbe iesus to himselfe but let us goe on yet further to search the speciall reason of the name which is notably set downe by the angell thou shalt saith hee call his name iesus for he shall save his people from their sinnes in which words vve may consider pointes i whome the son of god shall saue ii by what iii from what for the first he shall saue his people that is the elect of iewes amp gentiles and therefore he is called the saviour of his bodie vve must not here imagine that christ is a sauiour of all and euerie man for if that were true then christ shoulde make satisfaction to god iustice for all and every mans sinnes and god iustice being fully satisfied he could not in iustice condemne any man nay all man should be blessed because satisfactio for sin amp the pardon of sin depend one upo another inseparably againe if christ be an effectuall sauiour of all and euerie particular man why is any man condemned it will be said because they will not beleeue belike then mans will must over rule god will whereas the common rule of divines is that the first cause ordereth the second the meanes of saluation by christ are two his merite and his efficacie his merit in that by his obedience to the law and by his passion he made a satisfaction for our sinnes freed us from death and reconciled us unto god some may obiect that the obedience and the passion of christ being long agoe ended can not be able to saue us now because that which he did yeres agoe may seeme to be vanished and come to nothing at this day answere if christs obedience be considered as an action amp his passion as a bare suffering they are both ended long agoe yet the value and price of them before god is euerlasting as in adams fall the action of eating the forbidden fruit is ended but the guilt of his transgression goes ouerall mankind and continues still euen to this houre and shall doe to the ende of the world in those which shall be borne hereafter the efficacie of christ is in that hee giues his spirite to mortifie the corruption of our natures that we may die unto sinne and liue to righteousnesse and haue true comfort in terror of conscience and in the pangs of death the euils from which we are saued are our owne sinnes in that christ freeth us from the guilt and the punishment and fault of them all when we beleeue thus much for the meaning of this title iesus now followe the uses which arise of it first of all whereas wee are taught to make confession that the son of god is iesus that is a sauiour hence it must needs follow that wee are all lost in our selues and indeede before we can truly acknowledge that christ is our sauiour this confession must needes goe before that we are in truth amp therewithal do feel our selues to be miserable sinners under the wrath of god utterly lost in regarde of our selues for christ came to save that which vvas lost and vvhen he talked with the woman of canaan he checked her amp said he was not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of israel christ iesus came to poure oyle into our woundes christ came to set them at libertie which are in prison and to place them in freedome that are in bondage now a man cannot poure oyle into a wound before there be a wounde or before it be opened and wee feele the smart of it and how can we be set at libertie by christ except we feele us in our selues to be in bondage under hell death and damnation vvhen the disciples of christ were vpon the sea in a great tempest they cried master saue vs we perish so no man can heartily say i beleeue iesus christ to be my sauiour before hee feele that in himselfe he is utterly lost and cast away without his helpe but after that wee perceiue our selues to be in danger amp to be ouerwhelmed in the sea of the wrath of god then we crie out with the disciples lorde iesus saue vs wee perish many protestant in these daies hold christ to be their sauiour but it is onely formably from the teeth outward and no further for they were neuer touched with the sense of their spirituall miserie that they might say with daniel shame and confusion belongeth unto us and with the publican i am a sinner lorde be mercifull to me and therefore the conclusion is this that if we will haue christ to be our saviour we must first beleeue that in our selues we are utterly lost and so must that place be understood where christ saith he is not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of israel that is to those which in their owne sense and feeling are lost in themselues secondly if christ be a sauiour then we must acknowledge him to be so but how shall wee doe this i ansvver thus a man is taken to be a skillfull phisition by this that many patients come unto him and seeke for helpe at his hands and so should it be with christ but alas the case is otherwise every man can talke of christ but few acknowledge him to be a sauiour by seeking to him for their saluation because they iudge themselues righteous and feele not themselues to stand in need of the helpe of christ nay which is more if a man be knowne that can cure straunge diseases man will seeke to him by sea and lande and sell both goods and landes to get helpe at his handes euen so if man were perswaded that christ were a perfect sauiour and that they were sicke and utterly unable to be saued without him they vvoulde neuer rest nor be quiet but seeke unto him for his helpe and crie vvith dauid o lorde say unto my soule that thou article my salvation the woman that was diseased with an issue of bloode came behinde our sauiour christ and when shee had but touched him shee was healed in the same maner if wee shall seeke to come to christ and do but touch his pretious body amp blood by the hand of faith the issues and the bleeding woundes of our soules shalbe dried up when a man that had bene sicke yeres was come to the poole of bethesda hee was faine to lie there vncured because when the angell troubled the water euermore some stept before him but if we will seeke to christ for the saluation of our soules no man shall preuent us or step before us and if wee finde our selues to be so laden with the burden of our sinnes that we can not come to him let us then doe as the palsie man did he got man to carry him on their shoulders to the place where christ was and when they coulde not by reason of the prease of people enter into the house they opened the roofe and let him downe in his bedde by cordes to christ that he might be healed and so let vs vse the helpe of such as be godly that by their instructions and consolations they may as it were put too their shoulders amp by their prayers as with cordes bring us to christ that wee may receiue eternall saluation being otherwise deade in sinne and subiect to damnation lastly whereas ioseph and mary gaue this name not at their owne pleasure but at the appointment of god himselfe this ministers a good instruction to all parents touching the naming of their children when they are baptised that they are with care and deliberation to giue convenient names vnto them which may put them in mind of duties either to god or man this is worthy of our obseruation for many care not how they name their children yes it is at this day amp euer hath bene that some giue such names to them as that at the verie rehearsing thereof laughter ensueth but this ought not to be so for the name is giuen unto children at the time of their baptisme in the presence of god of his church and angels euen then vvhen they are to be entred into the church of god and that in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost therefore though we do not place religion in titles or names yet neuerthelesse a vvise and godly choise in this matter is to be had that the names imposed may be in stead of instructions and admonitions to the parties named and for this cause in the old testament names were giuen either by propheticall instinct or according to the euent of things which came to passe about the time of the birth of children or they were borowed from the holy auncetours to put the posteritie in mind to follow their steppes and thus much of the duties now follow the consolations that god church and people reape from this that the son of god is our saviour when as all mankind was included under sinne amp condemnation then the lord had mercy upon us and gaue unto man the couenant of grace in vvhich he promised that his owne son should be our redeemer this is a great and unspeakable comfort as may appeare in that the angels so greatly reioyced herein when christ was borne behold say they i bring you tidings of great ioy that shall be to all the people that is that unto you is borne i the citie of david a saviour which is christ the lord now if they reioyce thus exceedingly at christs birth who vvas not their sauiour because they stand not in neede to be redeemed then much more ought the church of god to reioyce herein whome it doeth principally concerne and no marvell for if this sauiour had not beene it had bene better to haue been a bruite beast or any other creature then a man for the death of a beast is the end of his woe but the death of a man without a sauiour is the beginning of endelesse miserie satan and his angels are fallen and haue no sauiour but when man was fallen god of his mercie dealt not so with him but gaue his ovvne son to restore him to better estate whereas he might as iustly haue damned all man for the fall of our first parents as hee did the wicked angels for theirs for god is not bound to any creature beholde then a matter of unspeakeable ioy let us therefore receiue and embrace christ our saviour flie to him for the pardon of all sinnes nowe vvee come to the second title of the son of god whereby hee is tearmed christ vvhich title is as it were the surname of the seconde person as some doe thinke yet according to the opinion of some others it is no name at all but onely a meere appellation as vvhen in the like case a particular man is called a duke or a king it is all one vvith messiah in hebrewe wherwith the redeemer was named in the olde testament and both signifie annointed among the iewes before the comming of christ three estates or orders of man were annointed with oile first of all kings as saul dauid and the rest of the kings of iuda secondly the priestes that serued in the tabernacle and temple before rhe lorde when they were ordained and as it vvere installed into the priesthoode were annointed vvith oyle as first of all aaron and his sonnes but aftervvard the high priests alone thirdly prophets were thus annointed as elisha now this legall annointing was a tipe and figure of the annointing of christ which was not with bodily oile but by the spirite and it was more excellent then all other annointings were for david saieth hee was annointed with the oile of gladnesse aboue all his fellowes signifying that neither king priest nor prophet was euer annointed in the same manner as he was christes annointing is according to both his natures for in what nature hee is a mediatour in the same hee is annointed but according to both his natures ioyntly hee is a mediatour the godheade is no mediatour without the manhoode nor the manhoode vvithout the godhead and therefore his annointing extendes it selfe both to his godhead and to his manhood christes annointing hath two partes both of them figured by the annointing of the iewes the first is his consecration whereby hee was set apart to doe the office of a mediatour betweene god and man and therefore to be a king a priest a prophet a king to gather and withall to gouerne his church and people a priest to make satisfaction and intercession for the sinnes of the elect a prophet to reveale and teach his people the will of god his father and though it be true that christ is set a part to the worke of mediation as he is mediator or as he is ma yet as he is god he doth designe and set himselfe apart to the same worke for to designe the mediatour is a common action of the persons the father the son and the holy ghost and yet cosidering the father is first in order and therfore hath the beginning of the action for this cause he is saide especially to designe as when s john saith him hath god the father sealed the second part of christes annointing is the pouring out of the fulnesse of the spirit or grace into the manhood of christ and it was particularly figured by the holy oile for first that oile had no man but god alone to be the authour of it so the most excellent and unspeakeable graces of the manhood of christ haue their beginning from the godhead of christ againe though the same oyle was most pretious yet was it compounded of myrrhe calamus and casia and such like earthie matters to signifie that the spirituall oile of grace whereof the manhood of christ was as it were a vessell or storehouse did not consist of the essentiall properties of the godhead as eutiches and his followers in these daies imagine but in certaine created gifts and qualities placed in his humane nature otherwise we should not haue any participation of them thirdly the sweete sauour of the holy oyle figured that the riches of all grace with the effect thereof in the obedience of christ doeth take away the noisome sent of our loathsome sinnes from the nosthrilles of god and withall doth make our persons and all our actions acceptable unto him as a svveete perfume as paul saith vve are unto god the sweete savour of christ ampc and christes death is for this cause tearmed a sacrifice of sweete smelling sauour and wee must further understand that these giftes of christes manhood are not conferred in a small scantling or measure for john saith god giveth him the spirite not by measure because the graces which are in christ are farre more both in number and degree then all man or angels haue or shall haue though the good angels and the saints of god in heauen are verie excellent creatures stored with graces and giftes of god for this cause christ is called the head of man because he is euerie way the most principall and glorious man that ever was yet for all this are not the gifts of christs manhood infinite any way because it is finite being a creature and therfore not capable of that which is infinite by christes annointing the people of god reape great benefite and comfort because they are partakers thereof for this cause the oile where with he was annointed is called the oyle of gladnesse because the sweet sauour of it gladdeth the heartes of all his members and brings the peace of god which passeth all understanding the holy oyle powred vpon aarons head came downe to his beard and to the verie skirtes of his garments and it signified that the spirituall oile of grace was first of all powred upon our head christ iesus and from thence consequently derived to all his members that by that meanes hee might be not onely annointed himselfe but also our annointer now the benefites which we receiue by his annointing are two the first is that all the elect when they are called to the profession of the gospell of christ are in and by him set apart and made spirituall kings priests and prophets as s john saith he hath made vs kings and priests vnto god his father and s peter out of ioel i will powre saith the lord my spirit vpon all flesh and your sonnes and daughters shall prophesie the second benefite is that all the faithfull receiue the same oile that is the same spirite of god in some measure which he receiued aboue measure as s john saieth the annointing which ye have received of him dvvelleth in you and teacheth you all things where by anointing is ment the holy ghost and hence it is that man are called christians of the name of christ that is annointed with the same oile wherwith christ was annointed and the holy oile might not be giuen to a stranger to signifie that to haue the spirite of christ and to be guided by it is peculiar to them that are christes now then let vs all lay these things to our hearts and extoll the unspeakeable goodnesse of god that hath advaunced vs to the dignitie of kings priests prophets before him and hath giuen his spirit unto vs to inable us to be so indeed nowe follow the duties which are to be learned hence and first whereas all christians receive annointing from the holy one christ iesus to become prophets in a sort wee must doe our endeavours that the word of god may dwell plentifully in vs and for that cause we must search the scriptures euen as hunters seeke for the game and as man seeke for golde euen in the mines of the earth there is nothing that is more unbeseeming a man then grosse ignorance a christian therfore the authour of the epistle to the hebrues reprooues them that whereas for the time they ought to haue beene teachers they had need againe to be taught the first principles of the word of god againe that portion of knowledge which we haue received of god is further to be applied to the benefit amp good of others this is that most precious baulme that on our partes should neuer be wanting to the heads of man and here euery man that is set ouer others must remember within the compasse of his calling and charge to instruct those that be under him so farre forth as possibly he can gouernours of families must teach their children and servant and their whole housholde the doctrine of the true religion that they may know the true god and walke in all his waies in doing righteousnesse amp iudgement if housholders woulde make conscience of this their dutie and in some sorte and measure prepare their families against they come to the publike congregation the ministers of the gospell vvith greater comfort and farre more ease should performe their dutie and see farre more fruit of their ministerie then now they doe but whereas they neglect their dutie falsely perswading themselues that it doeth not belong to them at all to instruct others it is the cause of ignorance both in townes and families in masters themselues in servant and children and all lastly by this we are admonished to take all occasions that possibly can be offered mutually to edifie each other in knowledge saying among our selues as it was foretold of these times come let vs goe up to the mountaine of the lord to the house of the god of iacob and he vvill teach vs his waies and we will walke in his pathes and withall we shoulde confirme each others as christ saith to peter when thou article converted confirme thy brother and be readie at all times to render an account of our faith and religion euen before our enemy vvhen wee are iustly called so to doe secondly because we are set apart in christ to become spirituall priests vnto god we must therefore offer spirituall sacrifices acceptable unto him and they be in number seven the first is an affiance whereby we rest upon god as dauid saith offer the sacrifice of righteousnesse and trust in the lord the second is wholly to subiect our selues to the ministerie of the gospell that wee may be changed and converted by it as paul saith that hee ministred the gospell to the gentiles that the offer vp of them might be acceptable beeing sanctified by the holy ghost the thirde is all manner of prayers and supplications made unto god let my prayer saieth david be directed in thy sight as incense and the lifting vp of mine handes as an evening sacrifice the fourth is praising and thankesgiving unto god let vs by him offer the sacrifice of praise alvvaies to god that is the fruite of the lippes vvhich confesse his name and in the revelation the golden vials full of odors are the praiers of the saints the fift is the reliefe of our poore breethren according to our ability as paul saieth i vvas even filled after that i had receiued of epaphroditus that vvhich came from you an odour that smelleth sweete a sacrifice ple sant and acceptable to god the sixt is the deniall of our selues with a contrite and broken heart the seuenth is to resigne our selues body and soules wholly to the seruice of god set your selues saith paul to god as they that are aliue from the dead and your members as weapons of righteousnesse unto god in which wordes he alludes to the manner of the old testament when a man offered any sacrifice for himselfe hee brought the beast into the temple or tabernacle and set it before the altar in token that hee did resigne it vnto god and so wee for our partes must not giue our body and soules to become the instruments of sinne amp satan but we must haue them alwaies in readinesse freely presenting them vnto him that he may haue the whole disposition of them according to his good pleasure to the honour and glorie of his name againe in the whole burnt offer all was consumed and turned to smoke no man hauing benefite of it to signifie that we must give our selues not in part but wholly to the service of god euen to death if need be if this be so miserable is the practise of such that giue up their body and soules to liue in licentious wantonnesse in the pleasures of their beastly sinnes in idlenesse for they offer themselues a sacrifice not to god but to the devill thirdly considering wee are annointed to be spirituall kinges euen in this life wee must walke worthie so great a calling that this may be so first of all such as are governours set ouer others must rule not according to their willes and pleasures but in the lorde withall doeing homage to their heade and king christ iesus him selfe secondly vvee must euerie one of vs rule and beare sway euen as kings ouer our owne thoughtes willes affections over mastering them as much as wee can by god worde and spirite withall maintaining and proclaiming continuall war against our corrupt natures the deuill and the worlde and truely hee which can beare rule ouer his owne heart is a right king indeede and hauing receiued some measure of grace to raigne ouer himselfe in this life he shall raigne for ever with christ in the life to come as for such as are carried away with the svvinge of their corruptions hauing blindnesse and ignorance to raigne in their mindes rebellion in their willes and affections loosenesse in their whole liues they may carrie the forme of christians as long as they will but indeede they are no spirituall kings but bondemen the strong man satan keepes as yet the hold of their hearts amp as lord and king holds up his scepter there lastly seeing christ is annointed with the most pretious baulme that ever was and that for our sakes he must be sweete and savourie unto us and all other things must be as vnsavorie drosse and dung in regarde of him vvee must in this case indeauour to say as the spouse of christ doth because of the savour of the good oyntments thy name is an ointment powred out therefore the virgin love thee o that we could savour in the feare of god that wee might perceive how all his garments smell of myrrhe aloes and cassia comming forth of his ivory pallaces vnto vs and because the holy ointment of christ is powred forth upon all his members to make them favourie and sweete in the presence of god let us make conscience of all maner of sinne lest by the poison and stincke thereof wee infect not onely our selues but all the creatures of god which wee vse yes heaven and earth itselfe it standes not with equitie that after we haue beene embaulmed and sweetned by the pretious merites of christ that we should make our selues as two footed swine to returne to the mire of our old sinnes the coupling and combining of these two former titles togither containes the principali question of the whole bible which is whether iesus the son of mary be christ or no as s john saith these things are written that yee might beleeue that iesus is the christ the son of god and that in beleeving yee might have life everlasting this conclusion was denied by the iewes but avouched and confirmed both by christ and by his apostles and their principall argument was framed thus he which hath the true notes of christ is the messias or christ indeed but iesus the son of mary hath the true notes of christ therfore iesus is christ the proposition is opened at large in the prophesies of the old testament the assumption is confirmed in the writings of the new testament amp the principall reasons of the confirmation are couched in the articles which cocern the second person the conclusion followes amp is set down as i haue said in the knitting togither of the titles iesus and christ thus much of the second title now followeth the third his only son that is the only son of the first person the father in this title we must consider things the first that he is the son of god the second that he is the only son of god touching the first christ is called the sone of god because he was begotte of the father now for the opening of this eternall generation we must consider three pointes the thing begotten the maner of begetting amp the time for the thing it selfe it is christ who must be cosidered waies as he is a son amp as he is god as he is a son he is not of himselfe but the son of the father begotten of him neuerthelesse as he is god he is of himselfe neither begotten nor proceeding for the essence or godhead of the father is of it selfe without all beginning but the godhead of the son is one and the same with the godhead of the father for by what godhead the father is god by the same and no other the son is god therefore the son as he is god hee is god of himselfe without beginning as the father whereupon it followes that the son is begotten of the father as he is a son but not as he is god the maner of this generation is this the son is begotten of the substance of the father not by any fluxe as when water is deriued from the head of the spring to the chanell nor by decision as when a thing is cut in pieces nor by propagation as when a grift is transplanted into a new stocke but by an unspeakeable communication of the whole essence or godhead from the father to the son in receiuing whereof the son doth no more diminish the maiestie or godhead of the father then the light of one candle doth the light of the other from which it is taken whereupon the councell of nicene hath said well that the son is of the father as light of light not proceeding but begotten the time of this generation hath neither beginning middle or ende and therefore it is eternall before all worlds and that is a thing to be wondered at that the father begetting amp the son begotte are coeternall amp therfore equall in time vvisdom in the prouerbs which with one consent of all divines is said to be christ affirmeth that she was before the world was created that is from eternity for before the world was made there was nothing but eternitie but it may be alledged to the contrarie that the saying of the father this day haue i begotten thee is expounded by paul of the time of christs resurrection answer we must distinguish betweene generation it selfe amp the manifestation of it amp of the second must the place be understood which may be brought to passe at the time of christs resurrection in which he was mightily declared to be the son of god though in the meane season the generation it selfe be eternall if any man alledge further that the person which begetteth must needs goe before the person begotten the answer is that there is a double priority one of order the other of time now in the generation of creatures there is priority both of order amp time but in the generation of the second person in trinity there is prioritie of order alone the father being first the son second without prioritie of time because they both in that respect are equall and neither is before or after other because the beeing or subsisting of the persons is not measured by time hence it followeth necessarily that iesus christ is true god amp the whole tenor of the scriptures confirme it sufficiently i he is made equall to god the father who being in the forme of god thought it no robberie to be equall with god amp all things that the father hath are mine the children of israell are said to haue tempted iehova and paul saith that he whome they tempted was christ iehoua founded the earth and the same is saide of christ ii christ the son of god is by name called god iesus christ is very god amp life eternall iii the properties of the godhead are ascribed unto him he is eternal because he was then when there was no creature in the beginning was the word and before abraham was i am he is omnipresent where tvvo or three are gathered togither in my name there am i in the middest amongst them lastly he is omnipotent whatsoever things the father doth the same doth the son also iiii the workes of creation and preseruation are as well ascribed to the son as to the father by him the father made the world and he beareth up all things by his mightie power and miracles which are workes either aboue or against the order of nature peculiar to god were done by christ v divine worship is given to him for he is adored invoted and beleeued in as god the father to him is given a name at which every knee doth bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things vnderneath the earth as for the reasons which be alledged to the contrarie they are of no moment i the worde of god can not be god the son is the worde of the father therefore hee is not god answer the worde is taken two waies first for a sounding worde standing of letters and syllables vttered either by god or by the creatures nowe on this manner christ is not the word of god secondly there is a substantiall worde which is of the substance of him whose worde it is and thus christ is the worde of god the father and he is so termed i in respect of the father for as reason amp speech hath his beginning from the mind without any passion in the mind so hath he beginning fro the father and as the speech is in the mind amp the mind in the speech so the father is in the son amp the son in the father in respect of all creatures the father doth all things by the son by whose powerfull worde the worlde was made is novv preserved amp shalbe abolished in respect of the church for the father by him speakes unto us both in the outward ministerie of the worde and by the inward operation of the spirit and againe we by him speake to the father ii it may be obiected thus god hath no beginning from any other christ hath beginning fro the father therfore he is not god answer christ must be considered both in regard of his godhead and in regard of his person in regarde of his god heade hee came not of any but is of himselfe as vvell as the father is yet in regarde of his person hee is from the father vvho is a beginning to the rest of the persons both in respect of order for the scripture saith not the holy ghost the son the father but the father the son the holy ghost as also in respect of the communication of the godhead and whereas it is said that god is of himselfe if the name god be taken for the godhead it selfe absolutely considered it is true but if it be taken for any particular person in the godhead it is false iii none is greater then god but the father is greater then christ for so he saith the father is greater then i ans christ there speakes of himselfe as he was a man abased in the forme of a servant in which respect he is lesse then the father who neuer was incarnate and abased in our nature and though christ in respect of his nature assumed be inferiour to the father yet doth it not hinder but that he may be equall to him as he is the second person in trinitie or as he is god by one and the same godhead with the father iv he that is made of god to be this or that is not god but christ is made of god as paul saith christ is made vnto vs wisdome righteousnes ampc answer christ is said to be made not because there was any beginning of his godhead or any chaunge or alteration in his person but because in the eternall counsell of the father he was set apart before all times to exequute the office of a mediatour and was withall in time called and as it were consecrated and ordained thereunto in his baptisme he is made therefore in respect of his office but not in respect of his person or nature v god hath no head christ hath an head as paul saith god is christs head answer god that is the father is head of christ not as he is god simply but as he is god incarnate or made manifest in the f esh and in respect of the office to which he willingly abased himselfe vi hee which giues vp his kingdome is not god christ giues vp his kingdome then saith paul shall be the end when he hath deliuered vp the kingdome to god euen the father answer christ is king two waies as he is god and as he is mediatour as he is god he raignes eternally with the father and the holy ghost but as he is mediatour in the ende of the worlde when all the company of the elect are gathered his kingdome shall cease not simplie but in respect of the tward manner of administration for the exequution of civill and ecclesiasticall functions shall cease and whereas in the same place it is said that christ shalbe subiect vnto god eternally after the ende it must be vnderstood partly in regard of the assumed manhood partly in respect of his mysticall bodie the church most neerely ioyned vnto him in heauen vii the first borne of euery creature amp of many brother is a creature amp not god but christ is the first borne of euery creature amp of many brother ans he is called the first borne by allusion to the first borne in the old testament for as they were principall heires hauing double portions allowed them amp the chiefe or gouernours of the familie so christ is made heire of the world and the head of god familie which is his church elected and adopted in him and againe he is called the first borne of euery creature because he was begotten of the substance of his father before any creature was made and therfore it is not here said that he was first created but first begotten by the reasons which haue bin alleadged as also by the insufficiencie of the contrarie arguments it is more then manifest against all heretikes that christ is very god yet to stoppe the mouthes of all atheists amp to satisfie all wauering amp doubtings minds i will adde one reason further the gospel of s john was chiefly penned for this end to prooue the dietie of christ amp among other arguments alledged this is one that christ gaue a resolute amp a constant testimonie of himselfe that he was the son of god amp very god now if any man shall say that sundrie persons since the beginning of the world haue taken vpon the amp that falsely to be god i answer that neuer any creature tooke this title amp honour vpon him to be called god but the fearefull iudgements of god were vpon him for it in the estate of mans innocencie the deuill tolde our first parents that by eating the fruite of the tree of knowledge of good and euill they should be as god knowing good amp euill now they beleeued him amp affected diuine honour but what came of it surely adam with all his posteritie is shut vp for it vnder eternall damnation herod likewise araied in royall apparell amp sitting on the iudgement seate made an oration to the man of tyre amp sidon who gaue a shout saying the voice of god amp not of man now because he tooke the glorie of god to himselfe amp did not returne it to him to who it was due immediatly the angel of the lord smote him and so if christ had bin but a meere man amp not very god as he auouched vndoubtedly the hand of god would haue bin vpon him likewise for his confusion but when he suffered for vs and bare the punishment due for our sinnes he most triumphed and the iudgements of god were vpon herod pontius pilate caiphas amp vpon all those that were enemy to him and to his church afterward amp that partly in life amp partly in death wherefore seeing that god can not abide that his glorie should be giuen to any creature amp seeing for that cause he takes reuenge on all those that exalt themselues to be god it remains that the testimony which christ gaue of himselfe that he was god is vnfallibly true amp without all question to be beleeued of vs and to conclude i would haue all the devil in hel with the cursed order of lucians porphyrians and atheists whatsoeuer to answer this one point howe it could come to passe that christ by publishing the doctrine of the gospell that is as contrarie to mans reason will and affections as water to fire should winne almost the whole world to become his disciples and to giue their liues for him vnlesse he were god indeed as he confessed himselfe to be there be sundrie speciall reasons wherefore it was necessarie that christ should be god i there is none which can be a sauiour of bodie amp soule but god i euen i am the lord and besides e there is no sauiour and i am the lord the god from the land of egipt and thou shalt knowe no god but me for there is no sauiour beside me ii there must be a proportion betweene the sinne of man and the punishmet of sinne now the sinne of man in respect of the offence of the maiestie of god is infinite in that he is infinitely displeased with man at the breach of his lawe therefore the punishment of sinne must be infinite and hence it followeth that he which suffereth the punishment beeing man must withall be god that the manhood by the power of the godhead may be supported that in suffering it may vanquish death and make a satisfaction iii he that must be a sauiour must be able to deliuer man from the bondage of their spirituall enemy namely sinne and satan to restore the image of god lost by the fall of adam and to conferre righteousnes and life euerlasting to defend them from hell death damnation the flesh the deuill the world to giue them full redemption from all their miseries both in bodie and soule and to place them in eternall happines all which none can doe but he which is very god iv it was the pleasure of god to shewe his incomprehensible goodnes in this that his grace should not onely be equall to our sinne but also by many degrees goe beyond it and therefore the first adam beeing but a meere man the second adam must be both god amp man that as the second was more excellent then the first so our comfort might be greater in our redemption by the second then our miserie and discomfort was by the fall of the first hitherto wee haue shewed howe christ is the son of god now let vs come to the second point namely that he is the onely son of god and he is so tearmed because he is the son of the father in that manner as nothing else can be but he angels indeede are tearmed the sonnes of god but that is onely in respect of their creation and all that beleeue in christ are the sonnes of god by adoption being receiued into the familie of god which is his church by the merit of christ whereas by nature they were the children of wrath christ also as he is man i say not his manhood which is a nature and no person is the son of god by the grace of personall vnion and not by nature or by adoption lastly christ as he is the second person in trinitie the eternall worde of the father coeternall and consubstanciall with him is also the son of god but how neither by creation nor adoption nor by the vertue of personall vnion but by nature as he was begotten of the very substance of the father before all worlds and therefore he is called the proper and onely begotten son of god it may be obiected on this manner if the father beget the son he doth it either willingly or against his will if willingly then the son is begotten by the freewill of the father and no son by nature answer the father did communicate to the son his whole godhead willingly without constraint yet not by his will and therefore he is the son of the father by nature not by will it may be further said that if christ be the son of god by nature as he is the essentiall word of the father amp by personall vnion as he is ma then is he not one but two sonnes answer as he is but one person so is he but one son yet not in one but in two respects two respects make not two things whereas one and the same thing and so remaining may admit sundrie respects thus much of the meaning of the third title now follow the comforts which may be gathered hence whereas christ iesus is the son of god it serues as a meanes to make miserable and wretched sinners that are by nature the children of wrath and damnation to be the sonnes of god by adoption as saint john testifieth now what a benefit is this to be the child of god no tongue can expresse christ saith blessed are the peacemakers but why are they blessed for saith he they shalbe called the sonnes of god whereby he testifieth that the right of adoption is a most excellent priuiledge and not without cause for he which is the childe of god is spiritually allyed to christ and to all the saints and servant of god both in heauen and earth hauing him for his elder brother and all his members as his brother and sisters yes if we be god adopted children we are also heires euen heires of god and heires annexed with christ well how great soeuer this prerogatiue is yet few there be that rightly waigh it and consider of it children of noble man and princes heires are had in account and reputation of all man they are the very speach and wonder of the world but it is a matter of no account to be the son of god and fellow heire with christ the dearest servant of god haue beene esteemed but as the offscouring of the world and no meruaile for they which are after the flesh sauour the things of the flesh fewe man haue their vnderstandings inlightned to discerne of such spirituall things as these are and therefore are they little or nothing regarded a blinde man neuer seeing the son is not brought to wonder at it and earthly minded man neither seeing nor feeling what an excellent thing it is to be the child of god cannot be brought to seeke after it but let all such as feare god enter into a serious consideration of the vnspeakeable goodnes of god comforting theselues in this that god the father hath vouchsafed by his own sone to make the of the vassals of sata to be his own deere childre now follow the duties which are two first we beleeue that iesus christ who was to be the sauiour of makind must needs be god what is the reason hereof surely because no creature no not all creatures in heauen and earth were able to saue one man so vyle wretched and miserable is our estate by adams fall and therefore the son of god himselfe pitied our estate and beeing king of heauen and earth was faine to come from heauen and lay downe his crowne and become a servant and taking vpon him our nature was also faine to take vpon him our case and condition amp suffer death for our sinnes which otherwaies euery one of vs should haue suffered both in bodie and soule world without end to make this more plaine let vs suppose that some one hath comitted an offence against a prince now the trespasse is so grieuous that no man can appease the kings wrath saue onely the kings onely son and which is more the kings son cannot release him vnlesse he suffer the punishment for him in his owne person which is due vnto the malefactour now what is to be thought of this mans estate surely all man will say that he is in a most miserable taking and that his trespasse is notorious and so it is with euery one of vs by nature whatsoeuer we are no man could saue our soules no not all the angels in heauen vnlesse the king of heauen amp earth the only son of god had come down from heaue amp suffered for vs bearing our punishment now the cosideratio of this must humble vs and make vs to cast down our selues vnder the had of god for our sinnes amp pray continually that the lord would send some moses or other which might smite the rocks of our hearts that some tears of sorow amp repentace might gush out for our woful miserie secondly whereas god the father of christ gaue his only son to be our sauiour as we must be thankfull to god for all things so especially for this great amp vnspeakeable benefite comon blessings of god as meat drink health wealth amp liberty must at all times mooue vs to be thankful but this that christ iesus the onely son of god redeemed vs beeing vtterly lost this i say must be the mayne point of al our thankfulnes but mens hearts are so frozen in the dregges of their sinnes that this dutie comes litle in practise now adaies our sauiour christ clensed ten leapers but there was but one of the that returned to giue him thanks amp this is as true in the leprosie of the soule for though saluation by christ be offered vnto vs daily by god ministers yet not one of ten nay scarse one of a thousand giues praise and thanks to god for it because man take no delite in things which cocerne the kingdome of heauen they thinke not that they haue need of saluation neither doe they feele any want of a sauiour but we for our parts must learne to say with david what shall i render vnto the lord for all his benefits yes we are to practise that which salomon saith my son giue me thy heart for we should giue vnto god both bodie amp soule in token of our thankfulnes for this wonderful blessing that he hath giue his only son to be our sauiour amp let vs know this for truth that they which are not thakfull for it let them say what they wil they haue no soundnes of grace at the heart and thus much of the third title the fourth amp last title is in these words our lord christ iesus the only son of god is our lord three waies by creation in that he made vs of nothing when we were not he is our lord in the ight of redemption in former times the custome hath bin that whe one is taken prisoner in the fields he that paies his ransome shall become alwaies after his lord so christ when we were bondslaues vnder hell death amp condemnation paid the rasome of our redemption and freed vs from the bondage of sinne and satan and therefore in that respect he is our lord he is the heade of the church as the husbande is the wiues head to rule and gouerne the same by his word and spirit and therefore in that respect also christ is our lord and thus much for the meaning now follow the duties if christ be our soueraigne lord we must performe absolute obedience vnto him that is whatsoeuer he commaunds vs that wee must doe and i say absolute obedience because magistrats masters rulers and fathers may command and must be obeyed yet no simply but so farfoorth as that which they command doth agree with the word and commaundement of god but christs will and word is righteousnes it selfe and therefore the rule and direction of all our actions whatsoeuer and for this cause he must be absolutely obeyed thus he requires the obedience of the morall law but why because he is the lord our god and in malach he saith if i be your lord where is my feare and againe we must resigne both bodie and soule heart minde will affections and the course of our whole liues to be ruled by the will of christ he is lord not onely of the bodie but of the spirite and soule of man hee must therefore haue homage of both as we adore him by the knee of the bodie so must the thoughts and the affections of our hearts haue their knees also to worship him and to shew their subiection to his commandements as for such as doe hold him for their lord in word but will not indeauour to shew their loyaltie in all manner of obedience they are indeede no better then starke rebels secondly when by the hande of christ strange iudgements shall come to passe as it is vsuall in all places continually we must stay our selues without murmuring or finding fault because he is an absolute lord ouer all his creatures all things are in his hands and he may doe with his owne whatsoeuer he will and therefore wee must rather feare and tremble whensoeuer wee see or heare of them so david saith i was dumbe and opened not my mouth because thou didst it and againe my flesh trembleth for feare of thee and i am afraid of thy iudgements thirdly before we vse any of god creatures or ordinances we must sanctifie them by the direction of his word and by praier the reason is this because he is lord ouer all and therefore from his word we must fetch direction to teach vs whether we may vse them or not and when and how we must vse them and secondly wee must pray to him that he would giue vs libertie and grace to vse them aright in holy maner also we are so to vse the creatures and ordinances of god as beeing alwaies readie to giue an account for them at the day of iudgement for wee vse that which is the lord not our owne we are but stewards ouer them amp we must come to a reckoning for the stewardship hast thou learning then imploy it to the glorie of god amp the good of the church boast not of it as though it were thine owne hast thou any other gift or blessing of god be it wisdome stregth riches honour fauour or whatsoeuer then looke thou vse it so as thou maist be alwaies readie to make a good account thereof vnto christ lastly euery one must so lead his life in this world as that at the day of death he may surrender and giue vp his soule into the hands of his lord and say with steven lord iesus receiue my soule for thy soule is none of thine but his who hath bought it with a price amp therfore thou must so order and keepe it as that thou maist in good manner restore it into the hands of god at the end of thy life if a man should borrow a thing of his neighbour and vse it so as he doth quite spoile it he would be ashamed to bring it againe to the owner in that manner and if he doe the owner will not receiue it vngodly man in this life doe so staine their soules with sin as that they can neuer be able to giue them vp into the hands of god at the day of death amp if they would yet god accepts them not but casts the quite away we must therefore labour so to liue in the world that with a ioyfull heart at the day of death we may commend our soules into the handes of our lord christ iesus who gaue them vnto vs this is a hard thing to be done and he that will doe it truly must first be assured of the pardon of his owne sinnes which a man can neuer haue without true and vnfained faith and repentance wherfore while we haue time let vs purge and clense our soules amp body that they may come home againe to god in good plight and here all gouernours must be put in mind that they an higher lord that they may not oppresse or deale hardly with their inferiours and this is pauls reason ye masters saith he doe the same things vnto your servant putting away threatning and knowe that euen your master is also in heauen neither is their respect of persons with him inferiours againe must remember to submit themselues to the authoritie of their gouernours especially of magistrates for they are set ouer vs by our soueraigne lord and king christ iesus as paul saith let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers for there is no power but of god and the powers that be ordained are of god and againe servant be obedient to your masters according to the flesh with feare and trembling in singlenes of your hearts as vnto christ the comfort which god church may reap hence is very great for if christ be the lord of lord amp our lord especially we neede not to feare what the deuill or wicked man can do vnto vs if christ be on our side who can be against vs we neede not feare them that can destroy the bodie and doe no more but we must cast our feare on him that is lord of bodie and soule and can cast both to hell thus much of the fourth title now followes christs incarnation in these words conceiued by the holy ghost borne of the virgin marie and they containe in them one of the most principall points of the doctrine of godlines as paul saith without cotrouersie great is the mysterie of godlines which is god is made manifest in the flesh iustified in the spirit ampc and that we may proceede in order in handling them i will first speake of the incarnation generally and then after come to the parts therof in general we are to propound fiue questions the answearing whereof will be very needefull to the better vnderstanding of the doctrine following the first question is who was incarnate or made man answer the second person in trinitie the son of god alone and it is set downe in this article according to the scriptures saint john saith the word was made flesh and the angel saith the holy one which shall be borne of thee shalbe called the son of the most highest and paul saith that christ iesus our lord was made of the seede of abraham according to the flesh and there be sundrie reasons why the second person should rather be incarnate then any other by whome the father created all things and man especially by him man beeing fallen is to be redeemed and as i may say recreated now man was at the first created of the father by the son and therefore to be redeemed by him it was most conuenient that he which is the essentiall image of the father should take mans nature that he might restore the image of god lost and defaced in man but the second person is the essentiall image of the father and therefore he alone must take mans nature it was requisite that that person which was by nature the son of god should be made the son of man that we which are the sonnes of man yes the sonnes of wrath should by grace be made the sonnes of god nowe the second person alone is the son of god by nature not the father nor the holy ghost as for the father he could not be incarnate for to take flesh is to be sent of an other but the father cannot be sent of any person because hee is from none againe if the father were incarnate hee should be father to him which is by nature god and the son of a creature namely the virgin marie which thinges can not well stand and the holy ghost could not be incarnate for then there should be more sonnes then one in the trinitie namely the second person the son of the father and the third person the holy ghost the son of the virgin marie it may be obiected to the contrarie on this manner the whole diuine essence is incarnate euery person in trinitie is the whole diuine essence therefore euery person is incarnate answer the whole godhead indeede is incarnate yet not as it is absolutely considered but so farfoorth as it is restrained and limited to the person of the son and to speake properly the godheade it selfe is not incarnate but the very person of the son subsisting in the godhead and though all the persons be one and the same essence yet doe they really differ each from other in regard of the peculiar manner of subsisting and therefore mans nature may be assumed of the second person and be not assumed either of the father or of the holy ghost as in the like case the soule of man is wholly in the head and wholly in the feet yes wholly in euery part and yet the soule can not be said to vse reason in the feete or in any other part but onely in the head againe it may be alledged that the incarnation beeing an outward action of god to the creature is not proper to the son for the rule is that all outward actions of god are common to al the persons in trinitie equally ans the incarnation stands of two actions the first is the framing amp creating of that manhoode which was to be assumed by christ amp this is comon to all the three persons equally the second is the limiting or the receiuing of it into the vnitie of any person and in respect of this action the worke of incarnation is peculiar to the son to this purpose augustine speaketh that creature which the virgin conceiued amp br ught foorth though it appertaine to the person of the son alone yet was it made by the whole trinitie as whe three me weaue one and the same garment and the second onely weares it the second question is what manner of man the son of god was made ans he was made a proper or particular man and a perfect or a very man i say that he was a particular man to shew that he tooke not vnto him the generall forme or idea of mans nature coceiued onely in mind nor the comon nature of man as it is existing in euery man but the whole nature of man that is both a bodie and a reasonable soule existing in in vno individ o one particular subiect i say further that he was and is a true and perfect man beeing in euery thing that concerns mans nature like to adam abraham dauid and all other man sauing onely in sinne for first of all hee had the substance of a true bodie and of a reasonable soule secondly the properties of bodie amp soule in the body length breadth thicknes circumscription ampc n the soule the faculties of vnderstanding both simply and compounde will affections as loue hatred desire ioy feare ampc the powers also of hearing feeling seeing smelling tasting moouing growing eating digesting sleeping ampc thirdly he tooke vnto him the infirmities of mans nature which are certaine naturall defects or passions in bodie or minde as to be hungrie thirstie wearie sadde and sorowfull ignorant of some things angrie to increase in stature and wisdome and knowledge ampc yet this which i say must be vnderstood with two caveats the first is that infirmities be either certaine vnblameable passions or else such defects as are sinnes in themselues nowe christ takes the first onely and not the second secondly infirmities be either generall or personall generall which appertaine to the whole nature of man and are to be found in euery man that comes of adam as to be borne vnlearned and subiect to naturall affections as sorrowe anger ampc personall are such as appertaine to some particular man and not to all and arise of some priuate causes and particular iudgements of god as to be borne a foole to be sicke of an ague consumption dropsie pleuresie and such like diseases now the first sort be in christ and not the second for as he tooke not the person of any man but onely mans nature so was it sufficient for him to take vnto him the infirmities of mans nature though hee tooke not the priuate infirmities of any mans person and the reason why christ would put on not onely the substance and faculties of a true man but also his infirmities was that hee might shewe him selfe to be very man indeed also that he might suffer for vs both in bodie and soule and that he might giue vs an example of patience in bearing all manner of euill for god glorie and the good of our neighbour now the things which may be alleadged to the contrarie for the infringing of the truth of christs manhood are of no moment as first because christ appeared in the forme of a man in the old testament beeing no man therefore he did so at his comming in the newe testament but the reason is not like for christ in the old testament as the angell of his father in some speciall affaires tooke vnto him the bodie of a man for some space of time but he did not receiue it into the vnitie of his person but laid it downe when the busines which he enterprised with man was ended now in the fulnes of time he came from heauen as the angell of the covenant and for that cause he was to vnite into his owne person the nature of man and when as paul saith that christ came in the similitude of sinnefull flesh his meaning is not to signifie that he was a man onely in resemblance and shewe but to testifie that beeing a true man indeede void of sinne was content to abase himselfe to that condition in which he became like to a miserable sinner in bearing the punishment for our sinne for paul doth not say that he tooke vpon him the similitude of flesh simply as it is flesh but of the flesh of sinne or sinnefull flesh the third question is why the son of god must become man answer there be sundrie reasons of this point and the most principall are these first of all it is a thing that greatly standes with the iustice of god that in that nature in which god was offended in the same should be a made satisfaction to god for sinne nowe sinne was committed in mans nature adam sinned first and in him all his posteritie therefore it is very necessarie that in mans nature there should be a satisfaction made to god iustice and therefore the son of god must needes abase himselfe and become man for our sakes secondly by the right of creation euery man is bounde in conscience to fulfull euen the very rigour and extremitie of the morall lawe but considering man is nowe fallen from his first estate and condition therefore it was requisite that the son of god should become man that in mans nature hee might fulfill all righteousnes which the law doth exact at our handes thirdly hee that is our redeemer must die for our sinnes for their is no remission of sinnes without shedding of bloode but christ as he is god can not die for no passion can befall the godhead therefore it was needefull that hee should become man that in mans nature hee might die and fully satisfie god iustice for mans offence lastly hee that must make reconciliation betweene god and man must be such an one as may make request or speake both to god and man for a mediatour is as it were a middle person making intercession betweene two other persons the one offended the other offending therefore it is necessarie that christ should not onely be god to speake vnto the father for vs and to present our praiers vnto him but also man that god might speake to vs and we to god by christ for howsoeuer before the fal man could speake to god euen face to face yet since the fall such feare possesseth mans corrupt nature that he cannot abide the presence of god but flieth from it nowe whereas i say that it was necessarie that the son of god for the causes before alleadged must become man the necessitie must be vnderstood in respect of god will and not in respect of his power for if it had so pleased god hee was able to haue laide downe an other kinde of way of mans redemption then by the incarnation of the son of god and he appointed no other way because he would not thus much of the incarnation in generall now followe the duties vvhich arise of it and first vvee are taught hereby to come to christ by faith and vvith all our heartes to cleaue unto him great is the deadnesse and sluggishnesse of mans nature for scarse one of a thousande cares for him or seekes unto him for righteousnesse and life euerlasting but wee shoulde excite our selues euerie vvay to dravve neare to him as much as possibly vvee may for when hee was incarnate hee came neare unto us by taking our nature upon him that wee againe whatsoeuer wee are might come neare unto him by taking unto us his divine nature againe when christ was incarnate he was made bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh amp therfore proportionally we must labour to become bone of his bone amp flesh of his flesh which we shall be when we are mistically united unto him by faith amp born anew by his spirit moreouer christ by his incarnation came down fro heauen to vs that we being partakers of his grace might ascend vp to heauen by him and thus we see how the meditation of christs incarnation should be a spurre to pricke vs forwarde still more and more to come to christ secondly christs incarnation must be a patterne vnto vs of a most wonderfull and straunge humilitie for as paul saith beeing in the forme of god and thinking it no robberie to be equall with god made himselfe of no reputation and tooke on him the forme of a servant and humbled himselfe and became obedient to death euen to the death of the crosse yes so farrefoorth abased hee himselfe that as david saith he was a worme and no man and this teacheth vs to lay aside all selfe loue and pride of heart and to practise the dueties of humilitie as the apostle exhorts the philippians in the same place and that shall wee doe when we beginne to cast off that high opinion which euery man by nature conceiueth of himselfe amp become vile amp base in our own eyes secure and drowsie protestant thinke themselues blessed and say in their hearts as the angell of the church of laodicea said i am rich and increased with golde and haue neede of nothing whereas indeede they are most miserable and wretched and poore and naked and blinde and the same fond opinion possesseth the mindes of our ignorant people who chaunt it in the very same tune saying that god loues them and that they loue god with all their hearts and their neighbours as them selues that they haue perfect faith in christ and euer had not once so much as doubting of their saluation that all is well with them and that they are past all daunger whatsoeuer in the matter of their saluation and therefore neede not take so much care for it thus ye may see how man are commonly carried away with vain and fond conceits of their own excellencie and truely so long as this ouerweening of our owne righteousnes raignes in our hearts let preachers speake and say what they will wee will neuer become followers of christ in the practise of humilitie some will say peradventure that they neuer had any such opinion of their owne righteousnesse but i answeare againe that there was never yet any man descending of adam saue christ but hee had this proude phantasie ruling and raigning in him till such time as god giue grace to chaunge and altar his heart and this inwarde pride the lesse wee discerne it the more it is and the more we discerne it the lesse it is therefore though as yet thou see it not in thy selfe yet labour both to see it and to feele it and to striue against it casting downe thy selfe for thine owne miserie after christes owne example who beeing god abased him selfe to the condition of a miserable man for thou shalt neuer be filled with the good things of god till thou be emptied of selfe loue and selfe liking for this cause let us purge and emptie our selues of all conceit of our owne righteousnesse that god may fill our heartes with his grace furthermore the incarnation of christ is the ground and foundation of all our comforte as the names of christ seruing to expresse the same doe testifie iaakob in his last testament saieth that the scepter shall not depart from iudah till shilo that is the messias come now the name shilo signifieth the tunicle or skinne that lappeth the infante in the mothers wombe called by the phisitians the secundine and by a kinde of figure it is put for the son of god in the wombe of the virgine made man and iob to comforte him selfe in his affliction saieth i knovve that my redeemer liveth now the worde which he useth to signifie his redeemer by is verie emphaticall for it signifieth a kinsman neere allyed vnto him of his owne flesh that will restore him to life and the lorde by the prophet esai calleth christ immanuel that is god with vs which name importeth verie much namely that whereas by nature we haue lost our fellowshippe with god because our sinnes are a wall of partition severing vs from him yet neverthelesse the same is restored to all that beleeue by the mediatour christ iesus because his divine nature is coupled to mans nature and so the word is made flesh and this strait coniunction of two natures into one person ioynes god to man and man to god yes by christ wee are brought to god and haue free accesse unto him and againe in him wee apprehend god and are made one with him and further whereas christ beside our nature tooke our infirmities also it is a wonderfull comforte unto god church for it shewes that hee is not onely a sauiour but also a verie compassionate and pitifull sauiour as the holy ghost saith in all things it became christ to be like vnto his breethren that hee might be mercifull and a faithfull high priest in things concerning god let a man be sicke of a grievous disease and if a friend come that hath hene troubled with the same disease hee will shewe more compassion then twentie others and so christ hauing felt in his owne soule and bodie the anguish and the manifolde perplexities that wee feele in our temptations and afflictions hath his bowels as it were earning towards vs euermore being prest and readie to relieve vs in all our miseries in the daies of his flesh he wept ouer ierusalem when he saw it a farre off because she continued in her old sins amp did not know the time of her visitation and no doubt though now hee be exalted in glorie in heauen yet his compassion to his poore members upon earth is no whit diminished nowe wee come to speake of the incarnation more particularly and the creede yet further expresseth it by two partes the first is the conception of christ in these wordes conceived by the holy ghost the second is his birth in the words following borne of the virgine mary the conception of christ is set downe with his efficient cause the holy ghost as the angell saide to ioseph feare not to take marie for thy wife for that vvhich is conceived in her is of the holy ghost here it may be demanded why the conception of christ shoulde be ascribed to the holy ghost alone which is common to all the persons in trinitie as all other such actions are ansvvere it is not done to exclude the father or the son himselfe from this worke but to signifie that it comes of the free gifte and grace of god which commonly is tearmed by the name of the holy ghost that the manhoode of christ being but a creature shoulde be advaunced to this dignitie that it shoulde become a parte of the son of god and againe the holy ghost is the authour of this conception in a speciall manner for the father and the son did cause it by the holy ghost but the holy ghost did cause it from them both immediatly in the conception of christ wee must obserue and consider three things the framing of the manhoode the sanctifying of it and the personall union of the manhoode with the godheade and howsoeuer i distinguish these three for orders sake yet must wee knowe and remember that they are all wrought at one and the same instant of time for when the holy ghost frames and sanctifies the manhood in the wombe of the virgine at the verie same moment it is receiued into the unitie of the second person in the forming of christes manhoode two things must be considered the matter and the maner the matter of his body was the very flesh and bloud of the virgine marie otherwise he could not haue beene the son of david of abraham and adam according to the flesh as for his soule it was not deriued from the soule of the virgine mary as a part therof but it was made as the soules of all other man be of nothing by the power of god and placed in the bodie both of them from the first moment of their being hauing their subsistance in the person of the son and here vve must take heede of two opinions the first is of the anabaptists which hold that the flesh of christ came downe from heauen and passed through the virgine marie as through a pipe without taking any substance from her the places which they alledge for their purpose are manifestly abused for whereas christ saith of himselfe that he descended from heave his speech must be understood in respect of his godheade which may be saide in some sorte to descend in that it was made manifest in the manhoode here upon earth and vvhereas paul calleth him heavenly amp the lorde from heaven it is not in respect of the substance of his bodie but in respect of the glorious qualities which he received after this resurrection the other opinion is of the papistes that hold the bread in the sacrament to be turned substantially into the bodie of christ which thing if it be true then the bodie of christ is made of bread kneaded and tempered by the hand of the baker and not of the substance of the virgine mary as for the manner of the making and framing of the humane nature of christ it was miraculous not by generation according to the ordinarie course of nature but by an extraordinarie operation of the holy ghost aboue nature and for this cause it is not within the compasse of mans reason either to conceiue or to expresse the manner and order of this conception the angell ascribes two actions to the holy ghost in this matter the one to come upon the virgine marie the other to overshadovv her by the first is signified the extraordinarie worke of the holy ghost in fashioning the humane nature of christ for so much the phrase else where importeth the seconde signifieth that the holy ghost did as it were cast a cloud ouer hir to teach vs that we should not search over much into the mysterie of the incarnation it may be obiected against this which hath beene saide that if christ be in this manner conceiued by the holy ghost then the holy ghost shalbe father to christ and christ his son answer the reason is not good for hee that is a father is not a bare efficient cause but one which in the effecting of any thing conferres the matter vnto it from him selfe whereof it shall be made now the holy ghost did not minister any matter vnto christ from his owne substance but did onely as it were take the masse and lumpe of mans nature from the bodie of the virgine mary and without ordinarie generation made it the bodie of christ as basill saieth christ was conceiued not of the substance but of the power not by any generation but by the appointment and benediction of the holy ghost the second pointe in the conception is the sanctifying of that masse or lumpe which was to be the manhood of christ and that was done upon speciall cause first tha that it might be ioned to the person of the son which coulde not haue beene if it had beene defiled with sinne secondly christ was a saviour as hee is both god and man now then beeing man if hee had beene sinnefull himselfe he could not haue saued others but should haue stood in need of a saviour for himselfe this sanctification hath two partes the first is the stay and stoppage of the propagation of originall sinne and of the guilt of adams sinne which was on this manner god in the beginning set downe this order touching man that what euill or defect soever he brought upon himselfe hee shoulde deriue the same to euerie one of his posteritie begotten of him and hereupon when any father begets his childe hee is in the roome of adam and conveyes unto it besides the nature of man the verie guilt and corruption of nature now for the preuenting of this euill in christ god in great wisdome appointed that hee should be conceiued by the holy ghost without any manner of generation by man and by this meanes he takes substance from the virgine without the guilte and corruption of the substance but it may further be obiected thus all that be in adam haue sinned in him but christ was in adam as hee is man therefore he sinned in him answer the proposition is false vnlesse it be expounded in this manner all that were in adam haue sinned in him so be it they come of him by generation paul saith not that out of one man but by one man sinne entred into the world to shewe that hee propagates his corruption to no more then he begets againe christ is in adam not simply as other man are but in part namely in respect of substance which hee tooke from him and not in respect of the propagation of the substance by ordinarie generation other man are both from adam and by adam but christ is from him alone and not by him as a begetter or procreant cause the second parte of sanctification is the infusion of all purenes and holinesse into the manhood of christ so farre forth as was meete for the nature of a redeemer the duties to be learned hence are these first whereas christ was sanctified in the wombe of the virgine mary we likewise must labour to be sanctified in our selues following the commandement of god be ye holy as i am holy s john saith that he which hath hope to be with christ in glorie in heaven purifieth him selfe even as he is pure no doubt setting before himselfe the exaple of christ as a patterne to follow in all his waies and because our hearts are as it were seas of corruptios we must daily clense our selues of them by litle amp litle following the practise of the poore begger that is alwaies peecing and mending and day by day pulles away some ragges and puts better cloath in the roome and if we shall continually indeauour our selues to cast off the remnants of corruption that hang so fast on and make a supply thereof by some new portions of god heavenly grace we shalbe vessels of honour sanctified amp meete for the lorde and prepared unto euerie good worke christ could not haue bin a fit sauiour for us vnlesse he had first of all bin sanctified neither can we be fit members vnto him unlesse we be purged of our sinnes amp in some measure truly sanctified the comfort which god people may reape of the sanctificatio of christs manhood is great for why was he sanctified surely if we marke it well we shal find it was for the good amp benefit of his elect for ada amp christ be two roots as hath bin shewed adam by creation first received god image and after lost the same for himselfe amp his posteritie now christ to remooue the sinne of man is made the secod adam amp the roote and very head of all the elect his manhoode was filled with holinesse aboue measure that from thence as from a storehouse it might be deriued to all his members and therefore by his most holy conception our sinnefull birth and conception is sanctified and his holinesse serves as a cover to hide our manifold corruptions fro the eyes of god yes it serues as a buckler to awarde the temptations of the deuill for when he shal say to our hearts on this maner no uncleane thing can enter into the kingdome of heauen but thou by reason of the remnants of originall sinne article uncleane therfore thou canst not enter into the kingdome of heauen we returne our answere saying that christs righteousnesse is our righteousnesse seruing to make us stand without blame or spot before god and as iacob put on esaus garments that he might get his fathers blessing so if by faith we doe put on the white garment of righteousnes of our elder brother christ iesus amp present our selues in it unto our heauenly father we shall obtaine his blessing which is eternall happinesse now remaines the third and last part of the conception which is the unio of the godhead amp the manhood concerning which many pointes are particularly to be handled the first is what kind of union this is ans in the trinitie there be two sortes of unions vnion in nature and vnion in person vnion in nature is when two or moe things are ioyned and united into one nature as the father the son the holy ghost being and remaining three distinct persons are one and the same in nature or godhead vnion in person is when things are in that maner vnited that they make but one person or subsistance as a body created by god amp a reasonable soule ioyned both togither make one particular man as peter paul john ampc and this second is the union whereof we intreat in this place by which the second person in trinitie the son of god did vnite unto himselfe the humane nature that is the body and soule of man so as the godhead of the son and the manhoode concurring togither make but one person the second point is in what thing this union doth consist ans it consists in this that the second person the son of god doeth assume unto it a manhod in such order that it being void of all personall being in it selfe doth wholly and onely subsist in the same person as the plante called mi tell having no roote of his owne both growes amp liues in the stock or body of the oke or some other tree so the humane nature hauing no proper subsistance is as it were ingrafted into the person of the son and is wholly supported amp sustained by it so as it should not be at all if it were not sustained in that manner and for the better understanding of this point we must consider that there be foure degrees of the presence of god in his creatures the first is his generall presence and it may be called the presence of his providence whereby he preserueth the substances of all creatures and giueth unto them to liue moove and haue beeing and this extendeth it selfe to all creatures good and bad the second degree is the presence of grace whereby he doeth not onely preserue the substance of his creature but also giueth grace unto it and this agreeth to the church and people of god upon earth the third degree is the presence of glorie peculiar to the saints and angels in heauen and this standes in three things for god not onely preserues their substances and giues them plenty of his grace but also admittes them into his glorious presence so as they may behold his maiestie face to face the fourth and last is that whereby the godhead of the son is present and dwelles with amp in the manhood giuing unto it his owne subsistance wherby it comes to passe that this manhood assumed is proper to the son and cannot be the manhoode of the father or of the holy ghost or of any creature whatsoeuer and this is a thing so admirable and so unspeakeable that among all the workes of god there can not be found another example hereof in all the world hence it followeth necessarily that the manhoode of christ consisting of bodie and reasonable soule is a nature onely and not a person because it doth not subsist alone as other man peter paul john doe but wholly dependes on the person of the worde into the unitie whereof it is receiued the third point is in what order the divine and humane nature of christ are vnited togither answere the common consent of divines is that albeit all the partes of the manhoode and the godhead of christ be united at one instant yet in respect of order hee unites unto himselfe first and immediatly the soule and by the soule the body for it seemes not to be meete that god being a most simple essence should immediatly be ioyned to a compound bodie and therefore he is united unto it by the more simple parte of man which is the soule againe the manhood of christ is first and immediatly ioyned to the person of the son himselfe and by the person to the godhead of the son the fourth point is whether there remaine any difference or diuersitie of the two natures after that the union is made answer the two natures concurring make not the person of the son to be compounded properly but onely by analogie for as bodie and soule make one man so god and man make one christ neither are they turned one into another the godhead into the manhood or the manhoode into the godhead as water was turned into wine at cana in galile nether are they confused and mingled togither as meates in the stomacke but they are and so remaine without composition conversion or confusion really distinct and that in three respectes first in regard of essence for the godhead of christ is the godhead and can not be the manhood and againe the manhood of christ is the manhood and not the godhead secondly they are distinguished in proprieties the godhead is most wise iust mercifull omnipotent yes wisdome iustice mercie and power it selfe and so is not the manhood neither can it be againe christ as hee is god hath his will eternall and uncreated which is all one with the will of the father and the holy ghost and as hee is man he hath another will created in time and placed in his reasonable soule and this christ signifieth when he saith not my will but thy will be done thirdly they are distinct in their actions or operations which though they go together inseparably in the worke of redemption yet they must in no wise be confounded but distinguished as the natures themselues are christ saieth of himselfe i have povver to lay downe my life and i haue power to take it up againe and hereby he shewes the distinction of operations in his two natures for to lay downe his life is an action of the manhoode because the godhead can not die and to take it up againe is the worke of the godhead alone which reunites the soule to the bodie after death the first and last point is what ariseth of this union ans by reason of this hypostaticall union though the godheade receiue nothing from the manhoode yet the manhoode it selfe which is assumed is thereby perfected and enriched with unspeakeable dignitie for first of all it is exalted aboue all creatures whatsoeuer euen angels themselues in that it hath subsistance in the second person in trinitie secondly togither with the godhead of the son it is adored and worshipped with diuine honour as in like case the honour done to the king himselfe redounds to the crowne on his head thirdly by reason of this union the godheade of christ works all things in the matter of our redemptio in amp by the manhood and hereupon the flesh of christ though it profit nothing of it selfe yet by the vertue which it receiueth from that person to which it is ioyned it is quickning flesh and the bread of life againe from this union of two natures into one person ariseth a kind of speech or phrase peculiar to the scriptures called the communication of proprieties when the propertie of one nature is attributed to the whole person or to the other nature as when paul saith that god shed his blood that the lord of glorie was crucified and when christ saith that he talking with nichodemus was then in heauen the use of the personall union is threefold first it serues to shew the heinousnesse of our sinnes and the greatnesse of our miserie for it had not bene possible to make a satisfaction to god iustice in mans nature for the least offence vnlesse the same nature had first of all bene neerely ioyned to the godhead of the son that thereby it might be so far forth supported and sustained that it might ouercome the wrath of god secondly it sets forth unto us the endles loue of god to man for whereas by reason of adams fall wee are become the vilest of all creatures except the deuill and his angels yet by his mysticall coniunction our nature is is exalted to such an estate and condition as is farre aboue all creatures euen the angels themselues thirdly it is as it were the keye of all our comfort for all sound comfort standes in happinesse all happinesse is in fellowship with god all fellowshippe with god is by christ who for this cause beeing verie god became verie man that he might reconcile man to god and god to man thus much of the conception of christ now followes his birth whereby in the ordinarie time of trauell according to the course of nature hee was brought forth into the world by the virgin mary and it was the will of god that christ should not onely be conceiued but also borne and that after the maner of man that hee might be knowen to be verie man indeede in the birth we may consider foure things the time the place the manner the manifestation of it the time was in the last daies toward the end of the weeks of daniel which are to be accouted from the end of the captivitie of babylo amp make in all yeres or more plainely yeeres and more from the beginning of the world and as paul saith in the fulnesse of time and the euangelists haue noted of purpose the time to haue bene when augustus caesar taxed the iewes and all nation under his dominions to signifie that christ was borne at the verie time foretold by iacob when the crowne and scepter was taken from iuda and withall to shevve that his kingdome was not of this world and it vvas the good pleasure of god that christ should not be borne either later or sooner but so many ages from the beginning of the worlde and this consideration of the verie time it selfe serues greatly for the confirmation of our faith for thus may vve reason vvith our selues if god vvho in the beginning made a promise to our first parents concerning the seede of the woman deferred it almost yeres and yet at length accomplished the same to the verie full then no doubt god hauing promised the resurrection of the dead and life everlasting will in his good time bring them to passe though as yet wee see them not and thus by the accoplishment of al things past should we confirme our hope concerning things to come the place vvas not hierusalem nor nazareth nor any other citie but onely a village of iuda called bethleem that the prophesie of micheas might be fulfilled thou bethleem ephrata article little to be among the thousandes of iuda yet out of thee shall he come forth vnto me that shall be the ruler in israell and here vve may obserue a memorable example of god prouidence vvhich ouer ruleth the procedings of cruell tirants to the accomplishing of his owne will they themselues for their parts intending nothing lesse augustus not so much as dreaming of the birth of the messias gaue commandement that euery man shoulde goe to his owne city to be taxed and hereupon ioseph and mary take their iourny from nazareth to bethleem which iourney god himselfe appointed and disposed to this end that the messias might be borne in the place which he preordained and foretold by his prophet the manner of christs birth was verie base and poore for the place where hee was borne was a stable and the cradle where he lay was a cratch and he willingly tooke upon him this povertie for sundry causes i that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith that he should be the shame and contempt of the people and that ye shall grow vp as a roote out of a drie ground and have neither fourme nor beauty ii that hee might afterward from this base condition be exalted euen in his manhood to that rich and glorious estate in which he should manifest himselfe to be lord of heauen and earth iii he was borne in exceeding pouertie that he might shame the wise man of this worlde who exceedingly esteeme of their riches power and glorie perswading themselues that without such meanes no good thing can be done and yet for all this they can not so much as reconcile one man to god by all their might and wealth whereas christ himselfe hath done the same both in povertie and weakenesse and can enlarge and preserue his kingdome without earthly helpes when he hung upon the crosse the soldiers stript him of his garments and beeing naked he brought that to passe which all the monarches of the earth in all their roialties could neuer haue perfourmed and whether christ lie in the manger betweene the oxe and the asse or in the pallace of the king it matters not in regard of our saluation iiii he came in this maner that there might be a difference betweene his first comming in the flesh and his last comming to iudgement in the first he came onely for this end not to make any outward alterations in the worlde but to change the conscience and to put in execution the worke of our spirituall redemption and therfore he hath reserued the ouerturning of all earthly estates with the manifestation of his owne glorie to the latter v lastly hee was borne in a poore estate that hee might procure true riches for vs in heauen and withall sanctifie vnto us our pouertie upon earth as paul saith ye know the grace of our lord iesus christ that he being rich for your sakes became poore that ye through his povertie might be made rich hee was content to lie in the manger that wee might rest in heauen this serues to teach us to be content to beare any mean condition that the lorde shall sende upon vs for this is the verie estate of the son of god him selfe and if for our cause he did not refuse the basest condition that euer was why should we murmure at the same for what is the best of vs but miserable sinners and therefore utterly unworthy either to goe or lie upon the bare earth and though wee fare and lie better then our lorde himselfe yet such is our daintinesse we are not pleased therewith whereas hee for his part disdained not the manger of the oxe and if the lord of heauen and earth comming into the worlde finde so little entertainment or fauour we for our parts being his members should willingly prepare our selues to take as hard measure at the hands of man the last point is the manifestation of christes birth that it might be knowen to the worlde where consider two circumstances the first to whome namely to poore shepheards tending their flockes by night and not to great or mightie man louers of this worlde nor to the priests of ierusalem contemners of god grace and that for two causes one because the shepheards were the fittest persons to publish the same at bethleem the other it was god pleasure to manifest that in the birth of christ which paul saith not many wise man after the flesh not many mightie not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise the second is by whome by the angell of the lorde appearing in great glorie unto the shepheardes for the priests of ierusalem and the rulers of the synagogues to whome this office did belong helde their peace beeing blinded in their manifolde errours and wicked waies the duties to be learned of the birth of christ are these first wee are admonished hereby to magnifie and praise the name of god saying with mary my soule doth magnifie the lord and my spirite reioyceth in god my saviour and with zachary blessed be the lorde god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and with the angell of the lord glory to god in the highest heavens for in this birth is made manifest the wisedome the truth the iustice and mercie and goodnes of god towards us more then euer it was before yes as christ god and man is more excellent then the first adam created according to god own image and as the spirituall life is better then the naturall life and as the eternall and most holy mariage of christ the husband and his spouse the church rising as it were out of the bloode that trickled out of his side is more wonderfull then the creation of eue of the rib of adam lastly as it is a far greater matter by death to overcome death and to turne it into eternall life then to command that to exist and be which was not before so is the worke of redemption begun in the birth of christ more unspeakeable and admirable then the first creation of man hereupon not cherubims as in the vision of isaiah not elders as in the apocalyps but a great multitude of angels like armies were heard to praise god at the birth of christ and no doubt the like sight was not seene since the beginning of the world and the angels by their example put vs in minde to consider aright of this benefite and to praise god for it but alas this practise is verie rare in this fruitlesse and barren age of the worlde where sinne and iniquitie abounds as may be seene by experience for by an old custom we reteine still in the church the feast of the nativity of christ so commonly called which neuerthelesse is not spent in praising the name of god that he hath sent his son from his owne bosome to be our redeemer but contrariwise in rifling dicing carding masking mumming amp in all licentious libertie for the most part as though it were some heathen feast of ceres or bacchus secondly christ was conceiued and borne in bodily maner that there might be a spirituall conception and birth of him in our hearts as paul saith my litle children of whome i travell till christ be formed in you and that is when we are made new creatures by christ and performe obedience to our creatour when the people said to christ that his mother and his brother sought him he answered he that doth the will of god is my brother my sister and mother therefore let us go with the shepheards to bethleem and finding our blessed sauiour swadled and lying in the cratch let us bring him thence and make our owne heartes to be his cradle that we may he able to say that we liue not but christ liues in vs and let vs present unto him ourselues our body and soules as the best gold myrrhe and frankincense that may be and thus conceiuing him by faith he remaining without change we shalbe changed into him and made bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh the world i know neuer so much as dreameth of this kind of conception and birth for as dauid saith man travell with wickednesse conceive mischiefe amp bring forth a lye and s iames saith man are drawn away by their owne concupiscense which when it hath conceived bringeth forth sinne and these are the ougly and monstrous birthes of these daies but let us i pray you contrariwise waile and mourne for the barrennesse of our heartes that doe so little conceiue the grace of christ in heart and bring it foorth in action the mother of christ vndoubtedly was a blessed woman but if shee had not as well conceiued christ in her heart as shee did in her womb shee had not beene saved and no more can wee unlesse we doe the same the birth of christ to them that haue touched hearts is the comfort of comforts and the sweetest balme or confection that euer was behold say the angel to the shepheards we bring tidirgs of great ioy that shalbe to all people but wherein stands the ioy they adde further vnto you this day is borne in the citie of dauid a sauiour which is christ the lord and no maruaile for in that birth is manifested the good will of god to man and by it wee haue peace first with god secondly with our selues in coscience thirdly with the good angels of god fourthly with our enemy lastly with all the creatures for this cause the angels sang peace on earth good will towards man in the last place the creede notes unto us the parent or mother of christ the virgine mary and here at the verie first it may be demanded how he could haue either father or mother because he was figured by melchisedech who had neither father nor mother ans melchisedech is said to be without father amp mother not because he had none at all for according to the ancient and receiued opinion it is verie likely that he was sem the son of noe but because where he is mencioned under this name of melchisedech in the chapter of genes there is no mention made either of father or mother and so christ in some sort is without father or mother as he is man he hath no father as he is god he hath no mother and whereas christ is called the son of ioseph it was not because he was begotte of him but because ioseph was his reputed father or which is more because hee was a legall father namely according to the iewes laws in that as sundry divines think he was the next of his kin and therfore to succeed him as his lawful heire mary became the mother of christ by a kind of calling thereto which was by an extraordinarie message of an angell concerning the conception and birth of christ in and by her to which calling and message shee condiscended saying behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and hereupon shee conceiued by the holy ghost this being so it is more then sensles folly to turne the salutatio of the angel haile freely beloved ampc into a praier and she must be held to be the mother of whole christ god and man and therefore the ancient church hath called the mother of god yet not the mother of the godhead furthermore the mother of christ is described by her qualitie a virgine and by her name mary shee was a virgine first that christ might bee conceiued without sinne and be a perfect sauiour secondly that the saying of the prophet esai might be fulfilled behold a virgin shal coceiue amp beare a son according as it was foretold by god in the first giuing of the promise the seed of the woman not the seed of the man shall bruise the serpents head now the iewes to elude the most pregnant testimonie of the prophet say that alma signifieth not a virgin but a young woma which hath knowne a man but this is indeede a forgerie for esay there speakes of an extraordinarie worke of god aboue nature whereas for a woman hauing knowne man to conceiue is no wonder and the worde alma through the whole bible is taken for a virgin as by a particular search will appeare as marie conceiued a virgin so it may be well thought that shee continued a virgin to the end though we make it no article of our faith when christ was vpon the crosse he commended his mother to the custodie of john which probablie argueth that shee had no child to whose care and keeping shee might be commended and though christ be called hi first borne yet doth it not follow that shee had any child after him for as that is called last after which there is none so that is called the first before which there was none and as for ioseph when he was espoused to marie he was a man of eightie yeares old and here we haue occasion to praise the wisdome of god in the forming of man the first man adam was borne of no man but immediatly created of god the second that is eue is formed not of a woman but of a man alone the third and all after begotten both of woman and man the fourth that is christ god and man not of no man as adam not of no woman as eue not of man and woman as we but after a new manner of a woman without a man he is conceiued and borne and hereupon our dutie is not to despise but highly to reuerence the virgin marie as beeing the mother of the son of god a prophetisse vpon earth a saint in heauen and we doe willingly condiscend to giue hir honour three waies by thanksgiuing to god for hir by a reuerent estimation of her by imitation of hir excellent vertues yet farre be it fro vs to adore hir with diuine honour by praier to call vpon hir as though she knew our hearts and heard our requests and to place hir in heauen as a queene aboue the son of god the name of the mother of christ is added to shew that he came of the linage of dauid and that therefore he was the true messias before spoken of it may be obiected that both matthew and luke set downe the genealogie of ioseph of whome christ was not answer matthew sets down indeed in christs genealogie the naturall descent of ioseph the husband of marie hauing iacob for his naturall father but luke taking an other course propounds the naturall descent of marie the mother of christ and when he saith that ioseph was the son of eli he meanes of a legall son for sonnes and daughters in lawe are called sonnes and daughters to their fathers and mothers in law marie her selfe and not ioseph beeing the naturall daughter of eli and whereas luke doth not plainely say that marie was the daughter of eli but puts ioseph the son in law in hir roome the reason hereof may be because it was the manner of the iewes to account and continue their genealogies in the male and not in the female sexe the man beeing the head of the familie and not the woman and though ruth and rahab and other woman be mentioned by matthew yet that is onely by the way for they make no degrees herein againe it may further be demaunded how christ could comes of dauid by salomon as mathew saith and by nathan as luks saith they twaine being two distinct sonnes of dauid answer by vertue of the law whereby the brother was bound to raise vp seede to his brother there was a double discent in vse among the iewes the one was naturall the other legall natural when one man discended of an other by generation as the child from the naturall father legall when a man not begotten of an other yet did succeede him in his inheritance amp thus salathiel is the naturall son of neri and the legall son of iechonias now saint luke sets downe the naturall descent of christ from dauid by nathan and saint matthew the other descent which is legall by salomon whome christ succeeded in the right of the kingdom being borne the king of the iewes none that could possibly be named hauing more right to it then he by this discent of christ we haue occasion to consider that christ was euen in his birth the most excellent and noble man that euer was descending of the eternall father as he is the son of god and as he man descending of the patriarks and of the renowmed kings of iudah and this his nobilitie he conuaies in part to his members in that he makes them the sonnes of god a royall priesthood and a peculiar people to himselfe inriching them also with the reuenewes of the whole world and with the title and right to the kingdome of glorie in heauen as their inheritance and withall christ beeing the liuely patterne of true nobilitie by his example man of blood are taught not to stand so much on their pedigree and their ancetours as though nobilitie stood in this that man descends of man but to labour with all that they may to be the sonnes and daughters of god by regeneratio in christ this in deede is the ornament of the blood the best part in the noble mans skutchin and the finest flowre in his garland and though a man be neuer so noble or great an estate yet if he be not a repentant sinner he is base and vile and his nobilitie stinks in the nostrils of god christ in his genealogie doth not so much as vouchsafe to name those his ancetours that ruled wickedly and hereupon saint matthew omitteth three kings of iuda achaziah ioas amp amaziah whereas neuerthelesse hainous offendours that repented are mentioned as ruth and thamat and bathshabe thus much of the incarnation of christ now followeth the third and last point which is to be considered in the description of christ namely the estate of christ after his birth which is two fold the estate of humiliation and the estate of exaltation the estate of humiliation is the condition of christ the mediatour in which he abased himselfe euen to the death of the crosse that by that meanes he might performe the office of a priest in making satisfaction to the iustice of his father this estate agrees to the whole person of christ according to both natures for first of all his manhoode was abased and humbled in that it was made subiect to the infirmities of mans nature as also to the miseries and punishments which were due vnto man for sinne secondly his godhead was abased not as it is considered in it selfe for so it admits no alteration or chaunge but in respect of the flesh or manhoode assumed vnder the which as vnder a vaile the godhead lay hid from the first moment of the incarnation to the time of his resurrectio without any great manifestation of his power and maiestie therein the order of these two estates must be marked first is the estate of humiliation and then in the second place followes the estate of exaltation as christ saith of him selfe o fooles and slow of heart to beleeue ampc ought not christ to haue suffered these things and to enter into his glorie and here we for our part must learne a lesson the same which was true in christ the head must be verifyed in all his members they must also haue their two fold estate first in this life the estate of humiliation secondly after this life the estate of glorie and as christ first entred into the state of his humiliation and then into glorie so it is with his members first they must be abased in this life and secondly exalted in the worlde to come he that will raigne with christ and be exalted must first suffer with him and be humbled hee that will weare the crowne of glorie must weare first a crowne of thornes they that will haue all teares wyped from their eyes must here first in this life shed them and the children of god before they can sing the song of moses and of the servant of god and of the lambe must first swimme through the sea of burning glasse wherby it is signified that those which after this life would sing songs of praises to christ must in this life be cast into a sea of miserie and if this be true then we may heare learne that it is a wretched case for a man in this life to haue perpetuall ease rest and quietnes both in bodie and soule goods and good name for we see by christs example that through aduersitie we must come to happines and if a man would haue rest and peace in the life to come then in this life he must suffer trouble persecution and sorrow indeede in the iudgement of the world they are blessed that alwaies liue at rest but before god they are most miserable and as oxen which are made fat in the best pasture readie for the slaughterhouse euery day secondly here is an excellent consolation for those which professe the gospell of christ in the time of trouble and persecution they must reioyce because the state of humiliation in this life is a signe that they are in the plaine and right way to saluation and glorie a man is to take his iourney into a farre countrey and inquiring for the way it is told him that there are many plaine waies but the straight and right way is full of woods and hills and mountaines and great daungers now when he is traueiling and comes into those places he gathereth certenly that he is in the right way so the child of god that is going to the kingdome of heauen though there be many waies to walke in yet he knowes that there is but one right way which is very straight and narrow full of trouble sorrow and persecution full of all manner of crosses and afflictions and when in this life he is persecuted and afflicted for good causes whether in bodie or in minde if he be content to beare his crosse it agreeth plainly that he is in the right way vnto saluation for thorough many afflictions wee must enter into the kin dome of heauen the humiliation of christ is first of all set downe in the creede generally and secondly by his parts or degrees generally in these words suffered vnder pontius pilate where we must consider two things the passion it selfe and vnder whome it was for the first that we may the better conceiue the passion in his owne nature seuen speciall points must be opened i the cause efficient the principall cause of the passion as it is the price of our redemption was the decree and prouidence of god as peter saith expressely that christ was deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of god the impulsive cause that mooued god to worke saluation by this meanes was nothing in man for all mankinde was shut vp vnder vnbeleefe and therefore vnable to procure the least fauour at god had but the will and good pleasure of god within himselfe the instruments which the lord vsed in this busines were the wicked iewes and gentiles amp the deuill himselfe by who he brought to passe the most admirable worke of redemption euen then when they according to their kind did nothing els but practise wickednes and malice against christ ii the matter of the passion is the whole malediction or curse of the law containing in it all manner of aduersities and miseries both of bodie and minde all which may be reduced to three heads the temptations of christ his ignominies and slaunders his manifold sorrows and griefes especially those which stande in the apprehension of the vnsupportable wrath of god iii the forme of the passion is that excellent and meritorious satisfaction which in suffering christ made vnto his father for mans sinne we doe not rightly consider of the passion if we conceiue it to be a bare and naked suffering of punishment but withall wee must conceiue it as a propitiation or a meanes satisfactorie to god iustice the passion considered as a passion ministers no comfort but all our ioy and reioycing stands in this that by faith we apprehend it as it is a satisfaction or a meanes of reconciliation for our offences in this very point stands the dignitie of the passion whereby it differs from all other sufferings of man whatsoeuer therefore most damnable and wicked is the opinion of the papists who besides the alone passion of christ maintaine workes of satisfaction partly of their owne and partly of the saints departed which they adde to the passion as an appendance thereof iv the ende of the passion is that god might bring to passe a worke in which hee might more fully manifest his iustice and mercie then he did in the creation and that is the reconciliation betweene god and man and here remember with the passion to ioyne the obedience of christ in fulfilling the lawe for christ in suffering obeyed and in obeying suffered and they must be ioyntly conceiued together for this cause in reconciliation with god two things are required the remoouing of sinne in regard of the guilt of the fault and the punishment and the conferring or giuing of righteousnes now the passion of christ considered apart from his legall obedience onely takes away the guilt and punishment frees man from death and makes him of a sinner to be no sinner and that he may be fully reconciled to god and accepted as righteous to life euerlasting the legall obedience of christ must be imputed and therefore in the scriptures where all obedience is ascribed to the death and passion of christ this very obedience which stands in the perfect loue of god and man must be included and not excluded v the time of the passion was from the very byrth of christ to his resurrection yet so as the beginnings onely of his sufferings were in the course of his life and the accomplishment thereof to the very full vpon the crosse vi the person that suffered was the son of god himselfe concerning whome in this case two questions must be resolued the first how it can stand with god iustice to lay punishment vpon the most righteous man that euer was and that for grieuous sinners considering that tyrants themselues will not doe so answer in the passion christ must not be considered as a priuate person for then it could not stande with equitie that he should be plagued and punished for our offences but as one in the eternall counsell of god set apart to be a publike suretie or pledge for vs to suffer and performe those things which we in our owne persons should haue suffered and performed for this cause god the father is said to giue his son vnto vs and the son again to giue his life for his friends the second question is how by the short amp temporary death of the son of god any man can possibly be freed from eternal death amp damnation which is due vnto him for the least sinne answer when wee say that the son of god suffered it must be vnderstood with distinction of the natures of christ not in respect of the godhead but in respect of the assumed manhood yet neuerthelesse the passion is to be ascribed to the whole person of christ god and man and from the dignitie of the person which suffered ariseth the dignitie and excellencie of the passion whereby it is made in value and price to couteruaile euerlasting damnation for when as the son of god suffered the curse for a short time it is more then if all man and angels had suffered the same for euer vii the difference of the passion of christ and the sufferings of martyrs and that stands in two things first christs passion was a curse or punishment the sufferings of the martyrs are no curses but either chastisments or trials secondly the passion of christ is meritorious for vs euen before god because he became our mediatour and suretie in the couenant of grace but the sufferings of martyrs or not of value to merit for vs at god hand because in suffering they were but priuate man and therefore they nothing appertaine to vs by this it appeares that the treasurie of the church of rome which is as it were a common chest containing the ouerplus of the merits of saints mingled with the merits of christ kept and disposed by the pope himselfe is nothing else but a sensles dotage of mans braine and whereas they say that christ by his death did merit that saints might merit both for themselues and others it is as much as if they should say the son of god became iesus to make euery one of vs iesus and it is a manifest vntruth which they say for the very manhood of christ considered apart from the godhead cannot merit properly considering whatsoeuer it is hath or doth it is hath and doth the same wholly and onely by grace whereas therefore christ meriteth for vs it is by reason he is both god and man in one person for this cause it is not possible that one meere man should merit for an other the vse of the passion followeth it is the manner of friers and iesuits in the church of rome to vse the consideration of the passion of christ as a meanes to stirre vp compassion in themselues partly towards christ who suffered grieuous torments and partly towards the virgin marie who for the torments of her deere son was exceedingly troubled and withall to kindle in their hearts an indignation towards the iewes that put christ to death but indeede this kinde of vse is meere humane and may in like manner be made by reading of any humane historie but the proper and the speciall vse of the passion in deede is this first of all we must set it before our eyes as a looking glasse in which we may cleerely behold the horriblenes of our sinnes that could not be pardoned without the passion of the son of god and the vnspeakeable loue of christ that dyed for vs and therefore loued his owne enemy more then his owne selfe and lastly our endles peace with god and happines in that considering the person of our redeemer who suffered the pangs of hell we may after a sort finde our paradise euen in the middest of hell secondly the meditation of christs passion serues as a most worthie meanes to beginne and to confirme grace specially when it is mingled with faith and that t o waies for first it serues to breede in our hearts a godly sorrowe for our sinnes past when we doe seriously with our selues consider that our owne sinnes were the cause of all the paines and sorrowes and calamities which he suffered in life and death when any man had sinned vnder the law he brought vnto the temple or tabernacle some kinde of beast for an offer according as he was prescribed laying his hande vpon the heade of it and afterward slaying it before the lord now by the ceremonie of laying on the hand he testified that he for his part had deserued death and not the beast and that it beeing slaine and sacrificed was a signe vnto him of the sacrifice of christ offered vpon the crosse for his sinnes and hereby we are taught that so oft as we remember the passion of christ we should lay our hands as it were vpon our owne heads vtterly accusing and condemning ourselues euermore keeping this in heart that christ suffered not for himselfe but for our offences which were the proper cause of all his woe and miserie and as christs passion was grieuous and bitter vnto him so should our sinnes likewise be grieuous and bitter vnto vs let vs alwaies remember this otherwise we shall neuer reape any sound benefit by the passion of christ againe the passion of christ is a notable meanes to stirre vp in our hearts a purpose and a care to reforme our selues and liue in holines and newnes of life on this manner hath the son of god so mercifully dealt with me as to suffer the curse of the whole law for my manifold iniquities and to deliuer me from iust and deserued damnation yes no doubt he hath i am resolued of it if i should goe on in mine old course i should be the most vngratefull of all creatures to this my louing sauiour i will therefore by his grace returne and reforme my life and in this very point of reformation the passion of christ is set before vs as a most liuely patterne and example to follow for as much saith saint peter as christ hath suffered for vs in the flesh arme your selues likewise with the same minde which is that hee which hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sinne where hee teacheth that there must be in vs a spirituall passion answearable to the passion of christ for as his enemy did lade him with miseries euen to the death of the crosse so should we lade our owne flesh that is the corruption of our natures with all such meanes as may subdue and weaken crucifie and kill it to the doing of this three things especially are required first we must consider that the corruption of our rebellious natures is like the great and mightie goliath and the grace of god which we haue receiued like young and little dauid and therefore if wee desire that grace should preuaile against corruption we must disarme the strong man and strippe him of all his weapons which is done by giuing all the members of our body to be instruments of the seruice of god in righteousnes and holines secondly we must indeauour to keepe in the corruption of nature as it were choking and smothering at the heart that by it neither the worlde nor the deuill preuaile against vs and this must be done by hauing a narrow regard vnto all the powers and faculties of bodie and soule setting a watch before our eyes eares lippes and all other parts of the bodie that are in any action the instruments of the soule and aboue all as salomon saith by countergarding the heart with all diligence by the outward senses of the bodie as through open windows the deuill creepes into the heart and therefore our duetie is to stoppe all such waies of entrance thirdly when originall corruption begins to rebell either in the minde will or any of the affections then must we draw out the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and incounter with that hidious gyant laying load vpo him by the iudgements and threatnings of the law amp as it were beating him down with clubbes as paul speaketh and if it fall out that concupiscence beginne to conceiue and bring foorth any sinne we must cruise it in the head amp dash it against the ground as a bird in the shell least it growe vp to our vtter confusion these are the dueties which wee should learne by the passion of christ but lamentable are our daies in which all for the most part goes contrarie for commonly man are so farre from killing and subduing the rebellion of the naturall concupiscence that all their studie and care is howe they may feeede and cherish it and make it stronger then the mightie goliah but let vs for our parts be conformable to christ in his passion suffering in our flesh as he suffered in bodie and soule for vs and let vs daily more and more by the hand of faith apprehend and applie to our hearts and consciences the passion of christ that it may as a fretting corasive eate out the poyson of our sinnefull natures and to consume it now followeth the second point concerning the passion of christ which is vnder whome he suffered namely vnder pontius pilate and christ may be said to suffer vnder him in two respects first because he was then the president of iurie for a little before the birth of christ the kingdome of the iewes was taken away by the romane emperour and reduced into a province amp pontius pilate was placed ouer the iewes not as king but as the romane emperours deputy and this circustance is noted in the historie of the gospell amp here specified in the creede to shew that the messias was exhibited in the time foretold by the prophets iacob foretold that shilo must be borne after the scepter is removed from iuda isaiah saith that the familie of ishai shall be worne as it were to the root before christ as a branch shall spring out of it againe christ suffered vnder pontius pilate as he was a iudge whereby we are giuen to vnderstand of a woonder namely that christ the son of god king of heauen and earth was arraigned at the barre of an earthly iudge amp there condened for thus much the words in meaning import that pontius pilate sate as iudge on christ to examine him to arraigne him and giue sentence against him wherefore before we come to speake of the degrees of the passion of christ we must needes intreat of his arraignement vpon earth in handling whereof wee must generally consider these points first that when hee was arraigned before pilate he was not as a priuate man but as a pledge and suretie that stood in the place and steade of vs miserable sinners as the prophet jsaiah saith he bare our infirmities and carried our sorrowes and withall in him was mankinde arraigned before god secondly this arraignment was made not priuately in a corner but openly in the publique court and that in a great feast of the iewes as it were in the hearing of the whole worlde thirdly though pilate in citing examinig and condemning christ intended not to worke any part of mans redemption yet was this wholly set downe in the counsell amp good pleasure of god in whose roome pilate sate and whose iudgement he exercised the generall vse of christs arraignement is two fold first it is a terrour to all impenitent sinners for there is no freedome or protection from the iudgement of god but by the arraignment of christ and therefore such as in this life receiue him not by faith must at the ende of this worlde be brought out to the most terrible barre of he last iudgement there to be arraigned before the king of heauen and earth and marke the equitie hereof christ himselfe could not haue beene our sauiour and redeemer vnlesse he had beene brought out to the barre of an earthly iudge and arraigned as a guiltie malefactour and therefore there is no man vpon earth that liues and dies out of christ but hee must whether hee will or no holde vp his hande at the barre of the great iudge of all mankinde where he shall see hell vnderneath him burning red hotte and opening it selfe wide to swallow him vp and on the right hand of god standing all the prophets apostles and saints of god giuing iudgement against him on the left hand the deuill and all his angels accusing him and within him a guiltie conscience condemning him and thus shall be one day the arraignment of all those persons that with full purpose of heart cleaue not to christ and yet alas huge and infinite is the number of those which make more account of transitorie and earthly matters euen of their pigges with the gaderens then of him and his benefits but such should rather be pitied then despised of vs considering their estate is such that euery day they are going as traytours pinnioned to their owne iudgement that they may goe thence to eternall exequution secondly christs arraignment is a comfort to the godly for he was arraigned before pilate that all such as truly beleeue in him might not be arraigned before god at the day of the last iudgement he was accused before an earthly iudge that they might be cleared and excused before the heauenly iudge lastly he was here condemned on earth that we might receiue the sentence of absolution and be eternally saued in heauen the arraignment of christ hath three parts his apprehension his accusation his condemnation in the apprehension wee must consider two things the dealing of christ and the dealing of iudas and the iewes the dealing and proceeding of christ was this when he saw that the time of his apprehension and death was neere he solemnly prepared himselfe thereto and his example must teach euery one of vs who knowe not the shortnes of our daies euery houre to prepare our selues against the day of death that the we may be found readie of the lord what shall the son of god himselfe make preparation to his owne death and shall not we most miserable sinners doe the same who stande in neede of a thousand preparations more then he wherefore let vs continually thinke with our selues that euery present day is the last day of our life that so we may addresse our selues to death againe the next day the first thing which christ doth in this preparation is to make choice of the place in which he was to be apprehended as will appeare by conferring the evangelists together s matthew saith he went to the place called gethsemane s luke saith he went to the mount of oliues as he was accustomed and that wee might not imagine that christ did this that he might escape and hide himselfe from the iewes s john saith that iudas which betraied him knewe the place because oftentimes he resorted thither with his disciples whereas if he had feared apprehension he would haue rather gone aside to some other secret and vnwonted place this the is the first point to be cosidered that christ knowing the time of his owne death to be at hand doth willingly of his owne accord resort to such a place in which his enemy in all likelihood might easily finde him and haue fit opportunitie to attach him for if he should haue still remained in ierusalem the scribes amp pharisies durst not haue enterprized his apprehension because of the people whome they feared but out of the citie in the garden all occasion of feare is cut off by this it is manifest that christ yeilded himselfe to death willingly and not of constraint and vnlesse his sufferings had bin voluntarie on his part they could neuer haue bin a satisfaction to god iustice for our sinnes here a question offereth it selfe to be considered whether a man may lawfully flie in daunger and persequution seeing christ him selfe doth not answer when good means of flying and iust occasion is offered it is lawful to flie when the iewes sought to kill paul at damascus the disciples tooke him by night and put him through the wall and let him downe in a basket to escape their handes when moses was called by god to deliuer the israelites after he had slaine the egyptian and the fact was knowne and pharao sought to kill him for it he fled to the land of madian and our sauiour christ sundrie times when he was to be stoned and otherwaies hurt by the iewes withdrewe himselfe from among them it is lawful then to flie in persequution these caueats obserued first if a man finde not himselfe sufficiently strengthened to beare the crosse secondly his departure must be agreeable to the generall calling of a christian seruing to the glorie of god and the good of his brother and the hurt of none thirdly there must be freedome at the least for a time from the bond of a mans particular calling if he be a magistrate he must be freed from ruling if a minister from preaching and teaching otherwaies he may not flie and in this respect christ who did withdraw himselfe at other times would not flie at this time because the houre of his suffering was come wherein hee intended most willingly to submit himselfe to the good pleasure and will of his father the second part of the preparation is the praier which christ made vnto his father in the garden and herein his exaple doth teach vs earnestly to pray vnto god against the daunger of imminent death and the temptations which are to come and if christ who was without sinne and had the spirite aboue measure had neede to pray then much more haue we neede to be watchfull in all kinde of prayers who are laden with the burden of sinne and compassed about with manifolde impediments and daungerous enemy in this praier sundrie points worthie our marking are to be considered the first who prayed ans christ the son of god but stil we must remember the distinction of natures and of their operations in one and the same christ he prayeth not in his godhead but according to his manhood the second is for whome he prayeth ans some haue thought that this amp all other his praiers were made for his mystical body the church but the truth is he now praies for himself yet not as he was god for the godheade feeles no want but as he was a man abased to the forme of a servant amp that for two causes first in that he was a man hee was a creature and in that respect was to performe homage to god the creatour secondly as he was man he put on the infirmities of our nature and thereupon praied that hee might haue strength and power in his manhood to support him in bearing the whole brunt of the passion to come the third point is to whome he prayed answer to the father neither must this trouble vs as though christ in praying to the father should pray to himselfe because he is one and the same god with him for though in essence they admit no distinction yet in person o in the proper manner of subsisting they doe the father is one person the son an other therefore as the father saying from heauen this is my welbeloued son spake not to himselfe but to the son so againe the son when he praieth he praies not to himselfe but to the father the fourth point what was the particular cause of his prayer answer his agonie in which his soule was heauie vnto death not because he feared bodily death but because the malediction of the law euen the very heat of the furie amp indignation of god was powred forth vpon him wherewith he was affected and troubled as if he had bin defiled with the sinnes of the whole world and this appeares by the words whereby the evangelists expresse the agonie of christ which signifie exceeding great sorrow and griefe by his dolefull complaint to his disciples in the garden my soule is heauie vnto the death by his feruent prayer thrise repeated full of dolefull passions by the comming of an angel to comfort him by his bloodie sweate the like whereof was neuer heard and herein lies the difference betweene christs agonie amp the death of martyrs he put on the guilt of al our sinnes they in death are freed fro the same he was left to himselfe void of comfort they in the midst of their afflictions feele the vnspeakeable comfort of the holy ghost amp therfore we need not meruaile why christ should pray against death which neuerthelesse his members haue receiued amp borne most ioyfully againe this most bitter agonie of christ is the ground of all our reioycing and the cause why paul biddes all the faithfull in the person of the philippians to reioyce alwaies in the lord amp againe to reioyce and here we are further taught that when we are pluged into a sea of most grieuous afflictions amp ouerwhelmed with the gulfes of most dreadfull temptations euen then then i say we shoulde not be discouraged but lift vp our hearts by fervent prayer to god thus did christ when in the garden he was drink the cuppe of the wrath of god and sucking up the verie dregges of it and david saith that out of the deepes he called of the name of the lorde and was heard the fifth point what is the matter and forme of this prayer ansvver christ praies to be delivered from the death and passion which was to come saying on this maner father let this cuppe passe from me yet with two clauses added thereto if it be possible and not my will but thy will be done but it may be demaunded how it could be that christ knowing that it was his fathers will and counsell that he should suffer death for man and also comming into the world for that end should make such a request to his father without sinne answer the request proceedes only of a weakenesse or infirmitie in christes manhood without sinne which appeareth thus wee must still consider that when hee made this praier to his father the whole wrath of god and the verie dolours and pangs of hell seased upon him whereby the senses and powers of his mind were astonished and wholly bent to relieue nature in this agonie for as when the heart is smitten with griefe all the blood in the bodie flowes unto it to comfort it so when christ was in this astonishment the understanding and memorie and all the parts of his humane nature as it were for a time suspending their owne proper actions concurred to sustaine and support the spirit and life of christ as much as possibly might be nowe christ being in the middest of this perplexed estate praieth on this manner father if it be possible let this cuppe passe and these words proceede not from any sinne or disobedience to his fathers will but only from a meere perturbation of mind caused onely by an outward meanes namely the apprehension of god anger which neither blinded his understanding nor tooke away his memorie so as he forgot his fathers will but only stopped and staied the acte of reasoning and remembring for a little time even as in the most perfect clocke that is the motion may be staied by the aire or by a mans hand or by some outward cause without any defect or breach made in any part of it it may be obiected that christes will is flat contrarie to the will of his father answere christes will as he is man and the will of the father in this agonie were not contrarie but onely diverse and that without any contradiction or contrarietie now a man may will a diverse thing from that which god willeth and that without sinne paul desired to preach the worde of god in asia and bithynia but hee was hindred by the spirite for all this there is no contrarietie betweene paul and the spirite of god but in the shewe of discorde great consent for that which paul willeth well the spirite of god willeth not by a better will though the reason hereof be secret and the reason of pauls will manifest againe the minister in charitie reputing the whole congregation to be elect in holy maner seeketh and willeth the saluation of euerie one which neuerthelesse the lorde in his eternall counsell willeth not nowe betweene both these willes there may be and is a difference without contrarietie for one good thing as it is good may differ from another but it can not be contrarie to it it may further be alleadged that in this prayer there seemes to be a combat and fight in the minde will and affections of christ and therefore sinne ansvvere there are three kinde of combates the one betweene reason and appetite and this fight is alwaies sinnefull and was not in christ the second is betweene the flesh and the spirite and this may be in god childe who is but in part regenerate but it did not befall christ who was perfectly holy the third is a combate of diverse desires vpon sundrie respectes drawing a man too and fro this may be in mans nature without fault and was in christ in whome the desire of doing his fathers will striving and struggling with another desire whereby nature seekes to preserue it selfe caused him to pray in this manner the sixt point is in what maner christ prayed ansvver hee prayed to his father partly kneeling partly lying on his face and that with strong cries and teares sweating vvater and blood and all this hee did for our sinnes here then behold the agonie of christ as a cleare crystall in which we may fully see the exceeding greatnesse of our sinnes as also the hardnesse of our hearts we goe vaunting with our heads to heauen as though it were nothing to sinne against god whereas the horrour of the wrath of god for our rebellions brought downe euen the son of god himselfe and laid him groueling vpon the earth and wee can not so much almost as shed one teare for our iniquities whereas hee sweates bloode for vs oh let vs therefore learne to abase our selves and to carrie about us contrite and bleeding hearts and be confounded in our selues for our sinnes past the last point is the euent of the prayer in that it vvas heard as the authour of the hebrewes saith christ iesus in the dayes of his flesh did offer vp vnto his father prayers and supplications with strong cries and teares vnto him that was able to saue him and vvas also hearde in that thing vvhich he feared but some will say how vvas christ heard seeing he suffered death and bare the pangs of hell and the full vvrath of god if hee had beene hearde he shoulde haue beene delivered from all this ans vve must knowe that god heares our prayers two vvaies i when hee directly graunts our request ii vvhen knovving vvhat is good for vs he giues not vs our requests directly but a thing ansvverable therunto and thus vvas christ heard for he was not deliuered from suffering but yet he had strength and povver giuen him vvhereby his manhood vvas made able to beare the brunt of god wrath and in the same manner god heareth the prayers of his servant upon earth paul prayed to be deliuered from the angell satan that buffe ed him but the lord answered that it must not so be because his grace vvherby he vvas inabled to resist his tepta ion vvas sufficient amp paul finding the fruit of his praiers on this maner protestes hereupo that he vvill reioyce in his infirmities others pray for teporall blessings as health life libertie ampc which notwithstanding god holds back and gives in stead thereof spirituall graces patience faith contentation of minde augustine saith god heares not our prayers alwaies according to our willes and desires but according as the things asked shall be for our salvation he is like the phisition who goes on to launch the wound and heares not the patient though he crie never so till the cure be ended novve followeth the second thing to be considered in christs apprehension namely the dealing of the iewes wherein we must consider foure things i how they consult togither concerning christes apprehension ii howe they came to the place and mette him iii how they laid hands on him iiii how they bound him and tooke him away for the first before they enterprised this matter they did wisely and warily lay their heads togither to consult of the time and place and also of the manner of apprehending him so s matthevv saith there assembled togither the chiefe priests and the scribes and the elders of the people into the hall of the chiefe priest called caiphas and consulted how they might take iesus by subtiltie whence wee learne two good instructions first the iewes hauing a quarrell against christ could never be at rest till they had his blood and therefore they consult hovv they might take him but god did so order the matter and dispose of their purposes and consultations that hereby he did both confound them and their nation for by reason of this heynous sinne against christ came the iust vvrath of god upon them and so remaineth unto this day vvhereby vvee see that those vvhich vvill be vvise vvithout the direction of god vvord and against christ the lord vvill ouerthrowe them in their ovvne vvisdome and thus it vvas vvith achitophel vvho for vvisedome vvas as the oracle of god yet because he rebelled against the lord anointed god confounded him in his ovvne vvisdome for vvhen his counseil vvhich he gaue against dauid vvas not folovved he thought himselfe dispised as the text saith and sadled his asse and arose and vvent home into his citie and put his houshold in order and hanged himselfe wherein he shewed himselfe more senselesse then a bruite beast and in our daies the leagers that haue bound themselues by othe to roote out the church of god by his most wonderfull providence turne their swords against themselues and destroy ech other therefore if wee will be wise we must learne to be wise in christ for els our counsell will be our owne confusion secondly hence wee learne that if man will liue in their stubbernnesse and rebellion against christ the lord will so carrie and order those man or that people that they shalbe the causes of their owne perdition this wee may plainely see in the example of these iewes for they evermore envied christ and now they goe on to take counsell against him but god so disposed of it that thereby they brought destruction vpon themselues amp theit cuntry this must teach thee to take heed how thou livest in thy sinnes for if thou doe so the lord hath many waies to worke thy confusion as thy conscience to condemne thee thy friends to forsake thee the divell amp his angels to torment amp molest thee amp his creatures to annoy thee yes the lord can leaue all these and make thine owne selfe to be the direct meanes of working thine owne confusion both in body and soule eternally and that euen then when thou article most wary and wise in thine owne behalfe amp this is the reward of all those that walke on in their euill waies hauing consulted in the next place they come to the garden vvhere christ was to be apprehended and here wee are to consider who they were that came namely the scribes and pharises the high priests and their servant a band of soldiers and the servant of pontius pilate and the elders of the iewes all which came with one consent to the place where christ was that they might attach him vvhere we may learne a good lesson that all sorts of wicked man disagreeing among themselues ca agree against christ the scribes and pharises were two contrary sectes and at discord one with another in matters of religion and iudas was one of christs disciples the elders differed from them all the souldiers were gentiles all these were at variance among themselues and could not one brooke another so also we read that herode and pontius pilate vvere not friends but at the same time when christ was apprehended pilate sent him to herode and they were made friends now as these wicked man did all conspire against christ so doe the wicked ones of this vvorld in all cuntries and kingdomes bande themselues against the church of christ at this day and howsoeuer such be at discorde among themselues yet they doe all ioyne hand in hande to persecute christ in his members and the reason is plaine because christ and his religion is as flat opposite to the corrupt disposition of all man as light is to darkenesse againe vvhereas we see so many sortes of man so amiably consenting to take christ we may note how all man naturally doe hate and abhorre him and his religion and looke as then it was with christ so hath it bene with all his members and will be to the end of the world they are accounted as the offscouring of the world man not worthie to live on the face of the earth as christ tolde his disciples saying ye shall be hated of all nation for my names sake let us also marke how all these came furnished to apprehend christ the text saith they came with clubs amp staves as vnto a thiefe all the whole nation of the iewes knevve right well that christ was no man of violence but meeke and humble and yet they came armed to apprehend him as though he had ben some mightie potentate that would not haue beene apprehended but haue resisted them where wee doe see the propertie of an euill conscience which is to feare where there is no cause at all this causeth some to be afraid of their owne shadovves amp if they see but a vvorme peepe out of the ground they are at their wits end and as salomon saith the wicked flee when none pursueth them after that they are now come to christ we are to consider two things in their meeting i christs communication with them ii the treason of iudas concerning their conference it is said iesus knowing all things that should come vnto him went forth and said unto them whome seeke yee they answered him iesus of nazareth iesus answered i am he now so soone as he had said i am he the stoutest of them fell to the ground as being astonished at the maiestie of his word where note that the word of god is a vvord of power the same povver vvas in his vvord vvhen he raised up lazarus for when he had yen in the graue amp had entred into some degrees of corruption he did no more but said lazarus come forth amp he that vvas dead came forth and hence we may also marke vvhat a wonderfull might and povver is in the vvord preached for it is the very worde of christ and therfore being preached by his ministers lawfully called by him therunto hath the same power amp force in it which christ himselfe shewed vvhen he spake on earth it is the savour of life unto life to saue those that heare it or the savour of death unto death it is like to a vapour or perfume in the aire which in some mens nosthrilles is savourie and pleasant and doeth reviue them and others it striketh starke dead and therefore everie one that either now or heretofore hath heard this vvord preached shall find it to be vnto them either a word of povver to saue their soules or through their corruption the ministerie of death and condemnation againe if a vvorde spoken by him being in a base and lovve estate be able to overthow his enemy then at the last day when he shall come in his glorie and power and maiestie to iudge both the quicke and the dead vvhat povver shall his vvordes haue goe you cursed of my father into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devill amp his angels the consideration of this that the word of christ shall euen be as povverfull at that day must be a motiue to euerie one of vs to cause us to come vnto christ and vvhile vvee haue time in these dayes of grace and mercie to seeke to be reconciled vnto him for all our sinnes least at the last day wee heare that dreadfull voice of christ sounding against vs goe ye cursed into everlasting fire ampc and thus much for the communication now followeth iudas his treason wherein vvee are to obserue these things i the qualities and conditions of the man that did the treason he vvas by calling a disciple chosen to be an apostle vvhich is the chiefest in ecclesiasticall callings amp among the disciples he was in some account because hee vvas as it were a stewarde in christes family and bare the bagge but yet hee was a traitour and did more against christ then all the iewes did for he brought them to the place where they might apprehend him and when they were come did point him out unto them and delivered him into their hands nay he gaue them a signe and token saying vvhome i kisse he it is take him and lead him avvay warily here we see the cause why christ called iudas a divell for he said have i not chosen you twelve and one of you is a divell hee became to be a devill and a traitour by nourishing a wicked and a covetous heart and here we are taught that the ministers of christ if they make no conscience of sinne by the iust iudgement of god do prooue devil incarnate this exaple of iudas doth manifest the same and the reason is plaine for the more knowledge a man hath the more wicked he is if he vvant grace they are like in this case unto a man that hath meate amp drinke enough but no stomacke to digest it and so the more he eateth the more it turneth to his hurt this i speake not to deface the callings of ministers but that those vvhich preach god vvorde should not doe it with impenitent hearts living in their owne sinnes for it is a fearefull thing for a man to speake unto the people of the pardon of their sins and yet himselfe not to apprehend the same by faith a lumpe of vvax if you keepe it from heate or from the fire it keepes his ovvne forme still but if it be helde to the fire it melts and runnes abroad so ministers who by reason of their callings come neare god if they be lumps of iniquity amp liue in their sins they shall find that the corruptions of their hearts wil melt abroad as wax at the fire and therfore every one that is designed to this calling must first purge him selfe of his ovvne sinnes or else god iudgements vvill fall on him as they did on iudas that betraied christ secondly let vs consider vvhat mooued iudas to betray his master namely the desire of vvealth and gaine amp this couetousnesse vvhich is an insatiable desire of money is the roote of all sinne not that all sinnes came of it but because vvhere it is there all other sinnes are preserved and doe get strength the desire of thirtie peeces of siluer caused iudas to make an agreement with the iewes and to betray his master but some will say this practise of iudas is strange and no man that liueth now would do the like for any money ansvver iudas is dead indeede but his practise is yet aliue for in the high and waightie calling of the ministery he that hath charge of soules and either cannot teach and feed his flock or else will not though he betray not christ yet he betrayes the members of christ unto the deuill if a nource should take a mans child to bring up and yet neuer giue it milke insomuch that the childe dieth for hunger is not shee the murtherer of it yes verely and so it is with him that taketh upon him the charge of god people and neuer feedes them with the milke of god vvorde or els so seldome that their soules doe famish he is the murtherer of them and hath betraied them into the handes of their enemie and shall be condemned for them as a traitour unto god unlesse he repent besides those that liue by traffic in buying and selling make gaine by lying swearing and breaking the lordes sabaoth they are also iudasses for they choppe avvay their soules with the deuill for a litle gaine and more lamentable is their case because it is harde to finde one of an hundred in the worlde that makes conscience of a lye or of any bad dealing if any gaine at all may come thereby man use to crie out on iudas for betraying christ and well yet they themselues for a litle worldely pelfe betray their owne soules and if such would not be counted iudasses they must leaue off to sinne amp keepe a good conscience in god worship amp the works of their callings thirdly let us note what course iudas tooke in betraying christ hee was verie submisse saying haile master and kissed him vvhy did he so herein hee played the most palpable hypocrite for hauing gotten a peece of money he thought that neither christ nor any of his fellowe disciples should haue knowne of it though christ knew it well enough amp therefore he comes in this manner to him thinking that he would haue conveighed him selfe from amongst them at the verie pinch as he had done often times before and this practise also of iudas is common in the world iudas an enymie vnto christ speakes him faire and salutes him and so do most of our secure and drowsie protestats in england they will salute christ both by hearing his worde and receauing his sacramentes and as the prophet saith they honour god with their lips but their heartes are farre from him wee may see daylie experience of this everie man will say lord lord but in there lives amp conversations few there be that deny him not both in the dutyes which they owe unto god and also towardes there brother many wil come to heare god word because they are compelled by the magistrates laws but when they are come they worship not god in therehearts which is plainly seene by the breach of god holie saboth in euerie place and that they make more account of a messe of pottage with esau then of their birth right and of peices of siluer than of christ the pointe to be handled in christes apprehension is that they lay hand on him wherein we must consider things i the resistance made by christs disciples ii their flight for the first christs disciples resisted and principally peter drawing his sword stroke one of the hye priests seruats amp cut off his eare this fact our sauiour christ reproues amp that for these causes i because his disciples were priuat man amp they that came to apprehend him were magistrates secondly he was to worke the worke of mans redemption now peter by this did what he could to hinder him and fro this practise of peter we may learn that nothing in the worlde is so hard unto a man as to take vp his crosse amp follow christ one would thinke it should be a harde matter for him to encounter with enemy especially they being stroger then hee but peter stoutly resisting makes nothinge of yt whereas a litle before when christ tould him amp the rest concerning his passion they were so heavie with griefe that they could not hold vp there heads so hard a thing it is to beare the crosse and for this cause afterward when christ reprooued him for striking both he amp all the rest of the disciples fledde away secondly peter in all mens reason was to be comended because he strake in the defece of his master but christ reproves him for it whence we learne that if a ma be zealous for christ he must be zealous within the copasse of his calling and not be zealous first amp then look for a calling but first looke for a calling amp then be zealous which thinge if peter had marked he had not delt so rashlie for being without the compasse of his calling hee could not but doe amisse heere it may be demauded whether christ and his religion may not be maintained by the sworde i answere that the magistrate which is the vicegerent of the lord is the keeper of both tables amp therfore is to maintaine religion with the sworde and so may put to death both atheistes which hold there is no god of which sorte there is many in these daies and hertiques which maliciously maintaine amp hold any thing that ouerthrowes religio in the churches whereof they were members but some obiect that in the parable of the field the servant are commanded not to pluck up the tares from the wheat but to suffer both to grow till haruest and that therefore there must be no separation of heritiques and true christians before the last daye of iudgement answer the scope of that place is not to forbid the execution of heritiques but it speaks only of the finall separation which must be in the end of the world for there the master of the familie doth signifie god him selfe and the field the church militant spread ouer the face of the whole earth amp by tares is ment not only heritiques but also all those that are forth of the church the seruantes are god holie angels and the haruest is the last iudgement here further it may be demaunded who may use the sworde answere that man may use the sworde to strike and to kill into whose hands god putteth the sworde now god putteth it into the hand first and principally of the publicke magistrate who when iust occasion serues may draw it out and againe into a private mans hand sometime a priuate man when he is assailed of his enemie may take the sword in way of his owne defence and may kill his enemie therewith if there be no other helpe not doing it upon malice but because he can not otherwise escape and saue his owne life and so for want of a magistrate he is a magistrate unto himselfe in the flight of the disciples vve may consider things the time and the qualitie of the persons the time was at the apprehension of our lord and sauiour and this came to passe not without the speciall providence of god that it might be knowen that christ had no helper or fellowe in the accomplishment of the worke of our redemption amp that whereas we for our sinnes deserued to be forsaken of all creatures hee being our pledge and suretie might be forsaken for vs as for the qualitie of the persons that flie they were the chosen disciples of christ such as had beleeved in him confessed him and preached in his name and this serueth to teach vs that god will otherwiles forsake his owne children and servant and leaue them to themselues in some part that they may feele their wants amp miseries and their weaknes in themselues and by that means be hubled throughly amp be touched with an hungering desire after christ as a mother sets downe her young child amp hides her selfe suffering it to crie amp breake the face not because she hates it but that she may teach it to depend upon her amp loue her so god giueth grace to his children amp yet againe somtime he doth in part withdraw it from them amp then they faile in their duties sundry waies amp this he doth to make them ashamed of themselues amp to cause them to put all their cofidece out of theselues in the merits of christ the fourth thing to be considered in christes apprehension is their binding of him in which action of theirs wee are to obserue first of all the circumstance of time when this binding vvas vvhen our sauiour christ had saide unto them i am hee they being astonished fell to the ground and vvithall vvhen peter had smitten off malchus eare with his sworde christ healed the same miraculously yet after all this though they saw his wonderfull povver both in vvorde and deede they proceede in malice against him and lay hands on him and binde him as a malefactour in this wee note what a fearefull sinne hardnesse of heart is the danger whereof appeareth in this that if a man be taken vvith it there is nothing that can stay or daunt him in his wicked proceedings no not the povverfull vvordes and deedes of christ himselfe and indeed among god iudgements there is none more fearefull then this and hovv fearefull soeuer it be it is to be founde amongst us in these daies for it is verie euident by common experience that the more man are taught the doctrine of the lawe and of the gospell the more hard and senselesse are their hearts like unto the stithie which the more it is beaten upon with the iron hammer the harder it is and againe it is hard to finde man that sorrow for their sinnes and feele the vvant of christ which argueth the exceeding deadnesse of spirit and let vs be resolued that it is a most terrible iudgement of god the rather to be feared because it is like a pleasant sleepe into which when a man is fallen he feeles neither paine nor griefe and therfore we for our parts must looke unto it with feare amp trembling lest it take such hold of us that we be past all hope of recoverie furthermore this binding of christ was prefigured unto us in the sacrifices of the old testament for the beast that was to be sacrificed vvas tyed vvith cords and bound amp so brought to the altar and wheras christ is bound vve must not consider him in his owne person but as he standing in our roome and steade beares the person of all sinners and therefore vvhereas he is thus taken captive by his enemy to be brought before a mortall iudge there to be arraigned for us hence we learne two good instructions first here is a comfort to all the people of god christ was bound by his enemy that they might be unloosed from the bondage of satan sinne amp their owne corruptions under which they lie bound by nature and might have free libertie in amp by him secondly all impenitent sinners are taught hereby to reforme and amend their hearts and liues for vvhat exceeding madnesse is this that they by christs bonds being set at libertie will yet liue and die in their sinnes and take pleasure to lie bound hand and foote vnder the power of sinne amp sathan and indeed this sheweth unto us the fearefull amp dangerous estate of all those that goe on still in their sinnes for what can they say for themselues at the day of iudgement when as now they haue freedome offered and will not accept of it thus much of christes apprehension now followeth the inditement for they proceed against him iudicially after the custome of the iewes christs inditement was twofold one before caiphas the high priest in the great councell at ierusalem the second before the civill iudge pontius pilate as is plainely set forth by all the euangelistes and christs arraignement before caiphas was a preparation to the second before pontius pilate that the iewes might throughly proceed against him in the first we are to consider these points i the time in which christ was indited ii the end of his inditement iii the whole tenour amp proceeding thereof for the first christ was indited earely in the morning at the breake of the day for he was apprehended in the night amp with all hast brought into caiphas his hall amp there they kept him all night amp at the breake of the day caiphas the high priest amp the elders with the scribes amp pharises held a solemne councell against him amp there they had accused him and condemned him before morning amp sent him then to the common hall as s matthew saith when the morning was come all the chiefe priestes amp elders of the people tooke counsell against iesus to put him to death and lead him away bound amp deliuered him to pontius pilate in which action of theirs we are to marke two points first the diligence of vngodly man amp the quicknes of their nature to practise sinne amp wickednes as it was said of the old iewes their feet runne to euill amp they make hast to shed blood when the israelites would sacrifice to the golden calfe which they had made it is said they rose up early in the morning hence it appeares that if god leaue us to our selues we are as ready to practise any mischiefe as the fire is to burne without delay and with violence now the consideration of this must mooue euerie one of us to take heed of all occasions amp provocations to sinne whatsoeuer they be that it breake not foorth any way secondly in the circumstance of time of this councell we may marke the rashnes of this solemne assembly in iudiciall proceedings whereas they examine him both of his doctrine and also of his disciples omitting such circumstances as should haue bin used as the serious examining of witnesses amp the waynig of his cotrarie answers for he is take amp brought before the iudge amp codened on a sudde now as this was the practise of this councel so on the cotrary the comon coplaint of these times is of the slow dispatch of matters in lawe and of the long delay insomuch that some be almost undone before their suits be ended wheras iudiciall proceedings were ordained by god not for mens undoing but for the maintaining of the common peace and libertie and wealth and therefore iustice ought to be dispatched with such speed as man thereby might be furthered and not hindred the end of christs inditement was directly to kill him amp to put him to death here is no indifferent proceeding to be looked for but plotting on euery had for the very blood of christ where note that in the hearts of all wicked man there is an ingrafted hatred of christ amp as it were bred in the bone amp the same affectio they cary to the mebers of christ this hatred is manifested in the first giuing of the promise i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seede it appeares in the hatred that cain bare to his brother abel ismael towards isaac esau towards iacob amp the gentiles that were without the couenant towards the church of god at all times and to come nere to our selues this ingrafted hatred that is in the heart of the wicked against christ amp his members is as plentifull amp euident as euer it was euen in these our daies for among all man none are more maligned amp hated then those that professe christ amp for none other cause but because they professe christ and hereupon the very profession of religion is laden with nicknames and reprochfull termes by all sortes of man and thus much of the end and intent of their counsell the proceeding in iudgement standes in these pointes i they examine christ ii they bring witnesses against him iii they adiure him to tell them who he is of these in order first they examine our saviour christ of his doctrine suspecting him to be a false prophet secondly of his disciples as suspecting him seditiously to raise up a new sect unto himselfe to make a faction amongst the iewes nowe to this examination let us marke christs answere in which hee saieth nothing at all concerning his disciples whereas notwithstanding he might haue said that one of them betraied him another denied him and the rest fled away whereby wee note that it is not our dutie at all times and in all places to speake of the faultes and wantes that we know by others secondly the answere which he makes is onely concerning his doctrine whereby the ministers of god and all man els are taught that being called before their enemy to giue reason of their doctrine they are as s peter saith to be alwayes ready to give an account of the hope that is in them and further wee are to consider the wisedome that christ useth in answering for he saith nothing of his doctrine in particular but said i speake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whether the iewes resorted in secret have i taught nothing aske them therefore what i saide which heard me behold they can tell you vvhat i said now the reason why he answereth thus sparingly in generall tearmes is because their examination serued only to intangle him and out of his words to gather matter of accusation after whose example wee may learne that being called to make answere of our faith amp doctrine before our enemy we are to do it so as thereby we do not intangle our selues nor giue any advantage unto our enemy and hereof we haue a notable example in the apostle paul act in the words of christes answere we must obserue things first that the place vvhere christ taught was publi e now hence it may be demaded whether ministers may handle the word of god privately or no ans the state of god church is twofold peaceable or troblesome in the time of peace ministers must preach the word publikely but in time of persecution for the safetie and preseruation of the church of god they may with good warrant preach priuately and indeed at such times the assemblies of the church make priuate places publike and hence we learne that in time of peace all those that are called to the office of the ministerie must if it be possible spend their labour publikely so as they may doe most good secondly whereas christ saith he preached in their synagogues and temple which at that time were places full of disorder in so much as he called the temple a denne of theeues and the scribes and pharisies had corrupted the doctrine of the law transgressing the commaundements of god by their owne traditions and they taught iustification by the works of the law as paul saith they beeing ignorant of the righteousnes of god and going about to stablish their owne righteousnes which is by workes haue not submitted themselues to the righteousnes of god besides all this they were loose and wicked man in their liues and conuersations amp therefore christ commaunded the people that they should obserue and doe whatsoeuer the scribes and pharisies bidde them sitting in moses chaire but after their workes they must not doe because they say and doe not now although these corruptios amp deformities were in the iewish church yet our sauiour christ severed not from it but came and preached both in their temple amp synagogues where these seducers and false teachers were and hence we gather that the practise of all those man in our church which separate themselues from all assemblies for the wants thereof holding that our church is no church that the grace which is wrought by the preaching of the word among vs is nothing else but a sathanicall illusion that our sacraments are no sacraments i say this their practise is condemned by our sauiour christs conversing among the iewes for if christ should haue followed their opinion hee ought to haue fled from amongst the iewes and not so much as once to haue come into the teple or taught in their synagogues but contrariwise he ioyned himselfe with them and therefore wee can not in good conscience disjoyne our selues from the church of england the second thing to be obserued in christs answeare is that he referres caiphas to the iudgement of his hearers beeing resolued of the truth of his owne doctrine though sundrie of them were his vtter enemy behold then a good example for all the ministers of god word to follow teaching them to deliuer god word so purely and syncerely that if they be called into question about the same they may be bolde to appeale to the consciences of their hearers although they be wicked man now after this answer one of the servant of caiphas smites christ with a rodde in whome the saying is verified like master like servant that is if the master be wicked servant commonly will be wicked also if the master be an enemie to christ his servant will be christs enemie also and this is the cause why there are so many lewd prentises and servant because there are so many lewd masters many masters complaine of servant now adaies but there is more cause why they should complaine of themselues for vsually servant will not become obedient to their masters till their masters first become obedient vnto christ therefore let masters learne to obey god and then their servant will obey them also further christ beeing smitten makes this answeare if i haue euill spoken beare witnesse of the euill but if i haue well spoken why smitest thou me making complaint of an iniurie done vnto him now hereupon scoffing iulian the apostata saith christ keepes not his owne laws but goeth against his owne precept when as he saide if one strike thee on the one cheeke turn to him the other also but we must know that in these words christs meaning is that a ma must rather suffer a double wrong then seeke a priuate reuenge and before christ spake in his owne defence which a man may lawfully doe and not seeke any reuenge for it is one thing to defend his owne cause and an other to seeke reuenge now follows the secod point in their proceeding which is the producing of false witnesses against him as s matthew saith the whole councell sought false witnesse against him and though many came yet found they none for they could not agree together because they alleadged false things against him which they could not prooue and thus the mebers of christ haue often such enemy as make no bones shamefully to auouch that against them which they ca not be able to iustifie the ten persecutions which were in the first yeares after christ arose oftentimes of shamelesse reports that man gaue out which said that christians liued of mans flesh amp therfore slew their owne children that they liued on rawe flesh that they committed incest one with another in their assemblies that they worshipped the head of an asse that they worshipped the sune amp moone that they were traytours amp sought to vndermine the romane empyre amp lastly wheresoeuer was thunder or earthquakes seditios or tumults or any disquietnes or trouble christians were accused as the authors thereof such enemy haue they had in all ages and in these our daies the same is practised amp will be to the worlds end now when the first witnesses could not agree among themselues then two other false witnesses came forth which auouched that christ said i will destroy this temple made with hands amp within three daies will build another made without hads indeed christ said some such wordes for saith he destroy this temple and within three daies i will build it vp againe but he spake this of the temple of his bodie whereas they maliciously did interpret him to haue spoken of the temple in ierusalem and againe they chaunge the words for christ said destroy this temple ampc but these witnesses say he said i will destroy this temple made with hands ampc and thus they chaunge both words and meaning and therefore the holy ghost calleth them false witnesses by this we must be aduertised to take heede how we report mens words for if we chaunge the meaning though in part we retaine the words we may soone become slaunderers and false witnesses and as this duetie must be performed towards all man so especially towards the ministers of the gospell amp the neglect of this dutie procureth many slaunderers to the in this our church whereof indeed the reporters are the cause and not the ministers themselues now at this false accusation christ was silent so as caiphas asked him why he answeared nothing herein wee are to consider many things i why christ was silent the causes be two first he was to shew himselfe a patterne of true humilitie and patience therefore euen then would he be silent when he was most falsely accused of his aduersaries secondly he is silent that standing before the iudge to be condemned the sentence might proceede against him and he might suffer the death appointed which was due vnto vs and so become our redeemer and in christs example we must note that it is a speciall dutie to knowe when to speake and when to be silent the ordering of the tongue is a rare gift and few attaine vnto it some will peradventure aske what rule we haue to direct vs herein answer the generall rule for the ordering of the tongue is the law of god we are commaunded to seeke the glorie of god in the first table and in the second the good of our neighbour when thy speach therefore will serue either for god glorie or the good of thy neighbour then thou must speake if it serue for neither then be silent againe if thy silence be either for god glorie or the good of thy neighbour then be silent if it will not then speake and because it is hard for a man to know when his speach or silence will serue for these two ends therefore we must pray vnto god that he would teach and direct vs herein as dauid doth set a watch saith he o lord before my mouth and keepe the doore of my lippes and againe open thou my lippes o lord and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise thus much for the false witnesses produced now followeth the third point which is the adjuring of christ for caiphas the high priest charged him to tell him whether he were the christ the son of god or no to adiure a man is to charge and commaund him in the name of god to declare a truth not onely because god is witnesse thereof but also because he is iudge to reuenge if he speake not the truth thus paul adiured the thessalonians charging them in the lord that his epistle should be read vnto all the brother the saints and the like doth caiphas to christ and here is a thing to be wondered at caiphas the high priest adjureth him in the name of god who is very god euen the son of god which shewes what a small account he makes of the name of god for he did it onely to get aduantage on christs words and so doe many nowe adaies who for a little profit or gaine make a matter of nothing to abuse the name of god a thousand waies now christ beeing thus adjured though silent before yet now in reuerence to god maiestie answeared amp said first thou hast said it and in saint marke i am he in this answeare appeares the wonderfull prouidence of god for though caiphas take hence the occasion of condemning christ yet hath he withall drawne from him a most excellent confession that he is the son of god and our alone sauiour and by this meanes he proceeds to shut heauen against himselfe and to open the same for vs thus we haue ended the first inditement of christ before caiphas nowe followeth the second which was before pontius pilate in the common hall at ierusalem the historie of it is set downe at large in all the evangelists in this second inditement of christ that we may referre euery matter to his place we are to obserue foure things i the accusation of christ before pilate ii his examination iii pilats pollicie to saue christ iv pilats absolving of him and then the condemnation of christ in both courts ecclesiasticall and civill of these in order in christs accusation wee must consider many points the first is who were his accusers namely the high priest the scribes and pharisies and elders of the people and the common people all these conspired together to accuse him the cause that mooued the pharisies and elders of the people hereunto is noted by saint matthew who saith of envy they deliuered him envie is nothing but a sadnes in a mans heart at the prosperitie of his better and it raigned in the scribes and pharisies and the occasion was this christ had taught most heauenly doctrine and confirmed the same by most wonderfull miracles and did greatly exceede them all and was in more account among the people and for this cause the scribes and pharisies and high priests repined amp grudged at him nowe their example serues to admonish vs to take heed of this sinne as beeing the mother of many mischiefes and we must rather follow the example of moses who when iosua desired him to forbid eldad and medad to prophecie answeared enviest thou for my sake yes i would to god that all the lord people were prophets and we must be of the same minde with john baptist who hearing by his disciples that the people left him and followed christ said his ioy was fulfilled for christ must increase and he must decrease and so we must be glad and content when we see the prosperitie of our neighbours any way nowe the cause why the common people ioyne with them was because the chiefe priests and the scribes amp elders had perswaded them to a bad conceit of christ hence it appeares that it is most requisite for any people be they neuer so good to haue good magistrates amp godly rulers to gouerne them by wise and godly counsell the necessitie hereof was well knowne to iethro moses father in lawe though hee were a heathen man for he biddeth moses to prouide among all the people man of courage fearing god man dealing truly hating couetousnes and appoint them to be rulers ouer the people teaching vs that if couetous malitious and vngodly man not fearing god goe before the people they shall in all likelihood be caried into the like sinnes by their example the next point concernes the place where they accuse him which was at the doore of the common hall for hauing brought him before the councell at ierusalem and there condemned him of blasphemie afterward they bring him vnto the common hall where pilate sate iudge yet did they not enter in but staied without at the doore least they should be defiled and be made vnfitte to eate the passeover in which practise of theirs we are to marke an exaple of most notable both superstition amp most grosse hypocrisie for they make no bones to accuse amp arraigne a ma most iust amp innocent and yet are very strickt and curious in an outward ceremonie and in like manner they made no conscience to giue thirtie pieces of siluer to betray christ but to cast the same into the treasurie they make it a great and hainous offence and for this cause christ pronounceth a woe vnto the scribes and pharisies calling them hypocrites for saith he you tithe mynt anyse and commin and leaue the weightie matters of the lawe as iudgement and mercie and the very same thing wee see practised of the church of rome at this day and of sundrie papists that liue amongst vs they will not eate flesh in lent or vpon any of the popes fasting daies for any thing and yet the same man make no conscience of seeking the bloud of the lord annointed and their dread soueraigne and in this wee see the most palpable and most grosse hypocrisie of those that be of that church but shall we thinke that our own church is free from such man no assuredly for take a viewe of the profession that is vsed among the people of england and it will appeare that they place their whole religion for the most part in the obseruation of certain ceremonies the manner of most man is to come to the place of assemblies where god is worshipped and there mumble vp the lord prayer the commaundements and the beliefe in stead of prayers which beeing done god is well serued thinke they whereas in the meane season they neglect to learne and practise such things as are taught them for their saluation by the ministers of god word at the feast of easter euery man will be full of deuotion and charitie and come to receiue the sacraments as though hee were the holiest man in the world but when the time is past all generally turne to their old biace againe and all the yeare after liue as they list making no conscience of lying slaundering fraude and deceit in their affaires among man but we must knowe that there is no soundnes of religion but grosse hypocrisie in all such man they worshippe god with their lippes but there is no power of godlines in their hearts the point is cocerning the partie to whom they make this accusation against him namely not to a iew but to a gentile for hauing condemned him in their ecclesiasticall court before caiphas the high priest they bring him to pontius pilate the deputy of tiberius caesar in iudea where we must obserue the wonderful prouidence of god in that not onely the iewes but the gentiles also had a stroake in the arraignement of christ that that might be true which the apostle saith god shut vp all vnder sinne that he might haue mercie vpon all the fourth point is the matter of their accusation they accuse our sauiour christ of things i that he seduced the people ii that he forbad to pay tribute to caesar iii that he said he was a king let vs well consider these accusations especially the two last because they are flat contrarie both to christs preaching and to his practise for when the people would haue made him a king after hee had wrought the myracle of the fiue loaues and two fish the text saith he departed from among them vnto a mountaine himselfe alone secondly when tribute was demaunded of him for caesar though he were the kings son and therefore was freed yet saith he to peter least wee should offende the go to the sea and cast in an angle and take the first fish that commeth vp and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt finde a piece of twentie pence that take and giue vnto them for thee and me and when he was called to be a iudge to deuide the inheritance betweene two brother he refused to doe it saying who made me a iudge betweene you therefore in these two things they did most falsely accuse him whereby wee learne that nothing is so false and vntrue but the slaunderer dare lay it to the charge of the innocent the tongues of the slaunderers are sharpe swords amp venemous arrows to wound their enemy their throats are open sepulchers the poyson of aspes is vnder their lipps if a man speake gracious words his tongue is touched with the fire of god spirit but as saint iames saith the tongue of the wicked is fire yes a worlde of wickednes and it is set on fire with the fire of hell therefore let this example be a caveat for vs all to teach vs to take heede of slandering for the deuill then speakes by vs and kindles our tongues with the fire of hell the fifth point is the manner of their accusation which is diligently to be marked for they doe not onely charge him with a wonderfull vntruth but they beg pilate to put him to death crying vniustly for a blasphemer by their law should be stoned and not crucified crucifie him crucifie him in so much that pontius pilate was afraid of them where wee may see how these shameles iewes goe beyond their compasse and the bounds of all accusers whose dutie is to testifie onely what they know now in the matter of this their accusation appeares their wonderfull inconstancie for a little before when christ came to ierusalem riding vpon an asse shewing some signes of his kingly authoritie they cut downe braunches from the trees and strawed them in the way crying hosanna blessed is hee that commeth in the name of the lord but nowe they sing an other song and in stead of hosanna they cry crucifie him crucifie him and the like inconstancie is to be found in the people of these our times they vse to receiue any religion that is offered vnto them for in the daies of king edward the sixth the people of england receiued the gospell of christ but shortly after in queene maries time the same people receiued the wretched and abhominable doctrine of the church of rome and not many yeares after when it pleased god to bring againe the light of his glorious gospell by our gracious prince the same people turned from popery and imbraced the true religion againe and thus with the iewes one while they cry hosanna to christ amp receiue his gospell and shortly after they cry crucifie him crucifie him by imbracing idolatrous popery let vs therefore learne in the feare of god by the ficklenes of the iewes that sing two contrarie songs in so short a space to acknowledge our inconstancie and weakenesse in the matter of religion whereby if god leaue vs but a little to our selues wee shall straight way forsake christ his gospell and all thus much of the accusation now followeth christs examination before pontius pilate for when the iewes had thus falsely accused him then pontius pilate tooke him and brought him into the common hall and asked him this question article thou a king nowe christ beeing thus examined made as paul also testifieth a good confession the summe thereof stands in foure heads the first is that he confesseth himselfe to be a king not such an one as they accused him to be yet a true king whence we may learne diverse instructions first that euery christian man in the midst of his misery amp afflictio hath one that is most sufficiet euery way to defend him against all his enemy the world the flesh amp the deuill for this king can doe whatsoeuer he will amp therfore when the legion of devil would enter into a herd of swine they could not without his leaue and when the centurions daughter was dead he but spake the word and she arose and when lazarus was dead and had li n in the graue foure daies he but said lazarus come forth amp he came forth bound hand and foote yes euen hell and death giue place to his word amp nothing can resist his power and therefore he that is a true member of christ needes not to feare any enemy be they neuer so great or so many and againe as christ is able so is he readie and willing to saue and defend all that beleeue in him for he it is that gaue his life for his subiects which no king will doe and shedde his bloud for their redemption which hee would neuer haue done if he had not desired their saluation secondly when as christ is a mightie king which can doe whatsoeuer he wil let al such amog vs that haue hitherto liued in ignorace amp by reason of ignorace liue in their sinnes at length begin to come vnto him amp do him homage amp with penitet hearts fal down before him otherwise if they continue in their old rebellions let them know whosoeuer they be high or low that he hath a rod of iron in his hand to bruise them in pieces their soules shall smart for it as both pilate caiphas amp the rest of the iewes were with a full cup rewarded for crucifying the lord of life and if christ cannot draw thee in this life from thy crooked waies be sure at the houre of death he wil breake thee in pieces like a potters vessel this must wee learne in regarde of the first point that hee saide plainly he was a king now follows the second part of his confession namely that his kingdome was not of this worlde where hee sets downe what kinde of king he is he is no earthly king his kingdome standes not in the power of man nor in earthly and outwarde gouernement but his kingdome is spirituall and his gouernement is in the very heartes and consciences of man his kingdome is not outward to be seene of man but inwarde in the heart and soule and therfore it is onely begunne in this life and is continued and accomplished in the worlde to come in the kingdome of glorie where christ shall be all in all in the hearts and consciences of all the elect nowe then if this be so howsoeuer sathan haue heretofore raigned in vs and made our heartes as it were his pallaces yet nowe let vs prepare a roome for christ that hee may come and dwell in vs let him rule our hearts wills and affections that they may become conformable to his will let vs resigne our selues wholly to be ruled by him that his spiritual kingdom may be in vs this kingdom in the heart amp conscience is the pearle and hid treasure which when a man findeth he sels all that he hath amp buyeth it let vs therfore in the feare of god esteem it as the most pretious thing that may be and so liue in this worlde as that christ may rule inwardly in vs by his word amp spirit and againe seeing this regiment of christ is heauenly amp the full manifestation of it is in the life to come we must therfore vse this world amp all things in it as honour wealth ease amp libertie as though we vsed them not as a trauailer vseth his staffe in his iourney as long as it doth further him so long he will carrie it with him but when it hindereth him then he casts it away so must vve vse the things of this life namely as long as they are helps to further and make vs fitte for the kingdome of heauen but if they be any hinderance to this spirituall regiment of christ wee must renounce them and cast them away be they neuer so pretious to vs the third point of christs confession is concerning the meanes whereby he gouernes his kingdome i came saith he into this world to beare witnes of the truth that is to preach the gospell amp doctrine of saluatio amp herby he teacheth that the outward administration of his kingdome stands specially in the preaching of the word which is a principall ordinance of his seruing to gather his church from the beginning of the world to the end thereof and for this cause he hath in all age set apart chosen ministers for the publishing of the doctrine of the gospell and by this it is manifest that the gift of prophecie is the greatest gift that god bestows on his church for the building thereof and therfore it ought to be most highly esteemed of as a most pretious iewell and for this cause also the schooles of learning are to be reuerenced and maintained and all other meanes vsed for the furthering of them because they are vnder god the fountains and welsprings of this gift of prophecie the last point is concerning the subiects of christs kingdome expressed in these words they which are of the truth heare my voice in which he sets downe the true marke of his servant and subiects that they are hearers of that heauenly and sauing word which he reuealed from the bosome of his father it may be alleadged the most wicked man vpon earth yes the devil themselues may be hearers of the truth of christ answer there be two kind of hearers one which heares onely the outward sound of the word with his bodily eares and he hauing eares to heare doth not heare the second is he that doth not only receiue the doctrine that is taught with his eares but also hath his heart opened to feel the power of it amp to obey the same in the course of his life this distinction is notably set foorth by dauid saying sacrifice and burnt offerings thou wouldest not haue but my eares hast thou pierced whereby hee insinuates as it were two kinds of eares one that is deafe and cannot heare and thus are the eares of al man by nature in hearing the doctrine of saluation the other is a newe eare pearced and bored by the hand of god which causeth a mans heart to heare the sound and operation of the word and the life to expresse the truth of it nowe the subiects of christs kingdome are such as with the outward hearing of the word haue an inward hearing of the soule amp grace also to obey amp therfore al those that make no cosciece of obediece to the word of god preached vnto them are no lesse then rebels to christ we may perswade our selues that we are good subiects because we heare the word and receiue the sacraments but if our liues abound with sinne and if our heartes be not pierced through by the sword of god spirit whether we be high or low rich or poore let vs be what wee will be wee are no right subiects indeede but rebels and traytours vnto the euerliuing god it may be hereafter god will giue further grace but as yet all impenitent persons though liuing in the midst of god church are not obedient amp faithfull subiects and therfore while we haue time let vs labour to performe in deede that which we doe in word professe thus much of the examination and confession of christ nowe followeth the third point concerning the pollicies which pilate vsed to saue christ and they are three first when he heard that christ vvas of galilee he tooke occasion to sende him to herod thinking thereby to shift his hand of him and not to shed his bloode in vvhich pollicie though he seeme vnvvilling to put christ to death yet herein he is a most vniust iudge for hauing giuen testimonie of christ that he is innocent he ought to haue acquitted him and not haue sent him to herod for further iudgement in herods dealing vvith christ vve may obserue these points the first that hee is vvonderfully glad of his comming why so the text saith because he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and trusted to haue seene some signe done by him here marke hovve he reioyced not in christ because he vvas christ that is his messias and redeemer but because he vvrought myracles signes and vvonders and so it is among vs at this day it is a rare thing to finde a man that loueth christ because he is christ some loue christ for honour some for vvealth and others for praise in that they get honour vvealth and praise by confessing his name againe many professe christ onely because it is the lavv and custome of their nation but vvee must learne to be of this minde to loue christ because he is christ euen for himselfe and not for any other sinister respect and vvee must reioyce in christ for himselfe though wee neuer haue profite nor pleasure neither honour or wealth by him and if we loue him for wealth or pleasure or for any other ende but for himselfe alone when these things are taken away then we shall vtterly forsake christ in like manner the second point is that herod desires christ to worke a miracle he can be content to see the works of christ but he can not abide to heare his word amp to beare his yoke like to him are many in these daies which gladly desire to heare the gospell of christ preached onely because they would heare speach of some strange things laying aside all care and conscience to obey that which they heare yes many in england delite to read the strange history of the bible and therefore can rehearse the most part of it and it were to be wished that all could doe it yet come to the practise of it the same persons are commonly found as bad in life and conuersation yes rather worse then others let vs therefore labour that with our knowledge we may ioyne obedience amp practise with our learning and as well to be affected with the word of christ as with his works the third point is that herod derides christ and sends him away cloathed in a white garment this is that herod whome christ called a foxe who also when hee heard john baptist preach did many things amp heard him gladly how then comes herod to this outrage of wickednes thus to abuse christ answer we must knowe that although herod at the first heard john preach yet withall hee followed his owne affections and sought how to fulfill the lustes of his flesh for when john told him that it was not lawful for him to haue his brother philips wife he cast him in prison and after cut off his head for it after which offence he is grown to this height of impietie that he now despiseth christ amp canot abide to heare him where we learne that as we are willing to heare god word preached so withall we must take heede that we practise no maner of sinne but make conscience of euery thing that may displease god thou maist i graunt be one that feares and fauours john baptist for a time wallowing in thy old sinnes but after a while yeilding to the swinge of thy corrupt heart thou wilt neuer heare john nor christ himselfe but hate and despise them both this is the cause why some which haue beene professours of religion heretofore and haue had great measure of knowledge are now become very loose persons and can not abide to heare the worde preached vnto them the reason is because they could not abide to leaue their sinnes therefore that wee may begin in the spirit and not end in the flesh let euery one that calls on the name of the lord depart from iniquitie now follows the second pollicie of pilate for when he saw the first would not preuaile then hee tooke a newe course for he tooke iesus into the common hall and scourged him and the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes and pur it on his head and they put on him a purple garment and saide haile king of the iewes and smote him with their roddes and thus he brought him foorth before the iewes perswading himselfe that when they sawe him so abased and so ignominiously abused they vvould be content therevvith and exact no greater punishment at his handes thinking thus to haue pacified the rage of the ievves and so to haue deliuered christ from death by inflicting vpon him some less punishment this pollicie is as it vvere a looking glasse in vvhich vve may behold of vvhat nature amp codition all plotts amp pollicies of me are which are deuised amp practised vvithout the directio of god vvord in it we may obserue things the first is the ground thereof vvhich is a most silly simple or rather sensles argument for he reasoneth thus i finde no fault in this man therefore i will chastise him and let him goe a man vvould hardly haue thought that one hauing but his common sense vvould not haue made such a reason much lesse a great iudge sitting in the roome of god but in him vve may behold amp see the ground of all humane pollicie vvhich is beside the vvord of god namely the foolish and blind reason of man the thing to be considered is the proceeding and issue of this pollicie pilat must either vvhip christ beeing innocent or put him to death vvhich are both sinnes and great offences novve hee maketh choice of the less vvhich is to whippe him and is perswaded that he ought to doe so whereas of two sinnes or euils a man ought to doe neither and in doing this pilate begins to make a breach in his conscience and that is the fruit that all politicks reape of their deuises which proceede by the light of their owne reason without the word of god by this example we are admonished of two things first that before we enterprize any businesse wee must rectifie our iudgements by god worde dauid was a most wise king and no doubt had withall a graue and wise councell but yet he preferred the word of god before all saying thy testimonies are my counsellers secondly in our proceedings we must keepe an vpright pure and vnblameable conscience as paul exhorteth timothie to haue the mysterie of faith in a pure conscience giuing vs thereby to vnderstand that a good conscience is as it were a chest or cupboard in which we are to keepe and locke vp our religion and all other graces of god as the most pretious iewels that can be and that if we suffer this chest to be broken vp all our riches and iewels are gone but let vs yet view the dealing of pilate more particularly he whippes christ puts on him a purple garment puts a reede in his hand sets a crowne of thornes vpon his head and causes the souldiers to mocke him and spit in his face now in this that christ standing in our roome was thus shamefully abused we must consider what was due vnto euery one of vs for our sinnes namely shame and reproch in this life and in the life to come endles confusion and we see the confession of christ to be true which he made to pilate that his kingdome was not of this world for if it had beene so they would haue put a crowne of gold vpon his head and not a crowne of thornes nothing at all beseeming an earthly king and in stead of a reede they would haue put a scepter into his hand and in stead of buffetting and spitting on him they would haue adored him amp falne downe before him againe whereas christ our heade in this world ware no other crowne but one made of thornes it serueth to teach all those that are the members of christ that they must not look for a crown of glory in this life because that is reserued for the life to come and if we would then weare the crown of glorie with christ we must here in this life weare a crown of thorns as he did for as paul saith if we suffer with christ we shall also raigne with him and that which was fully verified in christ the head must in some part be verified in euery true member of christ pilats third pollicie was this when he saw that neither of the two former would preuaile he comes forth vnto the iewes and makes an oration to this effect that now vvas the feast of the passeouer and that they had a custome that the gouernour should then deliuer vnto the people a prisoner whome they would therefore he asked them whether he should let loose to them barrabas or iesus which is called christ this barrabas was a notable malefactour that with insurrection had committed murther and thus pilate cunningly matcheth christ vvith barrabas thinking that the iewes would rather chuse him then barrabas beeing a notorious malefactour not worthie to liue on the face of the earth and by this meanes he thought to haue deliuered christ fro death though otherwise he accounted him also as a malefactour the ground of this pollicie as we see is an old custome of the iewes that a prisoner should be let loose at easter and it may be the ende of this custome was to increase the solemnitie of the feast but whatsoeuer in truth the end was the fact it selfe was but a prophanation of the time and an abomination before the lord for salomon saith he that iustifieth the wicked and condemneth the iust euen they both are abhomination before the lord the like practise takes place with many in these daies who thinke the lo ds day neuer well spent vnlesse they may adde solemnitie thereunto by revelation and riot by frequenting of taverns and alehouses and furthermore where pilate matcheth christ beeing innocent with barrabas and the people preferre him before christ hauing libertie to chuse eyther it shewes that god in his prouidence had appointed that christ should not stand in his owne roome before pilate but in our roome and stead as a mediatour betweene god and us and in this fact of the people we see how sinne by degrees takes hold of man amp that speedily who would haue thought that these iewes which a little before cryed hosanna and spread their garmentes before christ in the way woulde euer haue preferred a murtherer before him but it was the doing of the high priests the scribes amp phases who did animate and stirre them up to this wickednes and hereupon when they had yeelded first to attach him and then to accuse him they are caried to an higher degree of impietie namely to seeke his blood and least he should escape their handes they plunge themselues deeper yet preferring a wretched murtherer euen seditious barabbas before him this must teach euery one of vs to take heede of the beginnings euen of the least sinnes for the deuill is cunning he will not plunge a man into the greatest sinnes at the first but his manner is by little and little to creepe into the heart and hauing once possession thereof by steppes to bring man to the height of sinne and that with speed we must therefore in the feare of god preuent sinne betimes and at the first motion cut off all occasions hereof that which paul saith of heresie comparing it to a canker or gangreene may be saide of all sinne the nature of the gangren is to runne from one ioynt to another from rhe toe to the foote from the foote to the legge from the legge to the thigh till it haue wasted and destroyed the life of rhe bodie so giue any sinne but an entrance and it will soone ouerspread the whole man and if the deuill may be suffered but to put one talent into thy heart he will presently wind himselfe into thee his head his bodie and all the psalmist saith that he is blessed that taketh the children of the babylonians and dasheth them against the stones and as truly may it be saide blessed is the man that dasheth the head of his sinnes against the ground while they are yong before they get strength to ouer master him thus haue wee seene the pollicies of pilate now followeth the absolution of christ for when pilate had used many meanes to deliuer him amp none would prevaile then hee absolues him by giuing diverse testimonies of his innocencie for he came foorth three times and bare witnesse thereof and last of all hee testified the same by washing of his hands which rite signifieth properly the defiling of the handes before but as yet pilate had not defiled his handes and therefore he used it as a token to shewe that christ vvas innocent and that hee would not defile his owne hands with innocent blood there vvere three causes that mooued pilate to absolue christ first hee sawe that hee vvas a iust man as saint matthew noteth and that the high priests and people had deliuered him vp of envie as s marke saith by this it is plaine that a very pagan or infidell may in some things goe beyond such as be in god church hauing better conscience and dealing more iustly then they pontius pilate was a heathen man and a gentile the iewes vvere the church and people of the liuing god yet he sees plainely that christ was a iust man and thereupon absolues him whereas the iewes which should be man of conscience and religion seeke his death and thus a verie pagan may otherwhiles see more into a matter the those that be reputed of the church and this must admonish all such as professe the gospell to looke unto their proceedings that they doe all things with upright conscience for if wee deale uniustly in our proceedings wee may haue neighbours man of no religion that will looke through us and see the grosse hypocrisie of our profession that would be loth to doe those things which wee doe the second cause that mooued pilate to absolue christ was his wiues dreame for when he was set dovvne upon the iudgement seate shee sent unto him saying have thou nothing to doe vvith that iust man for i have suffered many things in a dreame by reason of him dreames are of three sortes naturall rising from the constitution of the bodie diabolicall such as come by the suggestion of the deuill divine which are from god some haue thought that this dreame was of the deuill as though hee had laboured thereby to hinder the death of christ and consequently our saluation but i rather thinke that it vvas occasioned by the thinges vvhich shee had heard before of christ or that it was immediatly from god as the dreames of pharao amp nabuchodonoser and serued for a further manifestation of christs innocencie here it may be asked whether we may regard our dreams now as pilates wife did or no answer wee haue the bookes of the olde and new testament to be our direction as esai saith to the law and to the testimonie they must be our rule and guide in these daies we must not looke to be taught by visions and dreames yet shall it not be amisse to obserue this caveat concerning dreames that by them we may gesse at the constitution of our body and often times at the sinnes whereunto we are inclined the last motiue which caused pilate to absolue christ was a speech of the iewes for they said that christ ought to die by their law because he saide he was the son of god and the text saith when pilate hearde that hee was afraide marke how a poore painym that knew not god word at the hearing of the name of the son of god is striken with feare no doubt he shall rise in iudgement against many among us that without all feare rend the name of god in peeces by swearing blaspheming cursed speaking but let all those that feare the lorde learne to tremble and be afraide at his blessed name thus much for the causes that moued pilate to absolue christ as also for the second part of christs arraignement namely his accusation now followes the third part which is his condemnation and that is twofolde the first by the ecclesiasticall assembly and councell of the iewes at ierusalem in the high priests hall before caiphas the tenour of his condemnation was this he hath blasphemed vvhat have we any more neede of witnesses he is worthy to die the cause why they say not he shall die but he is worthy to die is this the iewes had two iurisdictions the one ecclesiasticall the other civill both prescribed and distinctly executed by the commaundement of god till the time of the machabees in which both ioyntly togither came into the hads of the priests but afterward about the daies of herod the great the romane emperour tooke away both iurisdictions from the iewes and made their kingdome a province so as they could doe no more but apprehend accuse and imprison as doth appeare by the example of saul who gate letters from the high priest to damascus that if hee found any either man or woman that beleeued in christ hee might bring them bound to ierusalem and imprison them but kill or condemne they could not by the fact of this counsell we learne sundry points first that generall counsels and the pope himselfe sitting iudicially in his consistorie may erre if there were any visible church of god at that day upon the face of the whol world it was no doubt the church of the iewes for caiphas the high priest was a figure of christ the scribes and pharises sate in moses chaire and ierusalem is called by christ the holy citie mat amp yet for all this that which was foretold is now verified namely that the chiefe corner stone should be reiected of master builders for by the generall consent of the councell at ierusalem christ the head of the catholike church and the redeemer of mankind is accused of blasphemy and condemned as worthy of death wherefore it is a meere dotage of mans braine to avouch that the pope cannot possibly erre in giuing a definitive sentence in matters either of faith or manners neither can the church of rome pleade priviledge for ierusalem had as many prerogatiues as any people in the worlde coulde haue againe by this wee see there is no reason why wee should ascribe to any man or to oecumenicall counsels themselves absolute and soveraigne power to determine amp giue iudgement in matters of religion considering they are in danger to be ouertaken with notable slippes and errours and therefore the soueraigntie of iudgement is peculiar to the son of god who is the only doctour and law giuer of the church and he puts the same in execution in and by the written word as for the speech of the papistes calling the scriptures a dumb iudge it is little to be regarded for they are as it were the letter of the living sent from heauen to his church upon earth and therefore the scriptures speake as plainly and as sufficiently unto vs of all matters of faith as a man can speake unto his friend by letter so be it we haue the gift of discerning yet doe we not barre the church of god from all iudgement for the ministeriall power of giuing iudgement both publiquely and priuately is graunted of god and that is to determine and giue sentence of matters in question according to the worde as the lawyer giues iudgement not according as he wil but according to the tenour of the law thirdly we learne that personall succession is no unfallible marke of the true faith and of true pastours vnlesse withall be ioyned succession in the doctrine of the prophets and apostles for caiphas held his office by succession from aaron and yet in publike assembly condemned the messias spoken of by moses and the prophets therefore the succession of the bishops of rome from peter is of no moment vnlesse they can prooue that their religion is the religion of peter which they can neuer doe and thus much for christs first condemnation the second was by pontius pilate who sate in an other court as a civill iudge and the t no of his sentence was that the iewes should take him and crucifie him here we must consider the reasons that mooved pilate to determine thus the first was the impatience of the iewes he for his parte was loth to defile his hands with innocent blood but the iewes cryed his blood be upon us and on our children which according to their wish came upon them within fewe yeres after and so remaineth still unto this day by which we are taught to take heede of imprecations against our selues our children or servant or any other creatures for god heareth mens prayers two waies either in his mercy or in his wrath and anger if thou curse thy selfe or any other except thou turne unto the lorde by speedie repentance hee may heare thy prayer in his wrath and verifie thy curse upon thee to thy utter confusion the second reason that mooued pilate to condemne christ was because he feared man more then god for being deputy vnder tyberius caesar ouer the province of iudea for feare of loosing his office and of displeasing the iewes hee condemned christ after he had absolued him whereby wee see that it is a grieuous sinne to feare dust and ashes more then the living god and therefore s john saith that the fearefull shall have their portion in the burning lake that is such as are more afraid of man then of god and this sinne in pilate wanted not his iust towarde for not long after hee lost his deputy ship and cesars favour and fledde to vienna where liuing in banishment hee killed himselfe and thus god meetes with them that feare the creature more then the creatour that we may therefore avoid the heauie hand of god let us learne to feare god aboue all els we shall dishonour god and shame the religion which we professe the proper ende of christes condemnation set dovvne though not in pilats will yet in god eternall counsell was that he might be the cause of absolutio at the barre of god iustice unto all those whosoeuer they are which shall come to life eternall for we must still remember that whe christ was condemned by mortal iudges he stood in our place amp in him were all our sinnes condemned before god therefore to conclude this point if this were the end in the cousell of god to haue his owne son condened by pontius pilate a mortall iudge that we might not be condemned but absolved before god iudgement seat let us all labour to haue this absolution sealed up in our hearts by the testimony of god spirit for one day we must come to the bar of god iudgement and if we haue not an absolution by christs condemnation at pilates earthly barre let us looke for nothing els but the fearefull sentence of condemnation at the celestiall bar of god iustice to be uttered at the day of the last iudgement if a man should commit such an heynous offence as that he could no other way escape death but by the princes pardon he neither would nor could be at rest till by one meanes or other hee had obtained the same and had gotten it written and sealed which done hee would carrie it home locke it up safe and sound and many times looke upon it with great ioy amp gladnes well this is the case of euerie one of vs by nature we are rebells and traitours against god and haue by our sinnes deserued ten thousand death now our onely stay and refuge is that christ the son of god was condemned for vs and therfore in christ we must sue for pardon at god hands and neuer rest till we haue the assurance thereof sealed up in our hearts and consciences alwaies remembring that euer after we lead a new life and neuer commit the like sinnes against god any more it were a blessed thing if this would enter into our hearts but alas we are as dead in our sinnes as a deade carkasse is in the graue the ministers of god may teach this often unto us and we may also heare the same but satan doth so possesse mens hearts that they seldome or neuer beginne to beleeue or receiue it till it be too late euery one can say god is mercifull but that is not enough for christ being most righteous was condemned that thou being a wretched sinner mightest be saued and therefore thou must labour for thy selfe to haue some testimony of thine absolution by christs condemnation sealed up in thine owne conscience that thou maist more assuredly say god is and will be mercifull unto thee hauing spoken of the whole arraignement of christ and of his passion in generall now let vs proceede to the partes of the passion which are three christs execution his buriall amp his descending into hell this being withall remembred that these three partes are likewise three degrees of christs humiliation christes execution is that part of his passion which hee bare upon the crosse expressed in the words of the creede he was crucified and died in handling of it we must obserue fiue things i the person that suffered ii the place where he suffered iii the time when he suffered iiii the manner how he suffered v the excellencie of his passion for the first the person that suffered was christ the iust as peter saieth christ also hath once suffered for sinnes the iust for the vniust and againe christ iesus the iust saith s john is the reconciliation for our sinnes and in his execution wee shall haue manifest declarations of his righteousnesse and iustice consisting in two most worthie points first when he was upon the crosse and the souldiers were nailing his handes and feete thereunto and racking his bodie most cruelly he prayed father forgive them they know not what they doe these souldiers were by all likelihood the verie same that apprehended him and brought him before caiphas and from thence to pontius pilate and there platted a crowne of thornes and set it on his heade and buffetted him and spitefully intreated him as we haue heard and yet christ speaks no word of reuenge unto them but with all patience in the extremitie of their malice and iniurie he prayeth his father to forgive them hence we are taught that when iniuries are done unto us we ought to abstaine from all affection of reuenge and not so much as manifest the same either in word or deede it is indeed a hard lesson to learne and practise but we must indeauour to doe it amp not onely so but to be readie for evill to doe good yes even at that instant when other man are doing us wrong euen then i say we must be readie if it be possible to doe them good when as christes enemy were doing unto him al the trecherie they would euen then he performeth the worke of a mediatour and prayeth for them unto his father and seeketh their saluation againe whereas christ prayeth thus father forgive them we gather that the most principall thing of all that man ought to seeke after in this life is the forgiuenesse of sinnes some thinke that happinesse consisteth in honour some in wealth some in pleasure some in this some in that but indeed the thing which we should most labour for is reconciliation with god in christ that we may haue the free remission of all our sinnes yes this is blessednesse it selfe as david saith blessed is hee whose iniquitie is forgiven and whose sinne is covered here then behold the madnesse of most man in this world that either seeke for this blessing in the last place or not at all the seconde testimony of christs righteousnesse given in the middest of his passion was that he behelde his mother standing by and commended her to the custodie of john his disciple whereby he gaue an example of most holy obedience unto the fift commaundement which prescribeth honour to father and mother and this his fact sheweth that the obseruing of this commandement standeth not in outwarde shewe and reuerence onely but in a godly recompence in procuring unto parents all the good we can both concerning this and a better life it often falls out that children be as it were cains to father and mother some raile on them some fight with them others see them pine away and sterue and not relieue them but all dutifull children must here learne that as their parents haue done many duties unto them amp haue brought them up so they againe must in al reuerence performe obedience vnto them both in worde and deede and when occasion is offered relieve them yes in all that they can do good unto them againe in this wee may see what a wretched state is that which the church of rome calleth the state of perfection namely to liue a part from the company of man in fasting and praying all the daies of a mans life for hereby the bond of nature is broken and a man can not doe the duty vnto his parents which god law requireth and christ here himselfe practiseth nor the duties of a meber of christ which are to be done to the whole church and to the rest of the members thereof the place where christ suffered is called calvary or golgotha that is the place of dead mes skulls without the walls of ierusalem concerning the reason of this name man be of diverse opinions some say it was so called because adam was buried there amp that his skull beeing there found gaue the name to the place and this is the very opinion of some ancient divines that christ was there crucified where ada was buried but because it hath no certen ground i leaue it as uncerten others thinke it was called calvary because the iewes were wont to cary out the bones of dead man amp there to heape them togither as in times past the manner was in the vauts of sundry churches in this land and some others thinke it was called golgotha or calvary because theeues and murtherers and malefactours were there executed stoned burned whereby it came to passe that many skulles and bones of dead man were found there the time vvhen christ was executed was at the iewes passeover when not onely the iewes but also many proselytes of many country and nation were assembled and therefore this execution was not in a private corner but openly in the viewe of the worlde for as he was a sauiour not to the iewes onely but also to the gentiles so it was verie requisite that his death shoulde be publicke before all man both iewes and gentiles as for the houre of the day in which he suffered there is some difficultie in the euangelists for s john saith that hee was condemned about the sixt houre of the day and s marke saieth he was crucified the third houre hence it may be demaunded how both these can stand togither answer howsoeuer the iewes naturall day began at evening yet the artificiall day began at sun rising and ended at sun setting and it was divided two waies first into twelue partes called twelue houres whether the daies were longer or shorter secondly into foure partes or quarters and euery part contained three houres as from the first houre to the third was one part called morning from the third houre to the sixt an other part called the sixt houre from the sixt houre to the ninth the third part called the ninth houre and from the ninth houre to the twelfth the fourth part called euening nowe when s john saieth christ was condemned about the sixt houre it must be understood of the second quarter of the day called the sixt houre and whereas s marke saith he was crucified the thirde houre of the day he speakes of the less houres twelue whereof made the vvhole day and thus they both agree for the third houre of the day and the beginning of the quarter followe ech other immediatly againe it may be answered that christ was condened at six of the clock after the roman account which begins the day at midnight amp crucified at which is of the clock in the morning with us aftet the iewes accout who begin their artificiall day as i said at the sun rising the fourth amp last point is the order amp whole proceeding of christs executio vvhich may be reduced to heads the first his going to execution the his crucifying the his death the the consequents of his death againe in his going to execution we may consider many pointes the first that he is brought out of hierusalem as a malefactour for the olde and ancient custome of the ievves was to put those whome they iudged to be notorious offenders to death without heir tentes when they wandred in the wildernesse and without the walles of hierusalem lest they should any way be defiled with their blood and this fell out by the speciall providence of god that that might be fulfilled in christ which was prefigured in the sacrifices of the old testament when the body of beast were not eaten of the priests but burnt without the campe therfore saith the h ghost even iesus that he might sanctifie the people with his owne blood suffered without the gates hence may all christians learne to know their owne estate and condition first in this world they must looke to be accounted the offscouring of the earth and the filth of the worlde as the apostle saith and vvee must all prepare our selues to beare this estate they that vvill be god children must not looke to be better accepted of in the vvorld then christ vvas secondly by this every one of us must learne to be content to use this vvorld as straungers amp pilgrimes being every day and houre readie to leave the same for if christ the son of god himselfe vvas brought out of ierusalem as not beeing vvorthy to haue his abode there then must euery christian man looke much more for the like extremitie and therefore it is not good for us to haue our hearts tyed to the vvorlde amp to seeke alvvaies to be approoued of the same for that argueth that vve are not like to christ but vve must rather do as poore pilgrimes in strange cuntries amp that is only to look for safe conduct through the miseries in this vvorlde hauing in the meane season our hearts vvills amp affections set on the kingdome vvhich is in heauen the second thing is that christ vvas made to beare his ovvne crosse for so it seemes the maner of the romanes was to deale vvith malefactours and this must put vs in mind of that notable lesson vvhich chtist himselfe taught his disciples namely that if any man vvill be his disciple he must denie himselfe take up his ovvne crosse daily and follow him where by the crosse we must vnderstand that portion of affliction which god hath alotted to euery one of his children for there is no child of god to whome hee hath not measured out as it were some bitter cup of misery in this life and therfore paul saith now reioyce i in my suffering for you amp fulfill the rest of the sufferings of christ in my flesh by christes sufferings he meaneth not the passion of christ but the sufferings of the bodie of christ that is the church whereof christ is the head moreouer wee must suffer as he did amp that daily because as one day followeth another so one crosse comes in the necke of another and whereas christ beares the crosse that was laide on him by the hands of the soldiers it must teach us not to pull crosses upon ou selues but waite till god lay them on vs and then we must willingly bend our shoulders stoope downe and take them up whether they be in body or in soule and that every day if it be god will so long as we live and by this shall we most notably resemble our saviour christ thirdly when christ had carried his crosse so long till he coulde carrie it no longer by reason of the faintnesse of his bodie which came by buffets whippings and manifold other iniuries then the souldiers meeting with one simon of cyrene a stranger made him to beare the crosse where we are put in mind that if we faint in the way and be wearied with the burthen of our afflictions god will give good issue and send as it were some simon of cyrene to help us and to be our comforter the fourth points is that when christ was carrying his owne crosse and was now passing on tovvards golgotha certaine woman mette him and pitying his case wept for him but christ answered them and said daughters of ierusalem weep not for me but for your selves amp your childre ampc by this wee are first of all taught to pitie the state of those that be in affliction and miserie especially those that be the children of god as the apostle exhorteth vs saying remember them that are in bonds as though you vvere bound with them and them that are in affliction as though you were afflicted with them in this land by god especiall blessing wee haue enioyed the gospell of christ with peace a long time whereas other cuntries amp churches are in great distresse some wallow in palpable ignorance amp superstition others haue libertie to enioy the gospell and want teachers and some haue both the word amp teachers and yet want peace and are in continuall persecution now when we that haue the gospell with peace do heare of these miseries in our neighbour churches we ought to be mooued with compassion towardes them as though we our selues were in the same afflictions secondly whereas christ saith weepe not for me but for your selves he doth teach vs to take occasion by other mens miseries to bewaile our owne estate to turne our worldly griefes into godly sorow for our sinnes whereby wee doe rather weepe for our offences then for our friends although euen that may also be done in a godly manner when a man by bleeding at the nose is brought into daunger of his life the phisition lets him blood in an other place as in the arme and turnes the course of the blood an other way to saue his life and so must we turne our worldly sorows for losse of goods or friends to a godly sorrow for our offences against god for as s paul saith godly sorrow causeth repentance unto salvatio not to be repented of but worldly sorow causeth death the fift point is that when christ was brought to the place of execution they gaue him vineger to drinke mingled with mirrhe and gall some say it was to intoxicate his braine and to take away his senses and memorie which if it were true we may here behold in these iewes a most wicked part that at the point of death when they were to take away his life they had no care of his soule for this is a dutie to be observed of all magistrates that whe they are to execute malefactours they must haue an especiall care of the salvation of their soules but some thinke rather that it was to shorten and end his torments quickely some of vs may peradventure thinke hardly of the iewes for giving this bitter potio to christ at the time of his death but the same thing doth every sinner that repeteth not for whensoever we sin we do as much as teper a cup of gal or the poiso of aspes amp as it vvere giue it to god to drink for so god him selfe copareth the sin of the vvicked iewes to poison saying their vine is of the vine of sodom amp of the vines of gomorra their grapes are grapes of gal their clusters be bitter their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruell gall of aspes and for this cause wee ought to thinke as hardly of our selues as of the iewes because so oft as we comit any offence against god we do as much as mingle ranke poison amp bring it to christ to drinke now whe this cup was given him he tasted of it but drank not because hee was willing to suffer all things that his father had appointed him to suffer on the crosse without any shortening or lessening of his paine thus vve see in vvhat maner christ vvas brought forth to the place of execution now followeth his crucifying christ in the providence of god was to be crucified for two causes one that the figures of the olde testament might be accomplished and verified for the heave offer lifted up and shaked from the right hand to the left and the brasen serpent erected vpon a pole in the wildernes prefigured the exalting of christ upon the crosse the seconde that wee might in conscience be resolved that christ became under the lawe amp suffered the curse therof for us amp bare in his ovvne bodie and soule the extremitie of the vvrath of god for our offences and though other kinds of punishments were notes of the curse of god as stoning and such like yet vvas the death of the crosse in speciall maner aboue the rest accursed not by the nature of the punishment not by the opinions of man not by the civill lavves of cuntries and kingdoms but by the vertue of a particular commandement of god foreseeing what manner of death christ our redeemer should die and hereupon among the ievves in all ages this kind of punishment hath bene branded with speciall ignominie as paul signifieth vvhen hee saieth hee abased him selfe to the death even to the death of the crosse amp it hath beene allotted as a most grievous punishment to most notorious malefactours if it be said that the repentant theefe upon the crosse died the same death vvith christ and yet vvas not accursed the answere is that in regard of his offences he deserued the curse and was actually accursed and the signe of this was the death which he suffered and that in his owne confession but because hee repented his sinnes were pardoned and the curse removed it may further be said that crucifying was not knowen in moses daies and therefore not accursed by any speciall commandement of god in deuteronomy ans moses indeed speakes nothing in particular of crucifying yet neverthelesse he doth include the same under the generall for if euery one which hangs upon a tree be accursed then hee also which is crucified for crucifying is a particular kinde of hanging on the tree lastly it may be alleadged that christ in his death coulde not be accursed by the lawe of moses because he was no malefactour ans though in regard of himselfe he was no sinner yet as he was our suretie he became sinne for vs and consequently the curse of the law for vs in that the curse every way due unto us by imputation and application was made his furthermore christ was crucified not after the maner of the iewes who used to hang malefactors upon a tree binding them thereto with cords amp that whe they were dead but after the usuall maner of the romans his bodie being partly nailed to the crosse amp partly in the nailing extremely racked otherwise i see not but that a man might remaine many daies togither alive upo the crosse and here we haue occasion to remeber that the papists who are so deuout amp zelous towards crucifixes are far deceived in the making of the for first of all the crosse was made of pieces of wood one fastned upright in the ground to which the bodie and back leaned the second fastened towardes the toppe of the first overthwart to which the hands were nailed the thirde fastned towards the bottome of the first on which the feete vvere set and nailed vvhereas contrarivvise popish caruers amp painters fasten both the feet of christ to the first secodly the feete of christ vvere nailed asunder vvith tvvo distinct nailes amp not nailed one upon another with one naile alone as papists imagine and that to the verie body of the crosse for then the soldiers could not haue broken both the leggs of the thieves but only the outmost let vs now come to the vse which may be made of the crucifying of christ first of all here we learne with bitternes to bewaile our sinnes for christ was thus cruelly nayled on the crosse and there suffered the whole wrath of god not for any offence that euer he committed but beeing our pledge and suretie vnto god he suffered all for vs and therefore iust cause haue we to mourne for all our offences which brought our sauiour christ to this low estate if a man should be so farre in debt that he could not be freed vnlesse the suretie should be cast into prison for his sake nay which is more be cruelly put to death for his debt it would make him at his wits ende and his very heart to bleede and so is the case with vs by reason of our sins we are god debters ye bankrupts before him yet haue we gotten a good suretie euen the son of god himselfe who to recouer vs to our former libertie was crucifyed for the discharge of our debt and therefore good cause haue we to bewaile our estate euery day as by the prophet it is said they shall looke on him whome they haue pierced they shall lament for him as one mourneth for his owne son they shall be sorrie for him as one is sorrie for his first borne looke as the blood followed the nailes that were striken through the blessed hands and feete of christ so should the meditation of the crosse and passion of our redeemer be as it were nayles and speares to pierce vs that our hearts might bleed for our sinnes and we are not to thinke more hardly of the iewes for crucifying him then of our selues because our sinnes they also crucifyed him these are the very nayles which pierce his hands and feete and these are the speares which pierce through his side for the losse of a litle worldly pelfe oh how are we grieued but seeing our transgressions are the weapons whereby the son of god was crucifyed let vs i say it againe and againe learne to be grieued for them aboue al things amp with bleeding and melting hearts bowe and buckle vnder them as vnder the crosse secondly christ saith of himselfe as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernes so must the son of man be lifted vp the comparison is excellent and worthie the marking in the wildernes of arabia the people of israel rebelled against god and thereupon he sent fierie serpents among them which stong many of them to death now when they repented moses was commanded to make a brasen serpent and to set it vpon a pole that as many as were stong might looke vnto it and recouer and if they could but cast a glaunce of the eye on the brasen serpent when they were stong eue to death they were restored to health amp life now euery man that liueth is in the same case with the israelits satan hath stong vs at the heart amp giuen vs many a deadly wound if we could feele it and christ who was figured by the brasen serpent was likewise exalted on the crosse to coferre righteousnes amp life eternal to euery one of vs therfore if we will escape eternal death we must renouce our selues amp lift vp the eyes of our faith to christ crucified amp pray for the pardon of our sinnes amp then shall our hearts amp consciences be healed of the wounds amp gripes of the devil amp vntill such time as we haue grace to do this we shall neuer be cured but stil lie wounded with the stings of satan amp bleeding to death euen at the very heart although we feele no paine or griefe at all but some may aske how any man can see him crucifyed now after his death answer wheresoeuer the word of god is preached there christ is crucifyed as paul saith oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth to whome before iesus christ was described in your sight and among you crucifyed meaning that he was liuely preached among them we neede not to goe to wooden crosses or to golden crucifixes to seek for him but where the gospell is preached thither must wee go amp there lift vp our eyes of faith to christ as he is reuealed vnto vs in the word resting on him and his merits with all our hearts and with a godly sorow confesse and bewaile our sinnes crauing at his hands mercie and pardon for the same for till such time as we doe this we are grieuously stong by satan and are euery moment euen at death dore and if we can thus behold christ by faith the benefites which comes hereby shall be great for as paul saith the old man that is the corruption of our nature and the bodie of sinne that raigneth in vs shall be crucified with him for when christ was nayled on the crosse all our sinnes were laide vpon him therefore if thou doest vnfainedly beleeue all thy sinnes are crucified with him and the corruption of thy nature languisheth and dieth as he languished and died vpon the crosse thirdly we must learne to imitate christ as he suffered himselfe to be nailed to the crosse for our sinnes so answearably must euery one of vs learne to crucifie our flesh and the corruption of our nature and the wickednesse of our owne heart as paul saith they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof and this we shall doe if for our sinnes past we doe waile and mourne with bitternes and preuent the sinnes to come into whi h we may fall by reason of the corruption of our natures by vsing all good meanes as praier and fasting and the word of god preached and by flying all occasions of offence we are not to destroy our body or to kill our selues but to kill and crucifie sinne that liueth in vs and to mortifie the corruption of our nature that rebels against the spirit christianitie stands not in this to heare the word of god amp outwardly to professe the same amp in the meane season stil to liue in our sinnes amp to pamper our owne rebellious flesh but it teacheth vs alwaies to haue in readinesse some speare or other to wound sinne amp the sword of the spirit to cut down corruption in vs that thereby we may shew our selues to be liuely followers of christ indeede fourthly by this we may learn that the wrath of god against sinne is woderful great because his own son bearing our person amp being in our place was not onely crucified amp racked most cruelly but also bare the whole wrath of god in his soule and therfore we must leaue off to make so litle account of sinne as commonly we doe fiftly wheras the person crucified was the son of god it sheweth that the loue of god which he bare vnto vs in our redemption is endlesse like a sea without banke or bottome it can not be searched into amp if we shal not acknowledge it to be so our condemnation will be the greater sixtly in this that christ bare the curse of the law vpon the crosse we learne that those that be the children of god when they suffer any iudgement crosse or calamitie either in bodie or in minde or both doe not beare them as the curses of god but as the chastisements of a louing father for it doth not stande with the iustice of god to punish one fault twise and therefore when any man that putteth his whole confidence in god shall either in his owne person in his good name or in his goods feele the heauie hand of god god doth not as a iudge curse him but as a father correct him here then is condemned the opinion of the church of rome which hold that we by our suffrings doe in some part satisfie the iustice of god but this can not stand because christ did make a perfect satisfaction to the iustice of his father for all punishment and therefore satisfaction to god made by man for temporall punishment is needelesse and much derogates from christs passion in the crucifying of christ two things specially must be considered the manner of the doing of it and his continuance aliue vpon the crosse touching the manner the spirite of god hath noted two things the first that christ was crucifyed betweene two theeues the one vpon his left hand the other vpon his right in which action is verified the saying of the prophet esay he was numbred among the wicked and the iewes for their parts doe hereby testifie that they esteemed him to be not some common wicked man but euen the captaine and ringleader of all theeues amp malefactours whatsoeuer nowe whereas christ standing vpon the crosse in our roome and stead is reputed the head and prince of all sinners it serueth to teach euery one of vs that beleeue in him to iudge our selues most vile and miserable sinners and to say of our selues with paul that we are the chiefe of all sinners the second thing is that christ was crucified naked because he was stripped of his garments by the souldiers when he was to be crucified the causes why he suffered naked are these first adam by his fall brought vpon all mankinde death both of bodie and soule and also the curses of god which befall man in this life among which this was one that the nakednes of the bodie should be ignominious and hereupon when adam had sinned amp saw himselfe naked he fled fro the presence of god amp hid himselfe eue for very shame christ therfore was stripped of his garments and suffered naked that he might beare all the punishment and ignominie that was due vnto man for sinne secondly this came to passe by the goodnes of god that we might haue a remedie for our spirituall nakednes which is when a man hath his sinnes lying open before god eyes and by reason thereof hee himselfe lieth open to all god iudgements hereof the angel speaketh to the church of laodicea saying thou saiest j am rich and encreased with goods and haue neede of nothing and knowest not how thou article wretched miserable blinde and naked so when the israelites had committed idolatry by the golden calfe moses telleth them that they were naked not onely because they had spoiled themselues of their earings but especially because they were destitute of god fauour and lay open and naked vnto all his iudgements for that sinne and salomon saith where there is no vision there the people are made naked that is their sinnes lie open before god and by reason thereof they themselues are subiect to his wrath and indignation now christ was crucified naked that he might take away from vs this spirituall nakednesse and also giue vnto vs meete garments to cloath vs withall in the presence of god called white rayment as christ saith i counsell thee to buie of me white rayment that thou maist be cloathed and that thy filthie nakednes doe not appeare and long white robes dipped in the blood of the lambe which serue to hide the nakednes of our soules vvhat these garments are the apostle sheweth when he saith all that are baptized into christ haue put on christ and put on the new man which after god is created in righteoosnes and true holines our nakednes maketh vs more vile in the sight of god then the most loathsome creature that is can be vnto vs vntill we haue put on the righteousnes of christ to couer the deformitie of our soules that we may appeare holy and without spot before god thirdly paul saith we know if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed we haue a building giuen of god ampc for therefore we sigh desiring to be cloathed with our house which is from heauen because if we be cloathed we shall not be found naked where it is like that the apostle alludeth to the nakednes of adam after his fall and therefore giueth vs another reason why christ was crucified naked namely that after this life he might cloath all his members with eternall glorie if this be so that a part of our reioycing stands in the glorious nakednes of christ crucified there is no reason why we should be puffed vp with the vanitie of our apparell it should rather be an occasion to make vs ashamed then to make vs proud the thiefe may as well bragge of the brand in his hand or of the fetters on his heeles as we may of our attire because it is but the couering of our shame and therfore should put vs in mind of our sinne amp shamful nakednes the abode of christ vpon the crosse was about the space of sixe houres for the death of the crosse was no suddaine but a producta mors mark lingring death and in this space of time there fell out five notable euents the first that the souldiers hauing stripped christ of his garments deuided them into foure parts and cast lotts for his coat because it was woven without seame and by this appeares the great loue of christ to man who was not onely content to suffer but also to loose all that euer he had euen to the garments on his backe to redeeme vs teaching vs answeerably that if it please god to call vs to any triall hereafter we must be content to part with all for his sake that we may winne him againe in these souldiers we may behold a picture of this world when they had nayled christ to the crosse they will not loose so much as his garments but they come and deuide them and cast lotts for them as for christ himselfe the sauiour and redeemer of mankinde they regard him not and thus fareth the world it is a hard thing to finde a man to accept of christ because he is christ his redeemer but when gaines comes by christ then he is welcome esau that esteemed nothing of his fathers blessing made great account of his brothers pottage the gaderenes made more account of their swine then of christ for when they heard that they were drowned they beg him to depart out of their coasts nay so bad is this age that such as will be taken to be the speciall members of christ doe not onely with the souldiers strippe christ of his garments but more then this they bereaue him of his natures and offices the church of rome by their transsubstantiation strippe him of his manhoode and by making other priests after the same order with him which doe properly forgiue sinnes strippe him of his priesthoode and of his kingly office by ioyning with him a vicar on earth and head of the catholicke church and that in his presence whereas all debitishippes and commissions cease in the presence of the principall and when they haue done all this then they further loade him with a nomber of a beggarly ceremonies and so doe nothing else but make a fictitium christum feighned christ in steade of the true and alone messias the second euent was that christ was mocked of all sorts of man first they set vp the cause written why he was crucified namely this is the king of the ievves then the people that passed by reuiled him wagging their heads at him and said thou that destroiest the temple and buildest it in three daies saue thy selfe ampc likewise the high priests mocking him with the scribes and pharisies and the elders said he saued others let him safe himselfe the same also did one of the theeues that was crucified with him cast in his teeth behold here the wonderfull strange dealing of the iewes they see an innocent man thus pitifully and grieuously racked and nayled on the crosse and his bloode distilling downe from handes and feete and yet are they without all pitie and compassion and doe make but a mocke and a skoffe at him and in this we may plainly see howe daungerous and fearefull their case is who are wholly giuen vp to the hardnes of their owne hearts and we are further admonished to take heede how we giue our selues to iesting or mocking of others and if any thinke it to be a light sinne let them consider what befell the iewes for mocking christ the hand of god was vpon them within a while after and so remaineth to this day little children wickedly brought vp when they sawe elisha the man of god comming they mocked him and said come vp thou bald pate come vp thou bald pate but elisha looked backe on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and two wilde beares came out of the forrest and tare in pieces two and fourtie of the iulian once a christian emperour but after an apostata did nothing els but mocke christ and his gospell amp made iests of sundrie places of scripture but beeing in fight against the persians was wouded with a dart no man knows how and died scoffing and blaspheming and such like are the iudgements of god which befall mockers and skorners let vs therefore in the feare of god learne to eschew and auoide this sinne furthermore if we shall indifferently consider all the mockes and skornings of the iewes we shal finde that they cannot truly conuince him of the least sinne which serueth to cleare christ and to prooue that he was a most innocent man in whose waies was no wickednes and in whose mouth was found no guile and therefore he was most fitte to stand in our roome and suffer for vs which were most vile and sinnefull and here by the way a question offereth it selfe to be skanned saint matthew saith the theeues which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth which the scribes and pharisies did saint luke saith that one of the theeues mocked him nowe it may be demaunded how both these can be true answer some reconcile the places thus that the scripture speaking generally of any thing by a figure doth attribute that to the whole which is proper to some part onely and so here doth ascribe that to both the theeues which agreeth but to one others answer it thus that at the first both of the euill doers did mocke christ and of that time speaketh matthew but afterward one of them was miraculously conuerted then the other alone mocked him amp of that time spake s luke and this i rather take to be the truth but what was the behauiour of christ when he is thus laden with reproch in wonderfull patience he replies not but puts vp all in silence where we may note that when a man shall aile on vs wrongfully we must not returne rebuke for rebuke nor taunt for taunt but we must either be silent or else speake no more then shall serue for our iust defence this was the practise of the israelites by the appointment of hezekias when rab akah reuiled the iewes and blasphemed the name of god the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandement was answer him not so hannah beeing troulbed in minde praied vnto the lord and hely marked her mouth for shee spake in her heart and her lippes did mooue onely but her voice was not heard therefore hely thought shee had beene drunken and saide how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy drukennesse from thee such a speach would haue mooued many one to very hard words but she said nay my lord but i am a woman troubled in spirit i haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke but haue powred out my soule before the lord this is a hard lesson for man to learne but we must endeauour our selues to practise it if we will be followers of christ and ouercome euill with good the third thing that fell out in the time of christs crucifying was the pitifull complaint in which he cried with a loud voice eli eli lamasabact hani that is my god my god why hast thou forsaken me in the opening of this complaint many points must be skanned the first is what was the cause that mooued christ to complaine answer it was not any impatience or discontentation of minde or any dispaire or any dissembling as some would haue it but it was an apprehension and a feeling of the whole wrath of god which seazed vpon him both in bodie and soule the second what was the thing wherof he doth complain answer that he is forsaken of god the father and from this point ariseth an other question howe christ beeing god can be forsaken of god for the father the son and the holy ghost are all three but one and the same god answer by god we must vnderstand god the father the first person according to the common rule when god is compared with the son or holy ghost then the father is ment by the this title god as in this place not that the father is more god then the son for in dignitie all the three persos are equal but they are distinguished in order only amp the father is first and againe whereas christ complaineth that he was forsaken it must be vnderstood in regard of his humane nature not of his godhead and christs manhoode was forsaken not that his godhead and manhoode were seuered for they were euer ioyned togither fro the first moment of the incarnation but the godhead of christ and so the godhead of the father did not shew forth his power in the manhoode but did as it were lie asleepe for a time that the manhood might suffer when a man sleepeth the soule is not seuered from the bodie but lieth as it were dead and exerciseth not it selfe euen so the godhead lay still and did not manifest his power in the manhoode and thus the manhood seemed to be forsaken the third point is the manner of this complaint my god my god saith he these words are words of faith i say not of iustifying faith wherof christ stood not in need but he had such a faith or hope wherby he did put his cofidece in god the last words why hast thou forsake me seem at the first to be words of distrust how then will some say can these words stand with the former for faith amp distrust are flat contraries answer christ did not vtter any speach of distrust but only make his mone amp coplaint by reason of the greatnes of his punishment amp yet still relied himselfe on the assistance of his father hence we learne first that religion doth not stand in feeling but in faith which faith we must haue in christ though we haue no feeling at all for god oftentimes doth withdraw his grace amp fauour fro his children that he may teach the to beleeue in his mercie in christ then when they feele nothing lesse then his mercie and faith amp feeling can not alwaies stand togither because faith is a subsisting of things which are not seene and the ground of things hoped for and we must liue by faith and not by feeling though feeling of god mercie be a good thing yet god doth not alwaies vouchsafe to giue it vnto his children and therefore in the extremitie of afflictions and temptations we must alwaies trust and relie on god by faith in christ as christ himselfe doth when he is as it were plunged into the sea of the wrath of god secondly here we may see howe god dealeth with his children for christ in the sense and feeling of his humane nature was forsaken yet had he sure trust and confidence in god that caused him to say my god my god god will oftentimes cast his deare children into huge gulfs of woe and miserie where they shall see neither banke nor bottome nor any way to get out yet man in this case must not despaire but remember still that that which befell christ the head doth also befall his members christ himselfe at his death did beare the wrath of god in such measure as that in the sense and feeling of his humane nature he was forsaken yet in all this he was the son of god and had the spirit of his father crying my god my god and therefore though we be wonderfully afflicted either in bodie or in mind so as we haue no sense or feeling of god mercie at all yet we must not despaire and thinke that we are cast awaies but still labour to trust and relie on god in christ amp build vpon this that we are his children though we feele nothing but his wrath vpon vs against mercie cleauing to his mercie this was dauids practise in the day of trouble saith he i sought the lord my sore ranne and ceased not in the night my soule refused comfort i did thinke vpon god and was troubled my soule was full of anguish and so continueth saying will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour hath god forgotten to be mercifull but in the ende he recouereth himselfe out of this gulfe of temptation saying yet i remember the yeares of the right hand of the most high i remember the works of the lord certenly i remember the wonders of old wherefore this practise of christ in his passion must then be remembred of vs all when god shall humble vs either in bodie or soule or both the fourth thing which fell out when christ was on the crosse was this after christ knew that all things were performed amp that the scriptures were fulfilled he said i thirst and then there standing a vessell full of vineger one ranne and filled a sponge therewith and put it about an hyssope stalke and put it to his mouth which when he had receiued he said it is finished the points here to be considered are foure the first that christ thirsteth and we must know that this thirst was a part of his passion and indeede it was no small paine as we may see by this when sisera was ouercome by israel and had fled from his enemy to iaels tent he called for a little water to drinke being more troubled with thirst then with the feare of death at the hand of his enemy and indeede thirst was as grieuous to man in the east countrey as any torment else and hereupon sampson was more grieued with thirst then with feare of many thousand philistims againe whereas christ complaines that he thirsteth it was not for his owne sake but for our of ences and therefore answearably we must thirst after christ and his benefits as the dry and thirstie land where no water is doth after raine and as the hart brayeth after the river of water so must we say with dauid my soule panteth after thee o lord and the benefits of thy death the second that a sponge full of vineger tied vpon an hyssope stalke was reached to christ vpon the crosse now it may be demaunded how this could be considering the stalke of the hyssope is not past a foote long answer as the tree of mustard seede with the iewes is farre greater and taller then with vs in so much that the birds of heauen build their nests in it so it may be that hyssope groweth much longer in those country then with vs or as i take it rather the hyssope stalke was put vpon a reede and by that meanes the sponge was put vp to the mouth of christ the third point is that christ drinketh the vineger offered but when not before all things were finished that were to be done on the crosse and by this he shewes his exceeding care for our saluation he laide aside all thinges that would turne to his owne ease that he might fully worke our redemption and fulfill the will of his father who sent him into the world for that ende the like care must euery one of vs haue to walke dutifully and as it were to goe with thorough stitch in our particular callings that god may be glorified by vs when abrahams servant came to bethuel to get a wife for isaac me t was set before him but he said i will not eate before i haue said my message so likewise we must first see god glorie procured in our affaires and then in the second place if commoditie or praise redound to vs we must afterward take it the last point is that when christ had drunke the vineger he said it is finished vvhich words may haue a double sense one that such things as were figured by the sacrifices of the old testament are accomplished the other that now vpon the crosse he had finished his satisfaction to the iustice of his father for mans sinne and this of the twaine i rather thinke to be his meaning if it be said that the buriall and resurrection and ascension of christ ampc which are very necessarie to mans redemption were not yet begunne the answer is that the works of christs priesthoode which follow his death serue not to make any satisfaction to god iustice for sinne but onely to confirme or applie it after it is made and accomplished on the crosse and if this be so that christ in his owne person accomplished the worke of redemption and made a full and perfect satisfaction for vs as these words import it is finished then humane satisfactions to god iustice for sinne are altogether superfluous the fifth euent that fell out when christ was vpon the crosse was that he cryed with a loud voice and said father into thy handes i lay downe my spirite that is i commende my soule as being the most pretious thing which i haue in this worlde into thy custodie who article a most faithfull keeper therof these words are taken by christ out of the psalmes for when dauid was in daunger of his life by reason of saul and had no friend to trust he makes choice of god to be his keeper and said into thy hands o lord doe j commend my spirite nowe our sauiour christ beeing in the like distresse both by reason of the iewes who euery way sought his finall destruction and confusion and especially because he felt the full wrath of god seazing vpon him doth make choice of davids words and applie them to himselfe in his distresse and by his example we are taught not onely to read the generall historie of the bible but also to obserue the things commaunded and forbidden and to applie the same vnto our selues and to our particular estates and dealings whatsoeuer thus the prophet dauid saith in the rolle of the booke it is written of me that i should doe thy will o my god howe can this be for no part of scripture penned before the daies of dauid saith thus of him true indeede but as i take it dauids meaning is that he read the booke of the lawe and found generall precepts and commaundements giuen to kings and princes that they should keepe all the ordinances and commaundements of god which he beeing a king applies particularly to his owne person and thereupon saith in the volume of the booke it is written of me ampc and this dutie is well practised by the people of god at this day for the psalmes of dauid were penned according to the estate of the church in his time and in these daies the church of god doth sing the same with the same spirite that dauid did and doth applie them to their seuerall estates and conditions now in that christ commends his soule into the hands of his father he doth it to testifie that he died not by constraint but willingly and by his owne practise he doeth teach vs to doe the like namely to giue vp our owne soules into the hands of god and because this dutie is of some difficultie we must obserue three motiues or preparatiues which may induce vs to the better doing of it the first is to consider that god the father of christ is the creator of our soules and therefore he is called the father of spirits and if he be a creator of them then is he also a faithfull preseruer of them for sure it is that god will preserue his own workmanship who is or ca be so careful for the ornament and preseruation of any worke as the crafts master and shall not god be more carefull then man wherefore saint peter exhorteth vs to commit our soules vnto god as vnto a faithfull creator the second motiue is this we must looke to be resolued in our consciences that god the father of christ is our father euery man for himselfe must labour to haue the assurance of the pardon of his owne sinnes and that the corruption of his soule be washed away in the blood of christ that he may say i am iustified sanctified and adopted by christ and when any man can say thus he shall be most desirous and willing to commit his soule into the hands of god this was the reason which mooued christ to lay downe his soule into the handes of god because he is his father the third motiue or preparatiue is a continuall experience and obseruation of god loue and fauour towardes vs in keeping and preseruing him as appeares by dauids example into thy handes saith he i commit my soule for thou hast redeemed me o thou god of truth the time when wee are specially to commende our soules into the hande of god is first of all the time of any affliction or daunger this was the time when dauid commended his soule into the handes of god in the psalme before named vvee knowe that in any common daunger or perill as the sacking of a citie or burning of an house if a man haue any pretious iewell therein he will first fetch that out and make choice of a faithfull friend to whose custodie he will commit the same euen so in common perils and daungers we must alwaies remember to commit our soules as a most pretious iewell into the hands of god who is a faithfull creator an other more speciall and necessarie time of practising this dutie is the houre of death as here christ doth and steuen who when the iewes stoned him to death called on god and saide lord iesus receiue my spirit and as this dutie is very requisite and necessarie at all times so most especially in the houre of death because the daunger is great by reason that sathan will then chiefly assault vs and the guilt of sinne will especially then wounde the conscience lastly at all times we must commit our soules into god hands for though we be not alwaies in affliction yet we are alwaies in great daunger and when a man lieth downe to rest he knoweth not whether he shall rise againe or no and when he riseth he knoweth not whether he shall lie downe againe yes at this very houre we know not what will befall the next and great are the comforts which arise by the practise of this dutie when dauid was in great daunger of his life and his owne people would haue stoned him because their hearts were vexed for their sonnes and daughters which the amalekites had taken it is said he comforted himselfe in the lord his god and the practise of paul in this case is most excellent for the which cause saith he j suffer those things but i am not ashamed for i know whome i haue beleeued and i am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which i haue committed vnto him against that day this worthie servant of god had committed his life and soule into god hand and therefore he saith in all my sufferings i am not ashamed where we may see that if a man haue grace in his life time to commit his soule into god hand it will make him bold euen at the point of death and this must be a motiue to cause euery man euery day and houre to lay downe his soule into the hands of god although by the course of nature he may liue twentie yeares longer but howsoeuer this dutie be both necessarie and comfortable yet few there be that practise the same man that haue children are very carefull and diligent to bring them vp vnder some mans tuition and if they haue cattell sheepe or oxen they prouide keepers to tend them but in the meane season for their owne soules they haue no care they may sinke or swimme or doe what they will this sheweth the wonderfull blindnes or rather madnesse of man in the world that haue more care for their cattell then for their owne soules but as christ hath taught vs by his example so let euery one of vs in the feare of god learne to commit our soules into the hande of god againe in that christ laies downe his owne soule and withall the soules of all the faithfull into the handes of the father we further learne three things the first that the soule of man doth not vanish avvay as the soules of beastes and other creatures there is great difference betvveene them for vvhen the beast dieth his soule dieth also but the soule of man is immortall the consideration wherof must mooue euery man aboue al things in this vvorld to be carefull for his soule if it vvere to vanish avvay at the day of death as the soule of beastes doe the neglect thereof vvere no great matter but seeing it must liue for ever either in eternall ioy or els in endlesse paines and torments it standes vs upon euery man for himselfe so to provide for his soule in this life that at the day of death when it shall depart from his bodie it may live in eternall ioy and happinesse the second that there is an especiall and particular prouidence of god because the particular soule of christ is committed into the hands of his father and so answerably the soules of euery one of the faithfull are the thirde that euerie one which beleeues him selfe to be a member of christ must be willing to die vvhen god shall call him thereunto for vvhen vvee die in christ the bodie is but laide asleepe and the soule is receiued into the handes of a most loving god and mercifull father as the soule of christ was lastly vvhereas christ surrendring his soule into his fathers hands calles it a spirite we note that the soule of man is a spirit that is a spirituall invisible simple essence without coposition created as the angels of god are the question vvhether the soule of a child come from the soule of the parents as the body doth come from their body may easily bee resolued for the soule of man beeing a spirite can not beget another spirit as the angels being spirituall doe not beget angels for one spirit begetteth not another nay vvhich is more one simple element begetteth not another as the vvater begetteth not water nor aire begetteth aire and therefore much lesse can one soule beget an other againe if the soule of the child come from the soule of the parentes then there is a propagation of the whole soul of the parent or of some part thereof if it be said that the whole soule of the parents be propagated then the parents should want their owne soules and could not liue if it be said that a part of the parents soule is propagated i answer that the soule being a spirit or a simple substance can not be parted and therfore it is the safest to conclude that the bodie indeed is of the bodie of the parents amp that the soule of man while the bodie is in making is created of nothing and for this verie cause god is called the father of spirites thus much of the crucifying of christ now followeth his death for hauing laid downe his soule into the handes of his father the holy ghost saith he gave vp the ghost to giue us to understand that his death was no fantasticall but a reall death in that his bodie and soule were severed as truly as when any of vs die in treating of christes death we must consider many pointes the first that it was needfull that hee should die and that for tvvo causes first to satisfie god iustice for sinne is so odious a thing in god ight that he will punish it with an extreame punishment therefore christ standing in our roome must not only suffer the miseries of this life but also die on the crosse that the verie extremitie of punishment which wee shoulde haue borne might be laide on him and so we in christ might fully satisfie god iustice for the wages of sinne is death secondly christ died that he might fulfill the truth of god worde which had saide that man for eating the forbidden fruit should die the death the properties of christs death are two the first that it was a voluntarie and willing death the second that it was a cursed death for the first whereas i say christes death was voluntarie i meane that christ died willingly and of his owne free accord gaue up him selfe to suffer upon the crosse howsoeuer the iewes did arraigne and condemne and crucifie him yet if he had not willed his owne death and of his free accord giuen him selfe to die not the iewes nor all the whole world coulde euer haue taken away his life from him hee dyed not by constraint or compulsion but most willingly and therfore he saith no man taketh my life from me but i saith hee lay it downe of my selfe i have power to lay it downe and have power to take it againe and our saviour christ gaue evident tokens hereof in his death for then iesus cryed with a loude voice and gave vp the ghost ordinarily man that die on the crosse languish away by little and little and before they come to yeelde up their lives they loose their speech and onely ratle or make a noise in the throate but christ at that verie instant when he vvas to giue up the ghost cryed with a loud voice which sheweth plainely that he in his death was more then a conquerour ouer death and therefore to give all man a token of his power and to shew that he died voluntarily it pleased him to crie with a loud voice and this made the centurion to say that he was the son of god againe christ dyed not as other man doe because they first give up the ghost and then lay their heads aside but he in token that his death was voluntarie first layes his head aside after the manner of a dead man and then afterward gives up the ghost lastly christ died sooner then man are wont to doe upon the crosse and this was the cause that made pilate wonder thar he was so soone dead now this came to passe not because he was loth to suffer the extremitie of death but hecause he woulde make it manifest to all man that hee had power to die or not to die and indeed this is our comfort that christ died not for vs by constraint but willingly of his owne accorde and as christs death was voluntarie so was it also an accursed death and therefore it is called the death of the crosse and it contained the first and the second death the first is the separation of the body from the soule the second is the separation of bodie amp soule from god and both were in christ for beside the bodily death he did in soule apprehend the wrath of god due to man for sinne amp that made him cry my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and here we must not omit a necessarie point namely how farre forth christ suffered death answer some thinke that he suffered onely a bodily death and such paines as follow the dissolution of nature but they no doubt come to short for why should christ haue feared death so greatly if it had bene nothing but the dissolution of nature some againe thinke that he died not onely the first but also the second death but it may be that is to goe to farre for if to die the first death be to suffer a totall separation of bodie and soule then also to die the second death is wholly and euerie way to be seuered from all fauour of god and at the least for a time to be oppressed of the same death as the daned are now this neuer befell christ no not in the middest of his sufferings considering that euen then he was able to call god his god therefore the safest is to follow the meane namely that christ died the first death in that his bodie and soule were really and wholly seuered yet without suffering any corruption in his bodie which is the effect and fruite of the same and that withall he further suffered the extreame horrours and pangs of the second death not dying the same death nor being forsaken of god more then in his owne apprehension or feeling for in the verie middest of his sufferings the father was well pleased with him and this which i say doeth not any whit lessen the sufficiencie of the merite of christ for whereas hee suffered truly the verie wrath of god and the verie torments of the damned in his soule it is as much as if all the man in the world had died the second death and had bin wholly cut off from god for euer and euer and no doubt christ died the first death only suffering the pangs of the second that the first death might be an entrance not to the second death which is eternall damnation but a passage to life eternall the benefites and comfortes which arise by the death of christ are specially foure the first is the change of our naturall death i say not the taking of it away for we must all die but whereas by nature death is a curse of god upon man for eating the forbidden fruite by the death of christ it is changed from a curse into a blessing and is made as it were a middle way and entrance to conveigh man out of this worlde into the kingdome of glorie in heauen and therefore it is saide christ by his death hath delivered them from the feare of death which all the daies of their lives vvere subiect to bondage a man that is to encounter vvith a scorpion if he knovve that it hath a sting he may be dismayed but being assured that the sting is taken away he need not feare to encounter therewith now death in his owne nature considered is this scorpion armed with a sting but christ our saviour by his death hath pulled out the sting of our death and on the crosse triumphantly saith o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory amp therefore euen the whe we feele the pags of death approch we should not feare but conceiue hope considering that our death is altered and changed by the vertue of the death of christ secondly the death of christ hath quite taken away the secod death fro those that are in christ as paul saith there is no condenation to them which are in christ iesus which walke not after the flesh but after the spirit thirdly the death of christ is a meanes to ratifie his last will and testament for this cause was christ the mediatour of the new testament that through death vvhich was for the redemption of the transgressions which were in the former t stament they which were called might receive the promise of the eternall inheritance for vvhere a testament is there must be the death of him that made the testament for the testament is confirmed when man are dead for it is yet of no force as long as he is alive that made it and therefore the death of christ doeth make his last will and testament which is his couenant of grace authenticall unto us fourthly the death of christ doth serue to abolish the originall corruption of our sinnefull hearts as a strong corasive laide to a sore eates out all the rotten and deade flesh euen so christs death being applyed to the heart of a penitent sinner by faith weakens and consumes the sinne that cleaues so fast unto our natures and dwelles within us some will say how can christes death which now is not because it is long ago past and ended kill sinne in vs now ansvver indeed if vvee regard the acte of christs death it is past but the vertue and power thereof endureth for euer and the power of christes death is nothing els but the power of his godhead vvhich inabled him in his death to ouercome hell the graue death and condemnation and to disburden him selfe of our sinnes now when wee haue grace to denie our selves and to put our trust in christ and by faith are ioyned to him then as christ himselfe by the power of his godhead ouercame death hell and damnation in himselfe so shall wee by the same power of his godhead kill amp crucifie sin amp corruption in our selues therfore seeing we reape such benefite by the death of christ if wee will shewe our selues to be christians let us reioyce in the death of christ and if the question be what is the chiefest thing wherein we reioyce in this world we may answere the very crosse of christ and the least droppe of his blood the duties to be learned by the death of christ are two the first concernes all ignorant and impenitent sinners such man whatsoeuer they be by the death of christ upon the crosse must be mooued to turne from their sinnes and if the consideration hereof will not mooue them nothing in the world will by nature euery man is a vassall of sinne and a bondslaue of sathan the deuill raignes and rules in all man by nature and wee our selues can doe nothing but serue and obey him nay which is more we lie under the fearefull curse of god for the least sinne well now see the love of the son of god that gaue himselfe willingly to death upon the crosse for thee that he might free thee from this most fearefull bondage wherefore let all those that liue in sinne and ignorance reason thus with theselues hath christ the son of god done this for us and shall we yet live still in our sinnes hath he set open as it were the very gates of hell and shall we yet lie weitring in out damnable waies and in the shadowe of death in the feare of god let the death of christ be a means to turne us to christ if it can not moue us let us be resolued that our case is dangerous to go yet further in this point euery one of us is by nature a sicke man wounded at the very heart by sathan though we feele it not yet we are deadly sicke amp beholde christ is the good phisition of the soule amp none in heauen or earth neither saint angell nor man can heale this our spirituall wound but he alone who though he were equall with the father yet he came downe from his bosome and became ma amp lived here many yeres in miserie amp contept and when no hearb nor plaister could cure this our deadly wound or desperate sicknes he was content to make a plaister with his owne blood the paine hee tooke in making it caused him to sweat water amp blood nay the making of it for us cost him his life in that he was content by his own death to free us from death which if it be true as it is most true the wofull amp wretched is our case if we will still liue in sinne amp will not use meanes to lay this plaister unto our hearts and after the plaister is applyed to the soule we should doe as a man that hath bene grievously sicke who whe he is on the mending hand gets strength by litle amp little and so should we become new creatures going on fro grace to grace and shew the same by liuing godlily righteously and soberly that the worlde may see that wee are cured of our spirituall disease o happy yes thrise happy are they that haue grace from god to do this the second duty concernes the which are repentant sinners hath christ giuen himselfe for thee amp is thy conscience setled in this then thou must answerably beare this minde that if thy life would serue for the glorie of god amp the good of his church thou wouldst then giue it most willingly if thou be called thereto secondly if christ for thy good hath giuen his life then thou must in like manner be content to die for thy brother in christ if need be he saith s john laid down his life for us therfore we ought to lay down our liues for our brother thirdly if christ was cote to shed his own hearts blood not for himself but for the sins of euery one of us the we must be thus affected that rather then by sinning we would willingly offend god we should be content to haue our own blood shed yes if these two things were put to our choise either to doe that vvhich might displease god or els to suffer death we must rather die then do the same of this mind haue bene all the martyrs of god who rather then they would yeild to idolatry were content to suffer most bitter torments amp cruell death yes euery good christian is so affected that hee had rather choose to die then to liue not moued by impatience in respect of the miseries of this life but because he would cease to offend so louing a father to sin is meat amp drinke to the world but to a touched amp repetat hart ther is no tormet so grievous as this is to sinne against god if once hee be perswaded that christ died for him thus much for christs death novv follovv those things vvhich befell christ when hee was newly dead and they are two especially the first that his legges were not broken as the legges of the tvvo thieves vvere of the first s john rendreth a reason namely that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith not a bone of him shall be broken which wordes vvere spoken by moses of the paschall lambe and are here applyed to christ as being typically figured therby and hence we obserue these tvvo things first that christ crucified is the true paschall lambe as s paul saieth christ our passeover is sacrificed and s john saith behold the lamb of god distinguishing him thereby from the typicall lambe in this that christ crucified is the true paschall lamb the childe of god hath vvonderfull matter of comfort the israelites did eate the passeouer in egypt and sprinkled the blood of the lambe on the postes of their dores that when the angell of god came to destroy the first borne both of man and beast and saw the blood upon their houses might passe ouer them that the plague should not be upon them to destruction so likewise if thou doest feede on the lambe of god and by a liuely faith sprinkle the dore of thine heart with his blood the iudgements of god in this life and the terrible curse of death vvith the fearefull sentence of condemnation at the day of iudgement amp all punishments due unto thy sinnes shall passe ouer thee and not so much as touch thee and whereas the legges of our sauiour christ were not broken by the souldiers who sought by all meanes possible to worke against him all the mischiefe they could wee may note that the enemy of christ and his church let them intende to shewe neuer so much malice against him they can not goe beyonde that libertie which god giueth them then god will is they can doe no more for their liues the medes and persians are called the lord sanctified ones cyrus is called the man of god counsell because whatsoeuer they intended against the people of god yet in all their proceedings they did nothing but that which god had determined before to be done and whe senacherib came against the iewes as a wild beast out of his denne the lord telleth hezekiah cocerning ashur that he will put his hooke in his nostrills amp his bridle in his lippes and bring him back againe the same way he came that is he will so rule him that he shall not do the lest hurt unto the iewes more the god will this is a matter of great cofort to god church oppressed with manifold enimies papists iewes turkes amp all infidel maliciously bent against it for christs sake now they may intend amp practise mischiefe but more then god will and counsell is they ca not doe for he hath his ring in their nostrills and his bridle in their lips to rule them as he listeth the second thing which fell out immediatly upon the death of christ is that the soldiers pearced his side with a speare amp thence issued water amp blood the use which ariseth of this point is twofolde first it serves to prooue that christ died truly amp not in shew or a fained death for there is about the heart a filme or skin like unto a purse wherein is contained cleare water to coole the heate of the heart and therefore when water amp blood issued out after the pearcing of the side it is very likely that that very skin was pearced for els in reason we can not coniecture whence this water should come s john an eye witnesse of this thing being about to proue that iesus the son of mary was the true messias bringeth in sixe witnesses three in heaue the father the worde and the holy ghost and three in earth the water the spirite and the bloode where no doubt hee alludeth to the water and blood that issued out of the side of christ by spirit wee may vnderstand the efficacie and operation of god spirite making man to bring foorth the fruits of the same as loue peace ioy ampc and the second witnes namely water hath relation to the water that came forth of christs side which signifieth the inward washing away of sinne amp the purging of the heart by christs blood which also is and was signified by the outwarde washing of the bodie with water in baptisme the thirde witnesse hee calles blood alluding to the blood that issued out of christs side vvhereby is signified the expiation or satisfaction made to god iustice for mans sinne the same use had the ceremoniall sprinkling with blood in the old testament typically signifying the sprinkling of christs blood now these three witnesses are not to be sought for in heauen but euerie christian man must search for them in his owne heart and conscience amp there shall hee finde them in some measure and this water and blood flowing out of the side of christ being now deade signifieth that he is our iustification and sanctification euen after his death amp that out of his death springs our life and therefore as eve was made of a ribbe taken out of the side of the first adam so springs the church of the blood that flowes out of the side of the second adam hauing thus intreated of christs execution let us nowe come to the last point namely the excellencie of christes passion consisting in these two points i a sacrifice ii a triumph for the first whe christ died he offered a propitiatorie amp reall sacrifice to his father amp herein his death amp passio differeth fro the sufferings amp death of all man whatsoeuer in this sacrifice we must consider things i who was the priest ii what was the sacrifice iii what vvas the altar iv the time wherein this sacrifice was offered the priest was christ himselfe as the author of the epistle to the hebrues prooues at large from the third chap to the and of him we are to consider these points the first what is the office of christs priesthood ansvver the office of christs priesthood stands in things i to teach doctrine amp therefore he is called the high priest of our profession that is of the gospell which we professe because he is the authour and doctour of the same ii to offer up himselfe unto his father in the behalfe of man for the appeasing of his wrath for sinne iii to make request or intercession to god the father that he would accept the sacrifice which hee offered on the crosse for us the secod is according to which nature he was a priest whether in his manhood or in his godhead or both togither ans the office of his priesthood is performed by him according to both his natures amp therfore he is a priest not as the papists would haue him according to his manhood only but as he is both god amp man for as he is a mediatour so is he a priest but christ is a mediatour according to both natures ech nature doing that which is peculiar to it amp conferring somthing to the worke of redemptio amp therfore he is a priest as he is both god amp ma the third point after what order is he a priest ans the scripture metioneth orders of priests the order of levi amp the order of melchisedeck christ was not a priest after the order of aaro amp yet notwithstading in that priesthood were many notable rites wherby the priesthood of our sauiour christ was resembled amp we may note especially first in the anointing of the high priests as of aaron amp his sonnes after him oile was powred on his head amp it ran down to the verie edge of his garments wherby was signified that christ the true high priest was annointed with the oile of gladnesse above his fellowes that his manhood was filled with the giftes and graces of god both in measure nuber amp degree aboue all me amp angels secondly the sumptuous amp gorgious apparell which the high priest put on when hee came into the sanctuary was a signe of the rich amp glorious robe of christs righteousnes which is the puritie amp integrity of his humane nature amp of his life thirdly the speciall parts of the high priests attire were first the ephod the shoulders whereof had onyx stones vvheron vvere engraue the names of the tribes of israel names on the one stone amp on the other as stones of remebrance of the childre of israel to god vvard secondly the brestplate of iudgement like the work of the ephod vvherin were set stones according to the names of the childre of israel graue as signets euery one after his name now by these ornamets vvere figured two things in christ by the first that he carries all the elect on his shoulders amp supports the by his spirit so long as they are in this world against the world the flesh amp the deuill by the secod that christ our high priest being now in his sanctuary in heauen hath in memory al the elect amp their very names are writte as it vvere in tables of gold before his face amp he hath an especiall loue amp care ouer them vpon this ground the church in the canticles praies on this maner set me as a seale on thy heart amp as a signet vpon thy arme and indeed this a matter of cofort to us all that christ hath our seueral names writte in pretious stones before his face though he be now in heaue amp vve on earth amp the particular estate of euery one of us is both knowe amp regarded of him again god gaue to moses the vrim amp thummim which was put on the brestplate of the high priest when he was to aske cousell fro god of things unknowe before the mercy seate whence god gaue answer what the vrim amp thummim was it is not known amp it is like it was not made by any arte of ma but giue by god amp how it vvas used vve can not tell but yet the signification of the wordes affordeth matter of meditatio vrim signifies lights amp thummim signifies perfections and by this a further matter was prefigured in christ vvho hath the perfite vrim amp thummim in his brest first because in him are hidde all the treasures of wisdome and knovvledge secodly because he reveiles to his church out of his word such things as none ca know but the childre of god as dauid saith the secret of the lord is reveiled to the that feare him and for this cause the spirit of christ is called the spirit of wisdom amp revelatio amp the spirit of god whereby we know the things that are giue unto us of god as namely our electio vocation iustificatio amp sanctificatio in this life amp our eternall glorificatio after this life yes to euery member of christ vvithin his church he giues a speciall spirit of revelatio vvherby he may knovve that god the father is his father the son the redeemer his redeemer amp the h ghost his sanctifier amp coforter lastly the high priest had a plate on his forehead amp therin vvas in graue the holines of iehovah this signified the holines of christ for as he is god he is holines it self amp as he is ma he is most holy being sanctified by the h ghost for this end that he might couer our sins amp unrighteousnes vvith his righteousnes amp holy obedience the secod order of priesthood is the order of melchisedec of which christ vvas as dauid saith thou article a priest for euer after the order of melchisedeck amp that in speciall respects i melchisedeck vvas both a priest amp a king so vvas christ ii melchisedeck had neither father nor mother because his historie is set dovvne vvith mention of neither so likevvise christ as hee is god had no mother and as hee is man he had no father the papists auouch christ to be a priest of this order in a new respect in that as melchisedeck offered bread and wine when abraham came from the slaughter of the kings so say they christ in the last supper did offer his owne bodie and bloode vnder the formes of bread and wine but this is a friuolous deuise of theirs for if we read hebr where this point is handled there is no comparison at all made of their two sacrifices but the resemblances before named are onely set downe againe it is not said in genesis that melchisedeck offered sacrifice but that he brought forth bread and wine and made a feast to abraham amp his company and if christ should be of the order of melchisedeck in regard of the offer of bread amp wine yet would this make much against the papists for melchisedeck brought forth true bread amp true wine but in the sacrifice of the masse there is no true breade nor true wine but as they say the reall bodie and blood of christ vnder the forme of bread and wine the point is whether there be any more reall priests of the new testament beside christ or no ans in the old testament there were many priests one following an other in continuall succession but of the new testament there is one onely reall priest christ iesus god amp man amp no more as the author of the hebr saith because he endureth for euer he hath an euerlasting priesthoode amp the word traslated euerlasting signifieth such a priesthood which cannot passe fro him to any other as the priesthood of aaron did and therfore the priesthood of christ is so tied to his owne person that none can haue the same but he neither man nor angel nor any other creature no not the father nor the h ghost but the factours of the church of rome will say that christ may haue man to be his deputies in his stead to offer sacrifice answer we must consider christ waies i as he is god ii as he is mediatour as he is god with the father amp with the holy ghost he hath kings amp magistrates to be his deputies on earth and therefore they are called elohim that is god but as he is mediatour and so consequently a priest and a king hee hath neither deputy nor vicegerent neither king to rule in his stead over his church nor priests to offer sacrifice for him nay hee hath no prophet to be his deputy as he is the doctour of the church and therefore he saith to his disciples be not called doctours for one is your doctour indeede he hath his ministers to teach man his will but a deputy to offer sacrifice in his steade he hath not and therfore we may with good conscience abhorre the massing priesthood of the church of rome as a thing fetched from the bottome of hell amp their massing priests as instruments of sathan holding this for a verie truth that we haue but one only priest eue christ himselfe god amp man indeed all christians are priests to offer up spirituall sacrifice but it is the propertie of christ alone to offer an outward amp reall sacrifice unto god now in the new testamet thus much of the first point who is the priest the second followeth what is the sacrifice answer the sacrifice is christ as he is man or the manhood of christ crucified as the priest is both god and man so the sacrifice is man not or the godhead god so it is said we are sanctified by the offer of the bodie of iesus christ touching this sacrifice sundrie questions are to be skanned the first what kind of sacrifice it was answer in the olde testament there were two kinde of sacrifices one propitiatorie which serued to satisfie for sinne the other eucharisticall for praise and thankesgiuing now the sacrifice of christ was a sacrifice propitiatorie specially prefigured by the typicall sacrifice called the whole burnt offer the use whereof was from the beginning for as it was all consumed to ashes upon the altar and turned into smoke so the fire of god wrath did seaze upon christ on the crosse and did consume him as it were to nothing to make us something secondly whe noe offered an whole burnt offer after the flood it is saide god smelled a savour of rest not because hee was delighted with the smell of the sacrifice but because he approued his faith in christ and hereby was figured that christ upo the crosse was an offer amp a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour vnto god because god was well pleased therewith nowe whereas christ was content wholly to offer up himselfe to appease the wrath of his father for us it must teach us to giue our body and soules as holy liuing amp acceptable sacrifices wholly dedicating them to the seruice of god the second question is how oft christ offered himselfe ans once only amp no more this must be held as a principle of divinitie with once offer hath he consecrated for ever them that are sanctified amp againe christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many and it serueth to ouerthrow the abominable sacrifice of the masse in which the true bodie amp blood of christ is offered under the formes of bread and wine really amp substatially as they say for the remissio of the sinnes of the quicke amp the deade amp that continually but if this vnbloody sacrifice of christ be good then it is either the continuing of that which was begun on the crosse by christ himselfe or the iteratio of it by the masse priest now let papists choose whether of these they will if they say it is the continuing of the sacrifice of christ then they speake outragious blasphemy for it is in effect to say that christes sacrifice was not perfect but only begun on the crosse and must be accomplished by the masse priest to the end of the worlde if they affirme the second that it is an iteration of christs sacrifice the also they speake blasphemie for hereby they make it also an imperfite sacrifice because it is repeated amp iterated for upo this ground doth the authour to the hebrues prooue that the sacrifices of the old testament were imperfit because they were daily offered and wheras they say that there be kinds of sacrifices one bloody once only offred upo the crosse the other unbloody which is daily offred i answer that this distinctio hath no ground out of god word neither was it known to the h ghost who saith that without blood there is no remission of sinnss the questio is what is the fruit of this sacrifice answer the whole effect therof is contained in these things i the oblation of christ purgeth the beleeuer fro all his sinnes whether they be originall or actuall so it is said if we walk in the light we haue fellowship one with another amp the blood of iesus christ his son purgeth vs from all sinne whether they be of omission in regard of our duties or of comission in doing evil ii the oblatio serueth for the iustifying of a sinner before god as paul saith we are iustified by his blood amp are reconciled to god by his death this being here remebred that in the passio of christ we include his legall obediece wherby he fulfilled the law for us iii the oblatio of christ serves to purge mens cosciences fro dead works how much more then shall the blood of christ which through the eternall spirite offred himselfe without spot to god purge your consciences from dead works to serue the living god iv the oblation of christ procures us liberty to enter to heauen by the blood of christ iesus we may be bold to enter into the holy place by the new and living way which he hath prepared for vs through the vail that is his flesh by our sinnes there is a partition wall made betwene god amp vs but christ by offring himselfe upon the crosse hath beaten down this wall opened heauen and as it were trained the way with his own blood wherby we may enter into the kingdome of god and without the which we can not enter in at all the last questio is how this sacrifice may be applied to vs ans the meanes of applying the sacrifice be two i the hand of god which offreth ii the had of the beleeuer that receiveth the sacrifice offred the hand of god wherby he offereth unto us his benefit is the preaching of the word amp the administratio of the sacraments baptisme amp the lord supper amp whersoeuer these his holy ordinances are rightly administred amp put in practise there the lord puts forth his hand unto us amp offereth most freely the vertue amp benefit of the death of christ and then in the next place cometh the hand of the beleeuer which is faith in the heart which when god offereth doth apprehend and receiue the thing offered and make it ours the third thing to be spoke of is the altar wheron christ offred himselfe the altar was not the crosse but rather the godhead of christ he was both the priest the sacrifice and the altar the sacrifice as he is man the priest as he is both god amp ma the altar as he is god the propertie of an altar is to sanctifie the sacrifice as christ saith ye fooles amp blinde whether is greater the offer or the altar that senctifieth the offer now christ as he is god sanctifieth himself as he was man amp therfore saieth he for their sakes sanctifie i my selfe by doing things i by setting a part the manhood to be a sa rifice unto his father for our sins ii by giuing to this sacrifice merit or efficacie to deserue at god hads remissio of our sins the mahood of christ without the godhead hath no vertue nor efficacie in it self to be a meritorious sacrifice amp therfore the dignity amp excellencie which it hath is deriued thence as for the chalkie amp stony altars of the church of rome they are nothing els but the toyes of mans brain christ himselfe is the only reall altar of the new testament and instead of altars which were under the lawe wee haue now the lord table vvheron vve celebrate the sacraments of his body and blood to shew forth his death till he come the point is concerning the time of christs oblation which he himselfe calleth the acceptable yere of the lord alluding unto another yere under the lavve called the yeere iubile vvhich was every yere amog the iewes in which at the sound of a trumpet all that had set or sold their possessions receiued them againe all that were bondmen were then set at libertie this iubile was but a figure of that perfect deliverace which vvas to be attained by christs passio which was no temporarie deliverance for euery yere but an eternal freedome from the bondage of sinne hell death amp condemnation and the preaching of the worde is the trumpet sounded which proclaimeth unto us freedome fro the kingdome of darkenesse amp invites us to come amp dvvell in perfect peace vvith christ himselfe well if the yeere of perpetuall iubile be novv come in what a vvre ched estate are all our loose amp blind people that esteem nothing of that libertie vvhich is offered to them but choose rather to liue in their sinnes and so in bondage under satan amp condemnation then to be at freedome in christ novv follovv the uses vvhich are to be made of the sacrifice of christ the prophet aggai saith that the second temple built by zorubbabell vvas nothing in beautie unto the first vvhich was built by salomon and the reason is plaine for it vvanted five things vvhich the first temple had i the appearing of the presence of god at the mercie seat betweene the two cherubims ii the vrim and thummim on the breast plate of the high priest iii the inspiration of the holy ghost vpon extraordinarie prophets iv the arke of the covenant for that was lost in the captiuitie v fire from heauen to burne the sacrifices yet for all this the prophet afterward saith the glorie of the last house shall be greater then the first now it may be demaunded how both these sayings can stand together answer we are to know that the second temple was standing in the time when christ was crucified for our sinnes and it was the sacrifice of christ which gaue glorie and dignitie to the second temple though otherwise for building and outward ornaments it was farre inferiour to the first and by this we are taught that if we would bring glorie vnto our owne selues vnto our houses and kindred either before god or before man we must labour to be partakers of the sacrifice of christ and the sprinkling of his blood to purge our hearts this is the thing that brings renowne both to place and person how base soeuer we be in the eyes of the world secondly all oblations and meate offerings were sprinkled with salt and euery sacrifice of propitiation which was to be burned to ashes was first salted and hereby two things were signified the first that euery one of vs in our selues are loathsome or vile in the sight of god like vnto stinking carrion or raw flesh kept long vnpoudered a dead and rotten carkeise is loathsome vnto vs but we in our selues are a thousand times more loathsome vnto god the second that we are as it were salted and made sauorie and acceptable to god by the vertue of the sacrifice of christ vpon the crosse our dutie the is to labour that we may feele in our selues the biting and sharpnes of the oblation of christ to wast amp cosume the superfluities of sinne and the corruptions of our natures and we must withall indeauour that the whole course of our liues and our speach it selfe be gratious and poudred with this salt least god at length spue vs out of his mouth to this end hath god appointed his ministers to be the salt of the earth that by their ministerie they might applie the death of christ and season the people and it hath pleased god to besprinkle this land with more plentie of this salt then hath beene heretofore but alas small is the number of them that giue any rellish of their good seasoning the more lamentable is their case for as flesh that can not be seasoned with salt putrifies so man that cannot be sweetned and changed by the sacrifice of christ doe rotte and perish in their sinnes the water that issued from vnder the threshold of the sanctuarie when they came into mare mortuum the dead sea the water thereof were holsome but myrie places and marishes which could not be seasoned were made saltpits now these water are the preaching of the gospell of christ which flowing through all the parts of this ile if it doe not season and chaunge our nation it shall make it as places of nettles and salt pits and at length be an occasion of the eternall curse of god thirdly christs priesthoode serues to make euery one of vs also to be priests and being priests we must likewise haue our sacrifice and our altar our sacrifice is the cleane offer which is the lifting vp of pure hands to god without wrath or doubting in our praiers also our body and soules our hearts and affections the workes of our liues and the works of our callings all which must be dedicated to the seruice of god for his glorie and the good of his church the altar whereon wee must offer our sacrifice is christ our redeemer both god and man because by the vertue of his death as with sweet odours he perfumes all our obedience and makes it acceptable to god the ministers of the gospell are also in this manner priests as paul insinuateth when he calleth the gentiles his offer vnto god and the preaching of the word is as it were a sacrificing knife whereby the old adam must be killed in vs and we made an holy and acceptable sweete smelling oblation vnto god sanctified by the holy ghost therefore euery one that heareth god worde preached and taught must endeauour that by the profitable hearing thereof his sinnes and whole nature may be subdued and killed as the beast was slaine and sacrificed vpon the altar by the hand of the leuite lastly the exhortation of the holy ghost must here be considered seeing saith he we haue an high priest which is ouer the house of god let vs draw neere with a true heart in assurance of faith sprinkled in our hearts from an euill conscience and washed in our body with pure water the meaning of the words is this that if christ haue offered such a sacrifice of such value and price which procureth pardon of sinne iustification sanctification and redemption then we must labour to be partakers of it to haue our body and soules purified and clensed by his blood and sanctified throughout by the holy ghost that thereby we may be made fit to doe sacrifice acceptable to god in christ this is the vse which the apostle maketh of the doctrine of christs priesthood in that place which also euery man should applie vnto himselfe for why should we liue in our sinnes and wicked waies euery houre incurring the daunger of god iudgements seeing christ hath offered such a sacrifice whereby we may be purged and clensed and at length freed from all woe and miserie thus much of christs sacrifice now follows his triumph vpon the crosse that christ did triumph when he was vpon the crosse it is plainly set downe by the apostle paul where he saith that putting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against vs which was contrarie to vs he euen tooke it out of the way and fastened it vpon the crosse and hath spoiled the principality and powers and hath made shew of them openly and hath triumphed ouer them in the same crosse this triumph is set forth by signes amp testimonies of two sorts i by signes of his glorie and maiestie ii by signes of his victorie on the crosse the signes of his glorie and maiestie are principally seauen the first is the title set ouer his head vpon the crosse iesus of nazareth king of the iewes the ende why titles were set ouer the heads of malefactours was that the beholders might know the cause of the punishment and be admonished to take heede of like offences and be stirred vp to a dislike of the parties executed for their offences and therefore no doubt pilate wrote the title of christ for the aggrauating of his cause and that with his owne hand yet marke the strange euent that followed for when pilate was about to write the superscription god did so gouerne and ouerrule both his heart and hand that instead of noting some crime he sets downe a most glorious and worthie title calling him iesus of nazareth king of the iewes which words containe the very summe and pith of the whole gospell of christ deliuered by the patriarkes and prophets from age to age we must not thinke that pilate did this of any good minde or vpon any loue or fauour that he bare to christ but onely as he was guided and ouerruled by the power of god for the advancement of the honour and glorie of christ the like did caiphas who though a sworne enemie to christ yet he vttered a prophecie of him saying that it was necessarie that one should die for the people nor that he had any intent to prophecie but because the lord vsed him as an instrument to publish his truth and when baalam for the wages of vnrighteousnes would haue cursed the lordes people for his life hee could not nay all his cursings were turned into blessings by this then it appeares that it is not possible for any man doe what he can to stoppe the course of the gospell of christ nay as we see god can raise vp the wicked sometime to spread abroad and to publish the truth though they themselues intend the contrarie furthermore let vs marke that when the iewes did most of all intend to bring disgrace and ignominie vpon our sauiour christ then did they most of all extoll and magnifie his name they could not for their liues haue giuen him a more renowmed title then this that he was king of the iewes and the same is the case of all the members of christ for let a man walke in good conscience before god and man he shall finde this to be true that when he is most disgraced in the world then commonly he is most honoured with god and man further pilate wrote this superscription in three languages hebrew greeke and latine and no doubt the ende thereof in the prouidence of god was that the passion of christ as also the publishing of his kingdome and gospell might be spread ouer the whole world this shewes the malice of the church of rome which will not suffer the word of god to be published but in the latine tongue least the people should be intangled in errours againe when pilate had thus written the superscription the high priests and pharisies offended thereat came to pilate willing him to chaunge the title saying write not the king of the iewes but that he said i am the king of the iewes but pilat answeared them againe that which j haue written i haue written though pilate had bin ouerruled before to condemne christ to death against his owne conscience yet will he not in any wise condescend to change the superscription how comes this to passe surely as he was ruled by the hand of god in penning it so by the same hand of god was he confirmed in not changing it hence we learne sundrie instructions first that no man in the world let him endeauour himselfe to the vttermost of his power is able to stoppe the course of the kingdom of god it stands firme and sure and all the world is not able to preuaile against it secondly whereas pilate being but an heathen man was thus constant that he will not haue his writing chaunged we may note how permanent amp vnchageable the writings of the holy word of god are they are not the wordes of heathen man but were spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles as god gaue them vtterance the booke of scripture therefore is much more immutable so as no creature shall be able to chaunge the least part of it till it be fulfilled thirdly by pilates constancie we learne to be constant in the practise and profession of the religion of christ this is a necessarie lesson for these daies wherein mens professions doe fleete like water and goe and come with the tyde many zealous professours to day but to morow as cold as water and the complaint of the lord touching times past agrees to our daies o ephraim what shall i say to thee thy righteousnes is like the morning dewe the second is the conuersion of the thiefe a most worthie argument of the godhead of christ for by it when he was vpon the crosse and in the very middest of his passion he giues vnto all the world a liuely and notable experience of the vertue and power of his death so as his very enemy might not onely behold the passion it selfe but also at the same time acknowledge the admirable efficacie thereof and therefore with the passion of christ we must ioyne the conuersion of the thiefe which is as it were a crystall glasse wherein we may sensibly behold the endles merit and vertue of the obedience of christ to his father euen to the death of the crosse and therefore i will briefly touch the speciall instructions which are to be learned by it first let vs marke that both the thieues in euery respect were equal both wicked and leud liuers and for their notorious faults both attached condemned amp executed both on the crosse at the same time with christ yet for all this the one repenting was saued the other was not and in their two exaples we see the state of the whol world wherof one part is chosen to life eternall and thereupon attaines to faith and repentance in this life the rest are reiected in the eternall counsell of god for iust causes knowne to himselfe and such being left to theselues neuer repent at all secondly we are taught hereby that the whole worke of our conuersion and saluation must be ascribed wholly to the meere mercie of god of these two thieues the one was as deepely plunged in wickednes as the other and yet the one is saued the other condemned the like was in iacob and esau both borne at one time and of the same parents amp neither of them had done good nor euill when they were borne yet one was then loued the other was hated yes if we regard outward prerogatiues esau was the first borne and yet was refused furthermore the thiefe on the crosse declareth his conversion by manifest signes and fruites of repentance as appeares by the words which he spake to his fellowe fearest not thou god seeing thou article in the same condemnation though hands and feete were fast nailed to the crosse yet heart and tongue is at libertie to giue some tokens of his true repentance the people of this our land heare the word but for the most part are without either profit in knowledge or amendment of life yet for all this they perswade themselues that they haue good hearts amp good meanings though they cannot beare it a way and vtter it so wel as others but alas poore soules they are deluded by satan for a man that is conuerted can not but expresse his conuersion and bring foorth the fruits thereof and therefore our sauiour christ saith if a man beleeue in me out of his bellie shal flow river of water of life the grace as elihu saith of god is like newe wine in a vessell which must haue a vent and therefore he that sheweth no tokens of god grace in this life is not as yet conuerted let him thinke amp say of himselfe what he will can a man haue life and neuer mooue nor take breath and can he that bringeth forth no fruit of his conuersion liue vnto god well let vs nowe see what were the fruites of the thiefes repentance they may be reduced to foure heads first he rebukes his fellow for mocking christ indeauouring thereby to bring him to the same condition with himselfe if it were possible whereby he discouers vnto vs the propertie of a true repentant sinner which is to labour and striue so much as in him lieth to bring all man to the same state that he is in thus dauid hauing tried the great loue and fauour of god toward himselfe breaketh foorth and saith come children hearken vnto me and i will teach you the feare of the lorde shewing his desire that the same benefits which it pleased god to bestow on him might also in like manner be conveighed to others therefore it is a great shame to see man professing religion carried away with euery company and with the vanities and fashions of the world whereas they should rather draw euen the worst man that be to the fellowship of those graces of god which they haue receiued that which the lord spake to the prophet ieremie must be applied to all man let them returne vnto thee but returne not thou vnto them in instruments of musicke the string out of tune must be set vp to the rest that be in tune and not the rest to it againe in that he checkes his fellowe it shewes that those which be touched for their owne sinnes are also grieued when they see other man sinne and offende god but to goe further in this point let vs diligently and carefully marke the manner of his reproofe fearest thou not god seeing thou article in the same condemnation in which words he rippes vp his lewdnesse euen to the quicke and giues him a worthie item telling him that the cause of all their former wickednesse had beene the want of the feare of god and this point must euery one of vs marke with great diligence for if we enter into our hearts and make a thorough search wee shall finde that this is the roote and fountaine of all our offences we miserable man for the most part haue not grace to consider that we are alwaies before god and to quake and tremble at the consideration of his presence and this makes vs so often to offend god in our liues as we doe abraham comming before abimelech shifting for himselfe said that sara was his sister and beeing demaunded why he did so answeared because he thought the feare of god was not in that place insinuating that he which wants the feare of god will not make conscience of any sinne whatsoeuer vvould wee then euen from the bottome of our hearts turne to god and become newe creatures then let vs learne to feare god vvhich is nothing else but this vvhen a man is persvvaded in his ovvne heart and conscience that wheresoeuer he be he is in the presence and sight of god and by reason thereof is afraide to sinne this wee must haue fully settled in our hearts if wee desire to learne but the first lesson of true wisedome but what reason vseth the thiefe to drawe his fellowe to the feare of god thou article saith he in the same condemnation that is by thy sinnes and manifolde transgressions thou hast deserued death and it is nowe most iustly inflicted vpon thee wilt thou not yet feare god where we are taught that temporall punishments and crosses ought to be meanes to worke in vs the feare of god for that is one ende why they are sent of god it is good for me saith dauid that i haue beene chastised that i may learne thy statutes and paul saith when we are chastised we are nurtured of the lord and the iewes are taught by the prophet micah to say i will beare the wrath of the lord because i haue sinned against him the second fruit of his conuersion is that he condemneth himselfe and his fellow for their sinnes saying indeede we are righteously here for we receiue things worthie for that we haue done that is we haue wonderfully sinned against god maiestie and against our brother and therefore this grieuous punishment which we beare is most iust and due vnto vs this fruit of repentance springs and growes very thinne among vs for fewe there be which doe seriously condemne themselues for their owne sinnes the manner of man is to condemne others and to cry out that the world was neuer so badde but bring them home to themselues and you shall finde that they haue many excuses and defences as plaisterworke to cast ouer their foule and filthie sinnes and if they be vrged to speake against themselues the worst will be thus god helpe vs we are all sinners euen the best of vs but certen it is that he which is thoroughly touched in conscience for his sinnes both can and will speake more against himselfe for his manifold offences then all the worlde besides thus paul when he was conuerted calls himselfe the chiefe of all sinners and the prodigall childe confesseth that he had sinned against heauen and against his father and was not worthie to be called his childe the third fruit of his conuersion is that he excuseth our sauiour christ and giueth testimonie of his innocencie saying but this man hath done nothing amisse marke here pilate condemned christ herod mocked him all the learned scribes and pharisies condemned him and the people cry away with him let him be crucified and among his owne disciples peter denied him and the rest ranne away there remains onely this poore sillie wretch vpon the crosse to giue testimonie of christs innocencie whereby we learne that god chuseth the simple ones of this world to ouerthrow the wisdome of the wise and therefore we must take heed that we be not offended at the gospel of christ by reason that for the most part simple amp mean man in the world imbrace it nay marke further this one thiefe being conuerted had a better iudgement in matters concerning god kingdome then the whole bodie of the iewes and by this all students may learne that if they desire to haue in themselues vpright iudgement in matters of religion first of all they must become repentant sinners and though a man haue neuer so much learning yet if he be carried away with his owne blinde affections amp lusts they will corrupt amp darken his iudgement man which worke in mynes and coale pits vnder the earth are troubled with nothing so much as with dampes which make their candle burne darke amp sometimes put it quite out now euery mans sinnes are the damps of his heart which when they take place do dimme the light of his iudgement and cast a mist ouer the mind amp darken the vnderstanding amp reason and therefore a needefull thing it is that man in the first place should prouide for their owne conuersion the fourth fruite of his repentance is that he praieth for mercie at christs hands lord saith he remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome in which praier we may see what is the propertie of faith this thiefe at this instat heard nothing of christ but the skornings and mockings of the people and he saw nothing but a base estate full of ignominie and shame and the cursed death of the crosse yet neuerthelesse he now beleeues in christ and therfore intreats for saluation at his hande hence we learne that it is one thing to beleeue in christ and an other to haue feeling and experience and that euen then when we haue no sense or experience we must beleeue for faith is the subsisting of things which are not seene and abraham aboue hope did beleeue vnder hope and iob saith though thou kill me yet will i beleeue in thee in philosophie a man begins by experience after which commes knowledge and beliefe as whe a man hath put his hand to the fire and feeles it to be hoat he comes to know thereby that fire burnes but in divinitie we must beleeue though we haue no feeling first comes faith and after comes sense and feeling and seeing the ground of our religion stands in this to beleeue thinges neither seene nor felt to hope aboue all hope and without hope in extremitie of affliction to beleeue that god loueth vs when he seemeth to be our enemie and to perseuere in the same to the ende the answer which christ made to his praier was this night shalt thou be vvith in paradise whereby he testifies in the middest of his sufferings the power which he had ouer the soules of man and verifies that gratious promise aske and ye shall receiue seeke and ye shall finde knocke and it shall be opened to you and withall confutes the popish purgatorie for if any man should haue gone to that forged place of torment then the thiefe vpon the crosse who repenting at the last gaspe wanted time to make satisfaction for the temporall punishment of his sinnes and by this conuersion of the thiefe we may learne that if any of vs would turne to god and repent we must haue three thinges i the knowledge of our owne sinnes ii from the bottome of our heartes wee must confesse and condemne our selues for them and speake the worst that can be of our selues in regard of our sinnes iii we must earnestly craue pardon for them and call for mercie at god handes in christ withall reforming our liues for the time to come if we doe we giue tokens of repentance if not we may thinke what we will but we deceiue our selues and are not truly conuerted and here wee must be warned to take heede least we abuse as many doe the example of the thiefe to conclude thereby that wee may repent when we will because the thiefe on the crosse was conuerted at the last gaspe for there is not a second example like to this in all the whole bible it was also extraordinarie in deede sundrie man are called at the eleuenth houre but it is a most rare thing to finde the conuersion of a sinner after the second houre and at the point of the twelfth this mercie god vouchsafed this one thiefe that he might be a glasse in which we might behold the efficacie of the death of christ but the like is not done to many me no not to one of a thousand let vs rather cosider the estate of the other thiefe who neither by the dealing of his fellow nor by any speach of christ could be brought to repentance let vs not therefore deferre our repentance to the houre of death for then we shall haue sore enemy against vs the world the flesh the deuill and a guiltie conscience and the best way is beforehand to preuent them and experience shews that if a man deferre repentance to the last gaspe often when he would repent he cannot let vs take salomons counsell remember thy creator in the daies of thy youth before the euill daies come if we will not heare the lord when he calleth vs he will not heare vs when we call on him the third signe was the ecclipsing or darkning of the sun from the sixt houre to the ninth and this ecclipse was miraculous for by the course of nature the sun is neuer ecclipsed but in the new moone whereas contrariwise this ecclipse was about the time of the passeouer which was alwaies kept at the full moone question is made touching the largenes of it some mooued by the words of luke who saith that darkenesse was vpon the whole earth hath thought that the ecclipse was vniuersall ouer the whole word but i rather thinke that saint lukes meaning is that it was ouer the whole region or countrey of iurie for if such a wonder had happened ouer the whole world all historiographers greeke and latine and astronomers diligent obseruers of all ecclipses would haue made speciall mention thereof and though some euseb chronicle tertull apolog c ores l c writers say that it was ouer the whole earth and that it was set downe in record both by the romanes amp grecians yet all their writings prooue no more but this that it was ouer iurie and galelie and the country bordering neere vnto the vses of this miracle are manifold i this darkening of the sun giues a checke to the iewes for their crucifying of christ they were not ashamed to apprehend accuse and condemne him yet this glorious creature the sun pulleth in his beames beeing as it were ashamed to behold that which they were not ashamed to doe ii it serues to signifie the great iudgement of god to come vpon the iewes for as when christ suffered darkenes was ouer all the land of iurie and all the worlde besides had the light of the sun so shortly after blindnes of minde was ouer the whole nation of the iewes and all the world besides saw the son of righteousnes shining vnto them in the preaching of the gospell iii it serues to aduertise vs that such as carrie themselues towards christ as the iewes did haue nothing else in them but darknesse and that they sit in darkenesse and shadow of death and therefore not able any whit better to see the way that leadeth vnto life then he which is cast into a darke dungeon can who if they thus remaine shall at length be cast into vtter darkenesse this beeing the estate of all them that be foorth of christ we must labour to be freed from this darknes that the day starre may rise in our hearts and shine vpon vs and put life into vs iiii this miraculous and wonderfull darkening of the sun doth conuince the iewes that christ whome they crucified was the lord of glorie and the sauiour of the world and it is very likely that this was the principall end of this miracle for whereas neither his doctrine nor his former miracles could mooue them to acknowledge him for the messias yet this one worke of god doth as it were strike the naile to the head and stoppe all their mouthes v besides this whereas at that very instant when christ was about to make a satisfaction to the iustice of his father for our sinnes the sun was thus darkned it teacheth vs first to thinke of the passion of christ not as of a light matter but as of one of the greatest wonders of the worlde at the sight whereof the very frame of nature was chaunged secondly to thinke of our owne sinnes as the vilest things in the world and that they deserue the intollerable wrath of god considering that at the time when they were to be abolished the course of nature euen in the very heauens is turned vpside downe the fourth signe is the rending of the vaile of the temple from the toppe to the bottome the temple was deuided into two parts the one more inward into which no man might come but the high priest and that once a yeare and it was called the holy of holies the other was that where the people came and offered sacrifices vnto the lord nowe that which parted the temple into these two parts was called the vaile and at the time of christs passion it was re t from the toppe to the very bottome this hath diverse vses i the holy of holies signified the third heauen where god sheweth himselfe in glorie and maiestie vnto his saints now the rending of the vaile figureth vnto vs that by the death of christ heauen which was otherwise shut by our sinnes is nowe set open and a way made to enter thereto ii it signifieth that by the death of christ we haue all without impediment free accesse to come vnto god the father by earnest praier in the name of christ which is a most vnspeakeable benefit iii it signifieth that by christs death an ende is put to all ceremonies to ceremoniall worship and the sacrifices of the old testament and that therefore in the newe testament there remaineth one onely reall and outward sacrifice that is christ crucified on the crosse and the whole seruice and worship of god for outwarde ceremonies most simple and plaine iiii the temple was the chiefe and one of the most principall prerogatiues that the iewes had it was their glorie that they had such a place wherein they might worship and doe seruice to the true god and for the temples sake god often spared them and therefore daniel praieth o lord heare the prayer of thy servant and his supplication and cause thy face to shine vpon thy sanctuarie that lieth wast for the lord sake yet for all this when they beganne to crucifie the lord of life their prerogatiues helps the not nay they are depriued thereof and god euen with his owne hand rends the vaile of the temple in sunder signifying vnto them that if they forsake him he will also forsake them and so may we say of the church of england no doubt for the gospels sake we haue outward peace and safetie and many other blessings and are in account with other nation yet if we make no conscience to obey the word of god and if we haue no loue of christ and his members god will at length remooue his candlesticke from vs and vtterly depriue vs of this ornament of the gospell and make our land as odious vnto all the world as the land of the iewes is at this day let vs therefore vvith all care and diligence shew forth our loue both to christ himselfe amp to his members and adorne the gospell which we professe by bringing foorth fruites worthie of it the fifth signe is the earthquake whereby hard rockes were clouen asunder and it serues very fitly to signifie further vnto vs that the sinne of the iewes in putting christ to death was so heauie a burden that the earth could not beare it but trembled thereat though the iewes themselues made no bones of it and it is a thing to be wondered at that the earth doe not often in these daies tremble and quake at the monstrous blasphemies and fearefull othes by the wounds and blood and heart of christ whereby his members are rent asunder and he traiterously crucified againe secondly the earthquake shewes vnto vs the exceeding and wonderfull hardnes of the hearts of the iewes and ours also they crucified christ and were not touched with any remorse and we can talke and heare of his death yes we can say he was crucified for our sinnes and yet are we nothing affected therewith our hearts will not rend when as hard rocks cleaue asunder thirdly the mooving of the earth amp the rending of the rocks asunder may be a signe vnto vs of the vertue of the doctrine of the gospell of christ which is nothing els but the publishing of the passion of his death which being preached shal shake heauen and earth sea and land it shall moue the earthen hard and rockie hearts of man and raise vp of meere stones and rocks children vnto abraham but the maine vse and end of this point is to prooue that he that was crucified was the true messias the son of god and therefore had the power of heauen and earth and could mooue all things at his pleasure the sixt signe of the power of christ is that graves did open and many body of the saintes which slept arose and came out of their graues after his resurrection and went into the holy citie and appeared unto many the use of this signe is this it signifies unto us that christ by his death upon the crosse did vanquish death in the graue and opened it and thereby testified that he was the resurrection and the life so that it shall not haue euerlasting dominion ouer us but that he vvill raise us up from death to life and to euerlasting glorie the seuenth signe is the testimonie of the centurion with his souldiours which stood by to see christ executed s marke saith when he saw that christ thus crying gaue up the ghost he said truly this was the son of god thus we see it is an easie matter for christ to defend his own cause let iudas betray him peter denie him and all the rest forsake him yet he can if it so please him make the centurion that standeth by to see him executed to testifie of his innocencie but what vvas the occasion that mooued him to giue so worthy a testimonie s matthew saith it was feare and that feare was caused by hearing the loud crie of christ amp by seeing the earthquake and thinges which vvere done and this must put us in minde not to passe by god iudgements which daily fall out in the worlde but take knowledge of them and as it were to fix both our eyes on them for they are notable meanes to strike and astonish the rebellious heart of man and to bring it in awe and subiectio to god after that the two first captaines with their fifties commanding the prophet elijah to come downe to king achaziah were consumed with fire from heauen the king sent his third captaine ouer fiftie with his fiftie to fetch him downe but what doth he it is said he fell on his knee before eliah and besought him saying o man of god i pray thee let my life and the lives of these fiftie servant be pretious in thine eyes but what was the cause why he prayed thus surely he obserued what iudgements of god fell upon his two former fellowe captaines beholde saith hee there came downe fire from heauen and devoured the two former captaines with their fifties therefore let my life be pretious now in thy sight thus laying to his owne heart and making use of god iudgements hee humbled himselfe and was spared with his fiftie and habbaccuk saith when i hearde the voice namely of god iudgements rottennesse entred into my bones and i trembled in my selfe that i might be safe in the day of the lorde nowe what this feare of the centurion was there is a further question and it is verie like that it was but a sudden motion or a certaine preparatiue to better things for he was but an heathen man and had as yet no knowledge of christ and whether hee repented or not it is uncerten and wee must not maruell at this for there are many sudden motions in shewe verie good that upon like occasions rise in the heartes of naturall man when god plagued the land of egypt then pharaoh sent for moses and confessed that the lorde was righteous but he and his people were wicked and desired moses to pray to god to take away the plague who did so but so soone as the hand of god was stayed he returned to his olde rebellion againe and as a dogge that commeth out of the water shaketh his eares and yet returneth into it againe so is the maner of the world when crosses and calamities befall man as sicknesse losse of friends or goods then with ahab they outwardly humble them selues and goe softly they use to frequent the place where the word is preached and god name called upon but alas common experience shewes that these things are but fittes arising of uncerten and flittering motions in the heart for so soone as the crosse is remooued they returne to their old byas againe amp become as bad amp as backwarde as euer they vvere being like to the tree that lies in the water which for a while is greene but afterward withereth and therefore wee for our partes when wee haue any good motions come into our hearts as the beginnings of further grace wee must not quench them but cherish and preserue them remembring that the kingdome of heauen is like a graine of mustard seed which vvhen it is sowne is the least of all seedes but afterward it groweth up into a tree that the foules of the heauen may build their neasts in it amp like to this are the first motions of god spirite and therefore they must be cherished and maintained and thus much for the signes of the power of christs godhead now follovves the second part of the triumph of christ which containeth signes of his victorie upon the crosse notably expressed by paul when he saith and putting out the handwriting of ordinances which was against us which was contrary to us he euen tooke it out of the way amp fastened it upon the crosse amp hath spoiled the principality amp powers and hath made a shew of them openly amp hath triumphed over them in the same in vvhich wordes hee alludeth to the manner of heathen triumphs for it was the custome of heathen princes when they had gotten the victorie over their enimies first to cause a pillar of stone or some great oke to be cut down and set up in the place of victorie vpon which either the names of the chiefe enemy vvere set or their heads vvere hanged or vvords vvere written in the pillar to testifie the victorie this being done there follovved an open shewe in vvhich first the conquerour prepares for himselfe a chariot of victory wherin he vvas himselfe to ride and then the chiefe of his enemy bound amp pinioned vvere led openly after him novve on the same maner upon the crosse there was a pitcht field the emperour on the one side was christ his enemy on the other side were the vvorld the flesh hell death damnation the deuill and all his angels all vvhich banding themselues against him vvere all subdued by him upon the same crosse amp he himselfe gaue tvvo signes of his triuph one vvas a monumet of the victory the other an ope shevv of his coquest novv the monumet of christs victory vvas the crosse it self vvheron he nailed the obligatio or bill vvhich vvas against us vvherby satan might haue accused amp condened us before god for vve must cosider that god the father is as a creditour and vvee all debters unto him hee hath a bill of our handes vvhich is the lawe in that it giueth testimonie against us first by the legall washings which did shewe and signifie that we vvere altogither defiled amp uncleane secondly by the sacrifices that were daily offred for propitiation for our sinnes now christ was our suretie and paid euery iotte of the debt vvhich we shoulde haue paid and requiring the acquittance taketh the ceremoniall law and the curse of the morall law and nailes them to the crosse furthermore in the shewe of conquest the chariot is the crosse likewise for it was not onely a monument of victory but also a chariot of triumph and the captiues bound and pinioned which follow christ are principality and powers that is the deuill and his angells hell death and condemnation all which are as it were taken prisoners their armour and weapons are taken from them and they chained and bound ech to other the meditation of this point serueth to admonish vs to abandon all manner of sinne and to make conscience of euerie good duety if we will aright professe the gospell of christ for vvhen vve sinne we doe as it vvere pull christ out of his charriot of triumph and untie sathans bonds amp giue him weapons and as much as we can make him valiant and strong againe now for any man to make sathan and sinne valiant and strong against himselfe whereas christ hath weakened him and euen bruised his heade is no better then to become an enemie of the crosse of christ againe hereby vve are taught to pray unto god that our blind eyes may be opened that vve may discerne aright of the passion of christ it is a wonder to see how man are caried avvay with a liking of vaine shewes games and enterludes how they spend euen vvhole daies in beholding the and their money also that they may come to the places vvhere they are oh then how exceedingly ought our harts to be rauished with this mast admirable shevve in vvhich the son of god himselfe rides most gloriously in his chariot of triumph and leades his and our most cursed enemy captiue yes treades them under his foote this triumph is set forth unto us in the preaching of the gospell and may be seene of us all freely without money or money worth what wretches then shall we be if we suffer our heartes to be filled with earthly delights and in the meane season haue little or no desire to beholde with the eyes of our mind this goodly spectacle that is to be seene in the passion of christ that serues to reuiue and refresh our soules to life eternall thirdly if christ when he was most weake and base in the eyes of man did most of all triumph upon the crosse then euerie one of us must learne to say with the apostle paul god forbid that i should reioyce in any thing but in the crosse of christ iesus our lord that we may say this truely first of all we must labour to haue the benefite of the crosse of christ not onely in the remission but also in the mortification of our sinnes secondly wee must not be discomforted but rather reioyce and triumph therein a christian man can neuer haue greater honour then to suffer for the gospell of christ when god calleth him thereunto and therefore s paul setteth forth another most glorious shewe which all those must make that suffer any thing for god cause they must encounter with the world the flesh and the deuill and are placed as it were on a theater and in this conflict the beholders are man and angels yes the whole hoast of heauen and earth the umpire or iudge is god himselfe it will giue sentence of victorie on their side and so they shall ouercome we must not hereupon thrust our selues into danger but when it shall please god to call vs thereunto wee must thinke our selues highly honoured of him as when god sendeth losse of friends of substance or good name or any other calamitie wee must not dispaire or be ouer grieued but rather reioyce and addresse our selues then with our sauiour christ to make a triumph thus much of christes triumph and the passion of his crosse now followeth the second degree of his humiliation in these words and buried where we must consider these pointes i why it was needfull that christ should be buried ii who was the authour of this buriall iii the maner or preparation to his buriall iiii the place and time where and when he was buried of these in order for the first the causes are many but especially foure why christ was to be buried i that the truth and certentie of his death might be confirmed unto us and that no man might so much as imagine that his death was a fantasticall death or his body a fantasticall bodie for man use not to bury a liuing but a dead man or a man in shewe but a true man ii that his buriall might be vnto him a passage fro the estate of humiliation to the estate of exaltation which began in his resurrection and he could not haue risen againe if hee had not bene first buried iii that the outward humiliation in the forme of a servant which he tooke upon him might be continued upon him to the lowest degree of all and therefore it was not sufficient that hee should be crucified euen to death but being dead he must be also buried iiii christ vvas buried that he might not onely vanquish death on the crosse but euen after the maner of conquerours subdue him at his owne home and as it were plucke him out of his owne cabbin the authors of christs burial were ioseph of arimathea amp nichodemus who came to iesus by night now concerning them amp this their fact there are many things worthy to be considered in this place first of all they were disciples of christ and the difference betweene them and the rest is to be considered the other disciples though in number they were but few yet in the feast before his passio they openly followed him but when christ was to be arraigned amp the persecution of the church of the new testament began in him then iudas betraied him peter denied him amp the rest fled away yet euen at the same instant these two secret disciples of our sauiour christ ioseph of arimathea amp nicodemus take courage to themselues amp in time of daunger openly professe themselues to be christes disciples by an honourable and solemne buriall god no doubt opening their heartes and inabling them to doe so the like is to be seene in all ages since the passion of christ in the church of god in which man zealous for the gospell in peace haue beene timerous in persecution whereas weake ones haue stood out against their enimies euen unto death it self the reason is because god will huble those his servant which are often times indued with great measure of graces amp cotrariwise exalt amp strengthe the weake amp feeble amp the same no doubt will be found true among us if it should please god to send any new triall into the church of englad this serues to teach us to think charitably of those which are as yet but weake amog us amp with all in our profession to cary a low saile amp to think basely of our selues and in the whole course of our liues creep alow by the ground running on in feare amp trebling because the lord oftetimes humbles those that be strong amp giue courage amp strength to weake ones boldly to confesse his name secondly vvhereas these tvvo disciples haue such care of the buriall of christ we learne that it is our dutie to be carefull also for the honest amp solemne buriall of our brother the lorde him selfe hath comanded it thou article dust amp to dust thou shalt returne also the body of man are the good creatures of god yes the body of god children are the temples of the holy ghost and therefore there is good cause why they should be honestly laide in the earth and it vvas a curse and iudgement of god upon iehoiakim that he must not be buried but like a dead asse be dravvn amp cast out of the gates of ierusalem and so the lorde threatens a curse upon the moabites because they did not burie the king of edom but burnt his bones into lime and therefore it is a necessarie dutie one neighbour and friend to looke to the honest buriall of another hence it followes that the practise of spaine and italy and all popish country which is to keepe the parts of mens body amp such like relikes of saints unburied that they may be seene of me amp worshipped hath no warrant dust they are and to dust they ought to be returned furthermore the properties and vertues of both these man are seuerally to be considered and first to beginne with ioseph hee was a senatour a man of great account authoritie and reputation among the iewes it may seeme a strange thing that a man of such account would abase him selfe so much as to take downe the body of christ from the crosse it might haue bene an hinderance to him and a disgrace to his estate and calling as we see in these daies it would be thought a base thing for a knight to come to the place of execution and take dovvne a thiefe from the hand of the hangman to burie him but this noble senatour ioseph for the loue he bare to christ made no account of his state and calling neither did hee scorne to take upon him so base an office considering it was for the honor of christ where we learne that if vve truly loue christ and our hearts be set to beleeue in him we will neuer refuse to perform the basest seruice that may be for his honour nothing shall hinder vs it is further saide that he was a good man and a iust and also a rich man and the first appeareth in this that hee would neither consent to the counsell nor fact of the iewes in crucifying christ it is rare to finde the like man in these dayes from his example vve learne these lessons i that a rich man remaining a rich man may be a servant of god and also be saued for riches are the good blessings of god and in them selues doe no vvhit hinder a man in comming to christ but some will say christ himselfe saith it is easier for a cable to go through the eye of a needle as a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen ans it is to be understood of a rich man so long as he swelleth vvith a confidence in his vvealth but we know that if a cable be untwisted and drawen into small threeds it may be drawen through the eye of a needle so he that is rich let him denie himselfe abase himselfe and lay aside all confidence in himselfe in his riches and honour and be as it were made small as a tvvine threede and vvith this good senatour ioseph become the disciple of christ hee may enter into the kingdom of heaue but christ saith in the parable that riches are thorns which choke the grace of god ansvver it is true they are thornes in that subiect or in that man that putteth his trust in them not in their owne nature but by reason of the corruption of mans heart who maketh of them his god s john saith further that ioseph was a disciple of christ but yet a close disciple for feare of the ievves and this sheweth that christ is most readie to receiue them that come unto him though they come laden with manifold wants i say not this that any hereby should take boldnes to liue in their sinnes but my meaning is that though man be weake in the faith yet are they not to be dismayed but to come to christ who refuseth none that come to him draw nere to god saith s iames and hee will draw nere to you christ doeth not forsake any till they forsake him first lastly the h ghost saith of him that hee waited for the kingdome of god that is hee did beleeue in the messias to come amp therfore did waite daily till the time was come when the messias by his death amp passion should abolish the kingdome of sinne amp satan amp establish his own kingdom throughout the whole world the same is said of simeon that he was a good man amp feared god amp waited for the consolation of israell this was the most principall vertue of all that ioseph had and the very roote of all his goodnes amp righteousnes that he waited for the kingdome of god for it is the propertie of faith whereby wee haue confidence in the messias to change our nature amp to purifie the heart amp to make it bring forth works of righteousnesse there be many among us that can talke of christes kingdome amp of redemption by him amp yet make no coscience of sinne amp haue litle care to liue according to the gospell which they professe and all is because they doe not soundly beleeue in the messias and they waite not for the kingdome of heauen amp therefore there is no chaunge in them but we must labour to haue this affiance in the messias with ioseph and to wait for his second appearance that thereby wee may be made new creatures hauing the kingdome of sathan battered and beaten downe in us and the kingdome of god erected in our heartes touching nichodemus s john saith that he came to iesus by night many man build upon this example that it is lawful to be present at the masse so be it in the mean seaso we keepe our heartes to god and indeede such man are like nichodemus in that they labour to burie christ as much as they ca though now after his resurrectio he should not be buried againe but though nichodemus durst not openly at the first professe the name of christ yet after his death vvhen there is most daunger hee doeth and by this meanes reformeth his former doing thus much of the persons that buried christ the third thing to be obserued is the maner of christs buriall which standeth in these points first they take downe his body from the crosse secondly they winde it thirdly they lay it in a tombe fourthly the tombe is made sure of these in order first ioseph taketh downe the body of christ from the crosse whereon hee was executed but marke in what maner he doth it not on his owne head without leaue but he goeth to pilate and beggeth the body of christ amp asketh leaue to take it downe because the disposing of dead body was in pilates hand hee being deputy at that time wherby we learn that in all our dealings amp actios though they haue neuer so good an ende our dutie is to proceede as peaceably with all man as may be as s iames saith the wisdom that is from aboue is first pure then peaceable getle ampc againe this eacheth us that in all things which concerne the authoritie of the magistrate and belong unto him by the rule of god worde wee must attempt or doe whatsoeuer we doe by leaue and here we may see of what courses they take that beeing priuate man in this our church will notwithstanding take upon them to plante churches without the leaue of the magistrate being a christian prince hauing thus taken the body of christ downe they go on to wind it and ioseph for his part brought linnen cloth and nichodemus a mixture of myr he amp aloes to the quantitie of an hundred poundes for the honourable buriall of christ his winding was on this manner they wrapped his bodie hastily in linnen cloth sweete odours put thereto besides all this in the iewes burials there was embalming amp washing of the body but christs body was not p ram theol l c seems to be deceiued in that he puts christs buriall for his embalming and his descending into bell for his buriall or his lying in the graue embalmed or washed because they had no time to do it for the preparatio to the passeouer drew nere and wheras these me burie christ at their own cost amp charges we are taught to be like affected to the liuing mebers of christ when they want we must relieue amp comfort them liberally and freely it may here be demanded whether man may not be at cost in making funerals considering euen christ himselfe is with much cost buried ans the body of all deade man are to be buried in seemely amp honest maner amp if they be honorable they may be buried honorably yet now ther is no cause why mens body should be washed annointed amp embalmed as the vse was amog the iewes for they used embalming as a pledge amp signe of the resurrectio but now since christs comming we haue a more certen pledge therof euen the resurrection of christ himself amp therfore there is no cause why we should use embaulming and washing as the iewes did and the clause which is specified in saint matthew is not to be omitted that ioseph wrapped christs body in a cleane linnen cloth whereby we learne that howsoeuer the strange fashions fetched from spaine and italy are mostrous amp to be abho red yet seing the body of a ma is the creature of god therefore it must be arayed in cleanly maner amp in holy comelines paul requires that the minister of the gospell in all things be seemely or comely amp herein he ought to be a patterne of sobriety unto all man thirdly after they haue woud the body of christ they lay it in a tob amp lastly they make it sure closing it up with a stone rolled ouer the mouth of it also the iewes request pilat to seale it that none might presume to open it besides they set a band of soldiers to watch the tomb amp to keepe it that his bodie be not stolle away many reasons might be alledged of this their dealing but principally it came to passe by the providence of god that hereby he might confirme the resurrection of christ for whereas the iewes would neither be mooued by his doctrine nor by his workes amp miracles to beleeue he causeth this to be done that by the certenty of his resurrection hee might conuince them of hardnesse of heart and prooue that he was the son of god thus much of the maner of his buriall now followes the place where christ was buried in the place we are to mark things i that christ was laid in iosephs tomb wherby we may gather the greatnes of christs pouertie in that he had not so much groud as to make himself a graue in amp this must be a comfort to the members of christ that are in pouertie and it teacheth them if they haue no more but foode and raiment to be there with content knowing that christ their head and king hath cosecrated this very estate unto them secondly the tombe wherein christ was laide was a newe tomb wherein neuer any man lay before and it was the speciall appointment of god prouidence that it should be so because if any man had bene buried there aforetime the malitious iewes would haue pleaded that it was not christ that rose againe but some other thirdly we must obserue that this tombe was in a garden as the fall of man was in a garden amp as the apprehension of christ in a garde beyond the brooke cedron and here we must note the practise of a good man this garden vvas the place of iosephs delight amp holy recreation wherin he used to solace himselfe in beholding the good creatures of god yet in the same place doth he make his owne graue long before he dyed whereby it appeares that his recreation was ioyned with a meditatio of his end and his example must be followed of us true it is god hath giuen us his creatures not only for necessity but also for our lawful delight but yet our duty is to mingle therewith serious meditation and consideration of our last end it is a brutish part to vse the blessings and creatures of god and not at all to be bettered in regard of our last end by a further vse thereof the time when christ was buried vvas the euening wherein the sabbath vvas to begin according to the maner of the iewes which beganne their daies at sun setting from euening to euening according to that in genesis the evening and the morning was the first day now ioseph commeth a litle before euening amp beggeth the body of christ and burieth it where note that howsoeuer vve are not bound to keepe the sabbath so strictly as the iewes were yet vvhen we haue any busines or worke to be done of our ordinarie calling vve must not take a part of the lordes sabbath day to do it in but preuent the time amp doe it either before as ioseph did or after the sabbath this is litle practised in the world me think if they go to church before amp after noone to heare god worde then all the day after they may doe what they list and spend the rest of the time at their owne pleasure but the vvhole day is the lordes amp therefore must be spent wholly in his seruice both by publicke hearing of the word and also by priuate reading and meditation on the same to conclude the doctrine of christes buriall here it may be demanded how he was alwaies after his incarnation both god and man considering he was dead amp buried and therefore bodie and soule were sundred amp a dead ma seemes to be no man ansvv a dead man in his kinde is as true a man as a living man for though bodie and soule be not united by the bond of life yet are they united by a relation which the one hath to the other in the counsell and good pleasure of god and that as truly as man and vvoman remaine coupled into one flesh by a couenant of mariage though afterwarde they be distant a thousand miles asunder and by vertue of this relation euery soule in the day of iudgement shall be reunited to his owne bodie amp euery bodie to his own soule but there is yet a more straighter bond betweene the body amp soule of christ in his death amp burial for as when he was liuing his soule was a meane or bond to unite his godhead amp his bodie togither so whe hee was deade his verie godhead was a meane or middle bond to unite the bodie and soule and to say otherwise is to dissolue the hypostaticall union by vertue wherof christes body and soule though seuered ech fro other yet both were still ioyned to the godhead of the son the use and profite which may be made of christes buriall is two folde i it serueth to worke in us the buriall of all our sinnes knovve yee not saieth paul that all who haue beene baptised into christ have beene baptised into his death and are buried vvith him by baptisme into his death if any shall demaund how any man is buried into the death of christ the answere is this euery christian man and woman are by faith mystically united unto christ and made all members of one body whereof christ is the head now therefore as christ by the power of his godhead when he was dead and buried did ouercome the graue amp the power of death in his own person so by the very same power by means of this spirituall coniunctio doth he worke in all his members a spirituall death amp buriall of sinne and naturall corruption when the israelites were burying of a ma for feare of the soldiers of the moabites they cast him for hast into the sepulchre of elisha now the dead man so soone as he was down amp had touched the body of elisha he revived amp stood upon his feet so let a man that is dead in sin be cast into the graue of christ that is let him by faith but touch christ dead amp buried it will come to passe by the vertue of christs death amp buriall that he shalbe raised fro the death amp bodage of sin to become a new ma secodly the buriall of christ serues to be a sweet perfume of all our graues and burials for the graue in it selfe is the house of perditio but christ by his burial hath as it were cosecrated and perfumed all our graues amp in stead of houses of perdition hath made them chambers of rest amp sleepe yes beds of downe amp therfore howsoeuer to the eye of ma the beholding of a funerall is terrible yet if we could then remember the buriall of christ amp consider how he thereby hath changed the nature of the graue euen then it woulde make us to reioice lastly we must imitate christs buriall in being cotinually occupied in the spiritual burial of our sins thus much of the buriall now followeth the third and last degree of christes humiliation he descended into hell it seemes very likely that these wordes were not placed in the creed at the first or as some thinke that they crept in by negligence because aboue threescore creeds of the most ancient councels amp fathers want this clause amp among the rest the nicene creed but if the ancient amp learned fathers assembled in that councel had bin perswaded or at the least had imagined that these words had bin set down at the first by the apostles no doubt they would not in any wise haue left them out and an anciet writer saith directly that these words he descended into hell are not found in the creede of the romane church nor used in the churches of the east amp if they be that then they signifie the burial of christ and it must not seeme strange to any that a worde or twaine in processe of time should creepe into the creede considering that the originall copies of the bookes of the old and new testament haue in them sundry v rias lectiones varieties of readings and ma jeremie for zachary words otherwhiles which from the margine haue crept into the text neuerthelesse considering that this clause hath long continued in the creed and that by common consent of the catholicke church of god amp it may carry a fit sense amp expositio it is not as some would haue it to be put forth therfore that we may come to speak of the meaning of it we must know that it hath usual expositios which we wil rehearse in order amp then make choise of that which shal be thought to be the fittest the first is that christs soule after his passion vpon the crosse did really amp locally descend into the place of the damned but this seems not to be true the reasons are these i all the evangelists and among the rest s luke intending to make an exact narration of the life and death of christ haue set downe at large his passion death buriall resurrection amp ascension and withall they make rehearsall of small circumstances therefore no doubt they woulde not haue omitted christes locall descent into the place of the damned if there had bene any such thing and the end why they penned this historie was that we might beleeue that iesus is christ the son of god amp beleeuing we might haue life euerlasting now there could not haue bene a greater matter for the confirmation of our faith the this that iesus the son of mary who went downe to the place of the damned returned thence to liue in happinesse for euer ii if christ did go into the place of the damned then either in soule or in body or in his godheade but his godhead could not descend because it is euery where and his bodie was in the graue and as for his soule it went not to hell but presently after his death it went to paradise that is the third heauen a place of ioy amp happines luke this day shalt thou be with me in paradise which vvordes of christ must be understood of his manhood or soule amp not of his godhead for they are an answer to a demad amp therfore unto it they must be sutable now the thief seeing that christ was first of all crucified amp therfore in all likelihood first of all die makes his request to this effect lorde thou shalt shortly enter into thy kingdome remeber me then to which christes answere as the very words import is thus much i shall enter into paradise this day amp there shalt thou be with me now there is no entrance but in regard of his soule or manhood for the godhead which is at all times in all places ca not be said properly to enter into a place again when christ saith thou shalt be with me in paradise he doeth intimate a resemblace which is betweene the first amp secod adam the first ada sinned against god amp was presently cast foorth out of paradise christ the second adam hauing made a satisfactio for sinne must immediatly enter into paradise now to say that christ in soule descended locally into hell is to abolish this analogie betvvene the first amp second adam iii ancient councels in their confessions and creeds omitting this clauseshew that they did not acknowledge any reall descent and that the true meaning of these words he descended was sufficiently included in some of the former articles amp that may appeare because when they set downe it they omit some of the former as athanasius in his creed setting downe these words he descended ampc omits the buriall putting them both for one as he expounds himselfe li de incar chrys homily amp in symb else where now let us see the reasons which may be alledged to the contrary ob i mat the son of man shall be dayes amp nights in the heart of the earth that is in hell ans i this exposition is directly against the scope of the place for the pharisies desired to see a signe that is some sensible amp manifest miracle amp hereunto christ answeres that he will giue them the signe of ionas which ca not be the descent of his soule into the place of the daned which is impossible but rathet his buriall amp after it his manifest amp glorious resurrectio ii the hart of the earth may as wel signify the graue as the center of the earth for thus tyrus bordering upon the sea is said to be in the heart of the sea iii this exposition takes it far granted that hell is seated in the middest of the earth wheras the scriptures reveale unto us no more but this that hell is in the lower parts but wher these lower parts should be no man is able to define obiect ii act thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption answer these wordes can not prooue any locall descent of christs soule for peters drift in alleadging of them is to prooue the resurrection and he saith expressely that the wordes must be vnderstoode of the resurrection of christ verse he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ what namely these words his soule was not left in hell ampc nowe there is no resurrection of the soule but of the bodie onely as the soule cannot be said to fall but the bodie it will be replied that the word cannot signifie the bodie and the word the graue answer the first word signifies not onely the spirituall part of man the soule but also the whole person or the man himselfe rom corinthian and the second is as well taken for the graue as for hell apocrypha death and are cast into the lake of fire nowe we can not say that hell is cast into hell but the graue into hell and the word in this text must needes haue this sense for peter makes an opposition betw eene the graue into which dauid is shut vp and the hell out of which christ was deliuered verse amp againe it will be saide that in this text there be two distinct parts the first of the soules comming forth of hell in these words thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell the second of the body rising out of the graue in the next words neither wilt thou suffer my flesh to see corruption answer it is not so for flesh in this place signifies not the bodie alone but the humane nature of christ as appeares verse vnlesse we shall say that one and the same word in the same sentence is taken two waies and the words rather carrie this sense thou wilt not suffer me to continue long in the graue nay which is more in the time of my continuance there thou wilt not suffer me so much as to feele any corruption because i am thy holy one obiect iii pet christ was quickned in spirit by the which spirit he went and preached to the spirits which are in prison answer the place is not for this purpose for by spirit is ment not the soule of christ but his godhead which in the ministerie of noe preached repentance to the olde world and i thinke that peter in this place alludes to another place in genesis where the lord saith my spirit shall not alwaies striue with man because he is but flesh and if the spirit doe signifie the soule then christ was quickned either by his soule or in his soule but neither is true for the first it can not be said that christ was quickened by his soule because it did not ioyne it selfe to the bodie but the godhead ioyned them both neither was he quickened in soule for his soule died not it could not die the first death which belongs to the bodie and it did not die the second death which is a totall separation from god onely it suffered the sorrowes of the second death which is the apprehension of the wrath of god as a man may feele the pangs of the first death and yet not die the first death but liue againe it is to no ende that christs soule should goe to hell to preach considering that it was neuer heard of that one soule should preach to another especially in hell where all are condemned and in conscience convicted of their iust damnation and where there is no hope of repentance or redemption it will be answered that this preaching is onely reall or experimentall because christ shews himselfe there to conuince the vnbeleefe of his enemy answer this which is said is flat against reason for when a man is iustly condemned by god and therfore sufficiently convicted what neede the iudge himselfe come to the place of executio to conuict him and it is flat against the text for the preaching that is spoken of here is that which is performed by man in the ministerie of the word as peter expounds himselfe pet to this purpose was the gospell also preached vnto the deade that they might be condemned according to man in the flesh that they might liue according to god in the spirit lastly there is no reason why christ should rather preach and shew himselfe in hell to them that were disobedient in the daies of noe then to the rest of the damned and this is the first exposition the second follows he descended into hell that is christ descended into the graue or was buried this exposition is agreeable to the truth yet is it not mee or conuenient for the clause next before he was buried cotained this point amp therfore if the next words following yeelde the same sense there must be a vaine and needelesse repetition of one and the same thing twise which is not in any wise to be allowed in so short a creede as this if it be said that these wordes are an exposition of the former the answeare is that then they should be more plaine then the former for when one sentence expoundeth an other the latter must alwaies be the plainer but of these two sentences he was buried he descended into hell the first is very plaine and easie but the latter very obscure and hard and therefore it can be no exposition thereof and therefore this exposition also is not to be receiued thirdly others there be which expound it thus he descended into hell that is christ iesus when he was dying vpon the crosse felt and suffered the pangs of hell and the full wrath of god seazing vpon his soule this exposition hath his warrant in god worde where hell often signifieth the sorrowes and paines of hell as hanna in her song vnto the lord saith the lorde killeth and maketh aliue he bringeth downe to hell and raiseth vp that is he maketh man feele woe and miserie in their soules euen the pangs of hell and after restoreth them and dauid saith the sorrowes of death compassed me and the terrours of hell laide holde on mee this is an vsuall exposition receiued of the church and they which expounde this article thus giues this reason thereof the former wordes was crucified deade and buried doe containe say they the outward sufferings of christ nowe because he suffered not onely outwardly in bodie but also inwardly in soule therefore these words he descended into hell doe set forth vnto vs his inwarde sufferings in soule when he felt vpon the crosse the ful wrath of god vpo him this exposition is good and true and whosoeuer will may receiue it but yet neuerthelesse it seemes not so fitly to agree with the order of the former articles for these words was crucified dead and buried must not be vnderstood of any ordinarie death but of a cursed death in which christ suffered the full wrath of god euen the pangs of hell both in soule and bodie seeing then this exposition is contained in the former words it cannot fitly stand with the order of this short creede vnlesse there should be a distinct article of things repeated before but let vs come to the fourth exposition he descended into hell that is when he was dead and buried he was held captiue in the graue and lay in bondage vnder death for the space of three daies this exposition also may be gathered forth of the scriptures saint peter saith god hath raised him vp speaking of christ and loosed the sorows of death because it was vnpossible that he should be holden of it where we may see that betweene the death and resurrection of christ there is placed a third matter which is not mentioned in any clause of the apostles creede saue in this and that is his bondage vnder death which commeth in betweene his death and rising againe and the words themselues doe most fitly beare this sence as the speach of iacob sheweth i will goe downe into o the graue gen hell vnto my son mourning and this exposition doth also best agree with the order of the creed first he was crucified amp died secodly he was buried thirdly laid in the graue and was therein held in captiuitie and bondage vnder death and these three degrees of christs humiliation are most fitly correspondent to the three degrees of his exaltation the first degree of his exhaltation he rose againe the third day answearing to the first degree of his humiliatio he died the second degree of his exhaltatio he ascended into heauen answering to his going downe into the graue was buried and thirdly his sitting at the right hand of god which is the highest degree of his exhaltation answearing to the lowest degree of his humiliation he descended into hell these two last expositions are commonly receiued and we may indifferently make choice of either but the last as i take it is most agreeable to the order and words of the creede thus much for the meaning of the words now follow the vses and first of all christs descending into hell teacheth euery one of vs that professe the name of christ that if it shall please god to afflict vs either in bodie or in minde or in both though it be in most grieuous and tedious manner yet must we not thinke it strange for christ vpon the crosse not onely suffered the pangs of hell but after he was dead death takes him and as it were carries him into his denne or cabbin and there triumpheth ouer him holding him in captiuitie and bondage and yet for all this was he the son of god and therefore when god hande is heauie vpon vs any way we are not to despaire but rather thinke it is the good pleasure of god to frame and fashion vs that we may become like vnto christ iesus as good children of god dauid a man after god owne heart was by samuel annointed king ouer israel but withall god raised vp saul to persecute him as the fowler hunteth the partridge in the mountaine in so much that dauid said there was but one step betweene him amp death so likewise iob a iust man and one that feared god with all his heart yet how heauily did god lay his hand vpon him his goods and cattell were all taken away and his owne children slaine and his owne bodie striken by satan with loathsome biles from the sole of his foote vnto the crowne of his head so as he was faine to take a potsheard and scrape himselfe sitting amog the ashes and ionah the servant and prophet of the most high god when he was called to preach to ninivie because he refused for feare of that great citie god mette with him and he must be cast into the sea and there be swallowed vp of a whale that so he might chastice him and thus doth he deale with his owne servant to make them conformable to christ and further when it pleaseth god to lay his hand vpon our soules and make vs haue a troubled and distressed conscience so as we doe as it were struggle with god wrath as for life and death and can finde nothing but his indignation seazing vpon our soules which is the most grieuous and perplexed estate that any man can be in in this case howsoeuer we cannot discerne or see any hope or comfort in our selues yet we must not thinke it strange nor quite despaire of his mercie for the son of god himselfe descended into hell and death carried him captiue and triumphed ouer him in the graue and therefore though god seeme to be our vtter enemie yet we must not despaire of his helpe in diverse psalmes we reade howe dauid was not onely persecuted outwardly of his enemy but euen his sou e and conscience were perplexed for his sinnes so as his bones were consumed within him and his moysture was turned into the drought in sommer this caused iob to cry out that the arrowes of god were within him and the venyme thereof did drinke vp his spirit the terrours of god did fight against him and the griefe of his soule was as waightie as the sand of the sea by reason whereof he saith that the lord did make him a marke and a butte to shoote at and therefore when god shall thus afflict vs either in bodie or in soule or in both we must not alwaies thinke that it is the wrathfull hand of the lord that begins to bring vs to vtter condemnation for our sinnes but rather his fatherly worke to kill sinne in vs and to make vs grow in humilitie that so we may become like vnto christ iesus secondly whereas christ for our sakes was thus abased euen vnto the lowest degree of humiliation that can be it is an example for vs to imitate as christ himselfe prescribeth learne of me that i am meeke and lowly and that we may the better doe this we must learne to become nothing in our selues that we may be all in all forth of our selues in christ we must loath and thinke as basely of our selues as may be in regard of our sinnes christ iesus vpon the crosse was content for our sakes to become a worme and no man as dauid saith which did chiefely appeare in this lowest degree of his humiliation when as death did as it were tread on him in his denne and the same minde must likewise be in vs which was in him the liking that we haue of our selues must be meere nothing but all our loue and liking must be forth of our selues in the death and bloode of christ and thus much of this clause as also of the state of christs humiliation nowe followeth his second estate which is his exaltation into glorie set down in these words the third day he rose againe from the deade ampc and of it we are first to speake in generall then in particular according to the seuerall degrees thereof in generall the exaltation of christ is that glorious or happie estate into which christ entred after he had wrought the worke of our redemption vpon the crosse and he was exalted according to both natures in regard of his godhead and also of his manhood the exaltation of the godhead of christ was the manifestation of the glorie of his godhead in the manhoode some will peraduenture demaunde how christs godhead can be exalted seeing it admits no alteration at all answer in it selfe it cannot be exalted yet beeing considered as it is ioyned with the manhood into one person in this respect it may be said to be exalted and therefore i say the exaltation of christs godhead is the manifestation of the glorie thereof in the manhood for though christ from his incarnation was both god and man and his godhead dwelt in his manhood yet from his birth vnto his death the same godhead did little shew it selfe and in the time of his suffering did as it were lie hid vnder the vaile of his flesh as the soule doth in the bodie when a man is sleeping that thereby in his humane nature he might suffer the curse of the law and accomplish the worke of redemption for vs in the low and base estate of a servant but after this worke was finished he began by degrees to make manifest the power of his godhead in his manhood and in this respect his godhead may be saide to be exalted the exaltation of christs humanitie stoode in two things the first that he laide downe all the infirmities of mans nature which he carried about him so long as he was in the state of a servant in that he ceased to be wearie hungrie thirstie ampc here it may be demaded whether the skarres amp wouds remain in the bodie of christ now after it is glorified ans some think that they doe remain as testimonies of that victorie which christ obtained of his amp our enemy amp that they are no deformitie to the glorious bodie of our lord but are themselues also in him in some vnspeakable manner glorified but indeede it rather seemes to be a truth to say that they are quite abolished because they were a part of that ignominious and base estate in which our sauiour was vpon the crosse which after his entrance into glorie he laid aside and if it may be thought that the woundes in the hands and feete of christ remaine to be seene euen to the last iudgement why may we not in the same manner thinke that the vaines of his bodie remaine emptied of their blood because it was shed vpon the crosse the second thing required in the exaltation of christs manhood is that both his bodie and soule were beautified and adorned with all qualities of glorie his minde was inriched with as much knowledge and vnderstanding as can possibly befall any creature and more in measure then all man and angels haue and the same is to be said of the graces of the spirit in his wil and affections his bodie also was incorruptible and it was made a shining bodie a resemblance whereof some of his disciples sawe in the mount and it was indued with agilitie to mooue as well vpward as downeward as may appeare by the ascension of his bodie into heauen which was not caused by constraint or by any violent motion but by a propertie agreeing to all body glorified yet in the exaltation of christs manhood we must remember two caveats first that he did neuer lay aside the essentiall properties of a true bodie as length breadth thicknes visibilitie locallitie which is to be in one place at once and no more but keepeth all these still because they serue for the beeing of his bodie secondly wee must remember that the gifts of glorie in christs bodie are not infinite but finite for his humane nature beeing but a creature and therefore finite could not receiue infinite graces and gifts of glorie and hence it is more then manifest that the opinion of those man is false which hold that christs bodie glorified is omnipotent and infinite euery way able to doe whatsoeuer he will for this is to make a creature to be the creator thus much of christs exaltation in generall now let vs come to the degrees thereof as they are noted in the creede which are in number three i he rose againe the third day ii he ascended vnto heauen iii he sitteth at the right hand of god the father almightie in the handling of christs resurrection we must consider these points i why christ ought to rise againe ii the manner of his rising iii the time when he rose iv the place where v the vses thereof for the first it was necessarie that christ should rise againe and that for three especiall causes first that hereby he might shew to all the people of god that he had fully ouercome death for els if christ had not risen how should we haue bin perswaded in our cosciences that he had made a full amp perfect satisfactio for vs nay rather we should haue reasoned thus christ is not risen amp therefore he hath not ouercome death but death hath ouercome him secondly christ iesus which died was the son of god therefore the author of life it selfe and for this cause it was neither meet nor possible for him to be holde of death but he must needes rise from death to life thirdly christs priesthood hath parts one to make satisfaction for sinne by his one onely sacrifice vpon the crosse the other to apply the vertue of this sacrifice vnto euery beleeuer now he offred the sacrifice for sinne vpon the crosse before his death and therefore beeing deade must needes rise againe to performe the second part of his priesthood namely to applie the vertue thereof vnto all that shall beleeue in him and to make intercession in heauen vnto his father for vs here on earth and thus much of the first point nowe to come to the manner of christs resurrection fiue things are to be considered in it the first that christ rose againe not as euery priuate man doth but as a publike person representing all man that are to come to life eternall for as in his passion so also in his resurrection he stood in our roome and place and therefore when he rose from death we all yes the whole church rose in him and together with him and this point not considered we doe not conceiue aright of christs resurrection neither can we reap sound comfort by it the second is that christ himselfe and no other for him did by his owne power raise himselfe to life this was the thing which he meant when he said destroy this temple amp in three daies i will build it vp againe amp more plainly i haue saith he power to lay down my life and i haue power to take it again fro whece we learn diverse instructions first wheras christ raiseth himselfe from death to life it serueth to proue that he was not only ma but also true god for the body being dead could not bring again the soule amp ioyn it self vnto the same amp make it selfe aliue againe neither yet the soule that is departed from the bodie can returne againe amp quicken the bodie and therefore there was some other nature in christ namely his godhead which did revnite soule and bodie together and thereby quickned the manhoode secondly if christ giue life to himselfe being dead in the graue then much more now being aliue and in heauen glorified is he able to raise vp his members from death to life we are all by nature starke dead in sinne as the dead bodie rotten in the graue and therfore our dutie is to come to christ our lord by praier intreating him that he would raise vs vp euery day more and more from the graue of our sinnes to newnes of life he can of man dead in their sinnes make vs aliue vnto himselfe to liue in righteousnes and true holines all the daies of our life the third thing is that christ rose againe with an earthquake and this serueth to prooue that he lost nothing of his power by death but still remained the absolute lord of heauen and earth to whome therefore the earth vnder his feete trembling doth him homage this also prooueth vnto vs that christ which lay dead in the graue did raise himselfe againe by his owne almightie power lastly it serueth to conuince the keepers of the graue the woman which came to embaulme him and the disciples which came to the sepulchre amp would not yet beleue that he was risen againe but how came this earthquake answer saint matthew saith there was a great earthquake for the angell of the lord descended from heauen ampc this shewes that the power of angels is great in that they can mooue and stirre the earth three angels destroied sodom amp gomorha an angel destroied the first borne of egypt in one ight in the host of senacherib one angel slue in one night me of like power is the devil himself to shake the earth and to destroy vs all but that god of his goodnes limits amp restrains him of his libertie well if one angel be able to shake the earth what then wil christ himselfe do when he shal come to iudgemet the secod time with many thousand thousads of angels oh how terrible will his comming be not without cause saith the holy ghost that the wicked at that day shall cry out wishing the hills to fall vpon them and the mountains to couer them for feare of that great and terrible day of the lord the thing is that an angel ministred to christ being to rise again in that he came to the graue amp rolled away the stone amp sate vpo it where obserue first how the angels of god minister vnto christ though dead amp buried whereby they acknowledge that his power maiestie amp authoritie is not included within the bondes of the earth but extends it selfe euen to the heauens themselues and the hosts thereof and that according to his humanitie wicked man for their parts laboured to close him vp in the earth as the bases of all creatures but the angels of heauen most readily accept him as their soueraigne lord and king as in like manner they did in his temptation in the wildernes and in his agonie in the garden secondly that the opinion of the papists and others which think that the bodie of christ went through the graue stone when he rose againe is without warrant for the ende no doubt why the angel rolled away the stone was that christ might come foorth and indeede it is against the order of nature that one bodie should passe through another without corruption or alteration of either considering that euery bodie occupies a place and two body at the same instat canot be in one proper place furthermore it is said that when the angel sate on the stone his countenance was like lightening and his rayment as white as snow amp this serued to shew what was the glory of christ himselfe for if the servant and minister be so glorious then endlesse is the glorie of the lord and master himselfe lastly it is said that for feare of the angel the watchmen were astonied and became as dead man which teacheth vs that what god would haue come to passe all the world can neuer hinder for though the iewes had closed vp the graue with a stone and set a band of souldiours to watch least christ should by any meanes be taken away yet all this auaileth nothing by an angel from heauen the seale is broken the stone is remooued and the watchmen at their wittes ends and this came to passe by the prouidence of god that after the watchmen had testified these things to the iewes they might at length be conuicted that christ whome they crucified was the messias the fifth amp last point is that christ rose not alone but accompanied with others as s matthew saith that the graues opened and many body of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graues and went into the holy citie and appeared vnto many after christs resurrection and this came to passe that the church of god might know amp consider that there is a reuiuing and quickening vertue in the resurrection of christ wherby he is able not only to raise our dead body vnto life but also when wee are deade in sinne to raise vs vp to newnes of life and in this very point stands a maine difference between the resurrection of christ amp the resurrection of any other man for the resurrection of peter nothing auailes to the raising of dauid or paul but christs resurrection auailes for all that haue beleeued in him by the very same power whereby he raised himselfe he raiseth all his members amp therefore he is called a quickening spirit and let vs marke the order obserued in rising first christ riseth amp then the saints after him and this came to passe to verifie the scripture which saith that christ is the first borne of the dead now he is the first borne of the dead in that hee hath this dignitie amp priuiledge to rise to eternal life the first of all man it is true indeede that lazarus amp sundrie others in time rose before christ but yet they rose to liue a mortall life and to die againe christ he is the first of all that rose to life euerlasting and to glorie neuer any rose before christ in this maner and the persos that rose before with christ are to be noted they were the saints of god not wicked man whereby we are put in minde that the elect children of god onely are partakers of christs resurrection indeede both good and bad rise againe but there is a great difference in their rising for the godly rise by the vertue of christs resurrection and that to eternall glorie but the vngodly rise by the vertue of christ not as he is a redeemer but as he is a terrible iudge and is to execute iustice on them and they rise againe for this ende that besides the first death of the bodie they might suffer the second death which is the powring forth of the wrath of god vpon bodie and soule eternally this difference is prooued vnto vs by that which paul saith christ is the first fruits of them that sleep among the iewes such as had corne fields gathered some little quantitie therof before they reaped the rest amp offred the same vnto god signifying therby that they acknowledged him to be the author and giuer of all increase amp this offer was also an assurance vnto the owner of the blessing of god vpo the rest amp this being but one handful did sactify the whol crop now christ to the dead is as the first fruits to the rest of the corne because his resurrection is a pledge amp an assurance of the resurrection of all the faithfulll when a man is cast into the sea and all his bodie is vnder the water there is nothing to be looked for but present death but if he carrie his heade aboue the water there is good hope of a recouery christ himself is risen as a pledge that all the iust shall rise againe he is the heade vnto his church amp therfore all his members must needes followe in there time it may be demaded what became of the saints that rose againe after christs resurrection ans some think they died againe but seeing they rose for this ende to manifest the quickning vertue of christs resurrection it is as like that they were also glorified with christ and ascended with him to heauen thus much of the manner of christs resurrection now follows the time when he rose againe and that is specified in the creede the third day he rose againe thus saith our sauiour christ vnto the pharisies as ionas was three daies and three nights in the whale bell e so shall the son of man be three daies and three nights in the heart of the earth and though christ was but one day and two pieces of two daies in the graue for he was buried in the euening before the sabbath and rose in the morning the next day after the sabbath yet is this sufficient to verifie this saying of christ for if the analogie had stoode in three whole daies then christ should haue risen the fourth day and it was the pleasure of god that he should lie thus long in the graue that it might be knowne that he was thoroughly dead and he continued no longer that he might not in his bodie see corruption againe it is said christ rose againe in the ende of the sabbath when the first day of the weeke beganne to dawne and this very time must be considered as the reall beginning of the new spirituall world in which we are made the sonnes of god and as in the first day of the first world light was commaunded to shin out of darknes vpon the deepes so in the first day of this new world the son of righteousnes riseth and giues light to them that sit in darknes amp dispells the darknes that was vnder the old testamet and here let vs mark the reason why the sabbath day was changed for the first day of the weeke which was the day following the iewes sabbath is our sabbath day which day we keepe holy in memorie of the glorious resurrection of christ and therefore it is called the lord day and it may not vnfitly be tearmed hierome sunday though the name came first from the heathen because on this day the blessed son of righteousn s rose from death to life let vs now in the next place proceede to the proofes of christs resurrection which are diligently to be obserued because it is one of the most principall points of our religion for as the apostle saith he died for our sinnes and rose againe for our iustification and againe if christ be not risen then is our prea hing vaine and our faith is also vaine the proofes are of two sorts first christs appearances vnto man secondly the testimonies of man christs appearances were either on the first day or n the daies following the appearances of christ the same day he rose againe are fiue and first of all arely in the morning he appeared to marie magdalen in this appearance diverse things are to be considered the first of what note and qualitie the partie was to whome christ appeared answer mary magdalen was one that had beene possessed with seuen devil but was deliuered and became a repentant sinner and stoode by when christ suffered and came with sweete odours when he was dead to embaulme him and therefore to hir is graunted this prerogatiue that shee should be the first that should testifie his resurrection vnto man and hence we learne that christ is readie and willing to receiue most miserable wretched sinners euen such as haue beene vassa ls and bondslaues of the deuill if they will come to him any man would thinke it a fearefull case to be thus possessed with deuills as marie was but let all those that liue in ignorance and by reason thereof liue in sinne without repentance know this that their case is a thousand times worse then marie magdalen was for what is an impenitent sinner surely nothing els but the castle amp hold of the deuill both in bodie amp soule for looke as a captaine that hath taken some hold or skonse doth rule amp gouerne all therein and disposeth of it at his wil amp pleasure euen so it is with all blinde and impenitent sinne s not one deuill alone but euen legions of deuills possesse them amp rule their hearts amp therfore howsoeuer they may sooth themselues amp say all is well for god is mercifull yet their case is farre worse then mari s was now then would any be freed from this feareful bondage let them learne of marie magdalen to follow christ and to seeke vnto him and then albeit the deuill and all his angels possesse their hea ts yet christ beeing the strong man will come and cast them all out and dwell there himselfe the second is what christ in his appearance saide to marie answer he said touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father mary no doubt was glad to see christ amp therfore looked to haue coversed as familiarly with him as shee was wont before his death but he forbids her to touch him that is not to look to inioy his corporal presence as before but rather to seeke for his spirituall presence by faith considering he was shortly to ascend to his father for this cause when he appeared to his disciples he staied not long with them at any time but onely to manifest himselfe vnto the thereby to prooue the certentie of his resurrection this prohibition shows first of all that it is but a fond thing to delight in the outward picture and portraiture of christ as the iesuits doe who stand much vpo his outward forme and lineaments secondly it ouerthroweth the popish crucifixes and all the carued and molten images of christ wherein the papists worship him for corporall presence is not now required therefore spirituall worship onely must be giuen vnto him thirdly it ouerthroweth the reall presence of christ in the sacrament many are of minde that they cannot receiue christ except they eat amp drink his bodie amp blood corporally but it is not much materiall whether we touch him with the bodily hand or no so be it we apprehend him spiritually by faith lastly as we must not haue earthly considerations of christ so must we on the cotrarie labour for the spiritual hand of faith which may reach vp it selfe to heauen amp there lay hold on him this is the very thing which christ insinuateth vnto mary in saying touch me not and s paul saith henceforth know we no man after the flesh yes though we had knowne christ after the flesh yet now know we him no more that is we know him no more as a man liuing among vs amp therfore he addes if any ma be in christ he is a new creature and this new creation is not by the bodily presence of christ but by the apprehesio of faith the second appearance was to marie magdalen amp to the other marie as they were going from the graue to tell his disciples at which time christ meeteth them amp bids them go tell his brethre that he is risen again and wheras christ sendeth wome to his disciples he purposed hereby to check the for their vnbeliefe for these wome forsooke him not at his death but stood by amp saw him suffer amp whe he was buried they came to embalme him but all this while what became of christs disciples surely peter denied him amp al the rest fled away eue iames amp john the sonnes of thuder saue that john stood a loofe to behold his death herupon christ to make the ashamed of their fault sendeth these woman unto them to publish that to them which they by their calling ought aboue all other to haue published secondly this teacheth that whereas christ buildeth his kingdome amp publisheth his gospell by apostles euangelists pastors teachers hee can if it so please him perfourme the same by other meanes in this his second appearance he used weak and silly woman to publish his resurrection and thereby shewes that he is not bound to the ordinarie means which now hee useth thirdly hee sent them to his disciples to shew that howsoeuer they had dealt unfaithfully with him by forsaking him and denying him yet hee had not quite forsaken them but if they would repent and beleeue hee would receiue them into his loue and fauour againe and therefore calleth them his brother saying goe and tell my brother this teacheth us a good lesson that howsoeuer our sinnes past are to humble us in regard of our selues yet must they not cut us off or dismay us from seeking to christ yes euen then when we are laden with the burde of them we must come unto him amp he will ease us fourthly whereas silly woman are sent to teach christes disciples which were schollers brought up in his owne schoole wee are admonished that superioritie in place and calling must not hinder us sometime to heare and to be taught of our inferiours iob saieth he neuer refused the counsell of his servant and naaman the syrian obeyed the counsell of a silly maide which advised him to go to the prophet of the lorde in samaria to be cured of his eprosie and when he had beene with the prophet hee obeyed the counsell of his servant that perswaded him to doe all the prophet had said wash and be cleane now after that the woman are come to the disciples and make relation of christes resurrection the text saieth their words seemed as fained things unto them neither beleeved they them hence wee learne two things the first that man of themselues can not beleeue the doctrine of christia religion it is a harde matter for a man to beleeue sundrie things in the worke of creation the temporall deliuerance of the children of israell seemed to them as a dreame and the resurrection of christ euen to christes owne disciples seemed a fained thing the second that it is an hard thing truly and vnfainedly to beleeue the points of religion disciples brought up in the schoole of christ and often catechised in this very point of christs resurrection yet dull are they to beleeue it this confu eth and condemneth our carnall gospellers that make it the lightest and easiest thing that can be to beleeue in christ and therefore they say their faith is so strong that they would not for all the world doubt of god mercy whereas indeede they are deceiued and haue no faith at all but blind presumption the thirde appearance was on this manner as two of christes disciples were going from ierusalem to emmaus about threescore furlongs and talked togither of all the things that were done iesus drewe nere and talked with them but their eyes were holden that they could not know him and as they went he communed with them amp prooued out of the scripture his resurrection expounding unto them all things that were written of him then they made him stay with them and their eyes were opened amp they knew him by breaking of bread but he was taken out of their sight in this notable appearance wee may obserue these foure points the first that christ held their eyes that they could not know him they saw a man indeed but who he was they could not tell by this it is more then manifest that the use of our outwarde senses as seeing feeling smelling ampc is supplied vnto us continually by the power of christ and therefore euen in these things we must acknowledge the continuall goodnes of god now if one man can not so much as discerne another but by the blessing of christ then shall we neuer be able to discerne the way of life from the way of death without him amp therfore we must pray unto god that he would giue us his holy spirite to enlighten the eyes of our understanding wherby we may be able to see and know the way that leadeth unto life and also to walke in the same the second that as christ vvas in expounding the scriptures vnto them their heartes burned within them by this we learne that howsoeuer the ministers of god publish the gospell to the outward eares of man yet is it the proper worke of christ alone to touch amp inflame the heart by the fire of his holy spirit amp to quicke amp raise man up to the life of righteousnes amp true holines it is he only that baptiseth with the holy ghost amp with fire amp it further admonisheth us that we should heare the worde preached fro the mouth of god ministers with burning amp melting hearts but alas the ordinary practise is flat cotrarie mens eies are drowsie amp heauie amp their hearts dead amp frozen within them amp that is the cause why after much teaching there followes but litle profit the thirde thing is that christ did eate with the tvvo disciples and was knowen of them in breaking of breade it is verie like that our sauiour christ did in some speciall maner blesse the bread which he brake wherby his disciples discerned him from others and in like maner we must by blessing our meates and drinkes distinguish our selues though not from such as are the servant of god yet from all ungodly amp carelesse man many being silent themselues do make their children to giue thankes and to blesse their meates and indeede it is a comendable thing if it be done sometimes to nourture the childe but for man to disburden themselues wholly of this duty is a fault and it is a shame that that mouth which openeth it selfe to receiue the good creatures of god should neuer ope it selfe to blesse amp praise god for the same therfore in this actio of eating and drin king let us shewe our selues followers of christ that as by blessing the same he was known from all other so we may also hereby distinguish our selues from the profane and wicked of this world otherwise what difference shal there be betwene us amp the very hog that eats mast on the groud but neuer lookes up to the tree from whence it falles and as christ reuealed himselfe unto his disciples at that time whe they caused him to eate meat with the so let us suffer christ to be our guest and let us entertaine him in his mebers amp no doubt he wil blesse us amp withal reueal himself unto us the fourth thing is that hauing eaten hee is taken out of their sight and this came to passe not because the bodie of christ became spirituall but because either he helde their eyes as before or he departed with celeritie and speede according to the propertie of a bodie glorified the fourth appearance of christ was to peter alone mentioned onely by s paul he was seene of ephas the fifth appearance was to all the disciples togither saue thomas in it we must consider three things which are all effectuall arguments to prooue christes resurrection the first that hee came and stoode in the middest among them the dores being shut now it may be demanded how this could be ans the papists say his body was glorified and so passed through the dore but as i haue said it is against the nature of a bodie that one should passe through another as heate doeth through a peece of iron both body remaining entire and sound therefore we may rather thinke that whereas christ came in when the dores were shut it was either because by his mightie power hee caused the dores to giue place the disciples not knowing how or else because he altered the verie substance of the dores that his body might passe through as hee thickened the water to carrie his bodie when he walked upon the sea now if this be true as very like it is that these dumbe creatures gaue place to christ and became pliable unto his commandement then much more ought we to carry hearts coformable and pliant to the will of our lord iesus in all his commaundements the second point is that when as the disciples thought christ to haue bene a spirit he to prooue the truth of his manhood sheweth unto them his handes and his feete and the wound in his side and calles for meat and eates it among them but it may be asked how this could be cosidering that a glorified body hath no blemish and needes not to eate but is supported by god without meate if this be true in our body when they shal be glorified then much more was it true in christ ans true it is a glorified bodie hath no blemishes but our sauiour christ had not yet entred into the fulnesse of gis glory if he had bene fully glorified he could not so sensibly and plainly haue made manifest the trueth of his resurrection vnto his disciples and therefore for their sakes and ours hee is content after his entrance into glorie still to retaine in his bodie some remnantes of the ignominies and blemishes which if it had pleased him hee might haue laide aside he is also content to eate not for neede but to prooue that his body was not a bodie in shew but a true bodie this teacheth us two lessons i if christ for our good and comfort be content to retaine these ignominious blemishes then answerably euery one of us must as good followers of christ referre the workes of our callings to the good of others as paul saith he was free from all man yet he was content to become all things vnto all man that by all meanes he might winne the moe secondly wee learne that for the good of our neighbour and for the maintaining of loue and charitie we must be content to yeelde from our owne right as in this place our sauiour christ yeeldes of his owne glorie for the good of his church the third point is that hee then gaue the disciples their apostolicall commissions saying goe and teach all nation of which three pointes are to be considered the first to whome it is giuen answer to them all as well to one as to another and not to peter onely and this ouerthrowes the fond and forged opinion of the papists concerning peters supremacie if his calling had bene aboue the rest then hee should haue had a speciall commission aboue the rest but one and the same commission is giuen alike to all the second that with the commission he giues his spirit for whom hee appointeth to publish his will and worde them he furnisheth with sufficient giftes of his holy spirit to discharge that great function and therefore it is a defect that any are set a parte to be ministers of the gospell of christ which haue not receiued the spirit of knowledge the spirit of wisdome and the spirite of prophesie in some measure the third point is that in conferring of his spirit he useth an outwarde signe for the text saith he breathed on them amp said receive the holy ghost the reasons hereof may be these first when god created adam and put into him a liuing soule it is said he breathed in his face and so our sauiour christ in giuing unto his disciples the holy ghost doeth the same to shewe unto them that the same person that giueth life giueth grace and also to signifie unto them that beeing to sende them ouer all the worlde to preach his gospell he was as it were to make a second creation of man by renuing the image of god in him which he had lost by the fall of adam againe hee breathed on them in giuing his spirite to put them in mind that their preaching of the gospell could not be effectuall in the hearts of their hearers before the lord doth breath into them his spirit amp therby draw them to beleeue amp therfore the spouse of christ desireth the lord to send forth his north and south wind to blovve on her garden that the spice thereof may flow out this garden is the church of god which desireth christ to comfort her amp to poure out the graces of his spirite on her that the people of god which are the hearbs and trees of righteousnes may bring forth sweet spice whose fruite may be for meate and their leaues for medicines thus much for the fiue appearances of christ the same day he rose againe now follow the rest of his appearances which were in the daies following which are in nuber sixe the first is mentioned by s john in these words eight daies after when the disciples were within amp thomas with the came iesus when the dores were shut amp stood in the midst of the amp said peace be unto you in it we must consider two things i the occasion thereof ii the dealing of christ the occasion was this after christ had appeared vnto the other disciples in thomas his absence they tolde him that they had seene the lorde but he made answere except i see in his body the print of his nailes amp put mine hand into his side i will not beleeve now eight dayes after our sauiour christ appeared againe unto all the disciples especially for the curing of thomas his unbeliefe which was no small sinne considering it containes in it three great sinnes the first is blindnes of mind for he had beene a hearer of our sauiour christ a long time and had bene instructed touching resurrection diverse times he was also with christ and saw him when he raised lazarus and had seene or at least wise had heard the miracles which he did and also he had heard all the disciples say that they had seene the lord and yet will it not sinke into his head the second is deadnesse of heart when our sauiour christ went to raise lazarus that vvas deade thomas spake verie confidently to him and saide let vs go that we may die with him yet when christ was crucified he fledde away and is the longest from christ after his resurrection and when he is certenly told thereof hee will not acknowledge it or yeeld unto it the third is willfulnesse for when the disciples told him that they had seen the lord he said flatly that unlesse he saw in his hands the print of the nailes he would not beleeue and that which is worse then all this he continueth eight daies in this wilfull minde now in this exceeding measure of unbeleefe in thomas any man euen hee that hath the most grace may see what a masse of unbeliefe is in himselfe and what willfulnesse and untowardnesse to any good thing in so much that we may truly say with dauid lorde what is man that thou so regardest him and if such measure of unbeliefe was in such man as the disciples were then we may assure our selues that it doth much more exceed in the common professours of religion in these daies let them protest to the contrarie what they will now the cause of his unbeliefe was this he makes a law to himselfe that he will see and feele or else he will not beleeue but this is flat against the nature of faith which consisteth neither in seeing nor feeling indeed in things natural a man must first haue experience in seeing and feeling and then beleeue but it is contrarie in diuinitie a man must first haue faith and beleeue and then comes experience afterward but thomas hauing not learned this doth ouershoote himselfe and herein also many deceiue themselues which thinke they haue no faith because they haue no feeling for the chiefest feeling that we must haue in this life must be the feeling of our sinnes amp the miseries of this life amp though we haue no other feeling at all yet wee must not therefore cease to beleeue in christs dealing with thomas we may consider three actions the first that he speakes to thomas alone and answeres him according to the verie wordes which hee had spoken of him in his absence and that word for word and by this he laboured to ouerthrow his unbeliefe and to conuince him that being absent he knew what he spake and by this we learne that though we want the bodily presence of christ hee beeing now in heauen yet hee knoweth well what we say and if need were could repeate all our sayings word by worde and if it were not so how could it be true that we must giue an account of euery idle word now this must teach us to looke that our speech be gratious according to the rule of god holy word secondly this must make us willing and cherefull to direct our praiers to christ considering hee knoweth what we pray for and heareth euerie word wee speake the second action is that christ condescends to thomas and giues him libertie to feele the printe of the nailes and to put his finger into his side hee might haue reiected thomas for his wilfulnesse yet to helpe his unbeliefe he yeeldeth unto his weakenesse this shevveth that christ is most compassionate to all hose that unfainedly repent them of their sinnes and cleaue unto him although they do it laden with manifold wants dauid saith that the lord hath compassion on all them that feare him as a father hath compassion on his children and he addes the reason for he knoweth of what we are made and the prophet isai he will not breake the bruised reed and smoking flax he will not quench when a child is verie sicke insomuch that it casteth up all the meate vvhich it taketh the mother will not be offended thereat but rather pitie it now our sauiour christ is ten thousande times more mercifull to them that beleeue in him then any mother is or can be the third action is that when thomas had seene and felte the wounds christ revived his faith whereupon he brake forth and said my lord and my god in which vvordes he doeth most notably bewaile his blindnesse and unbeliefe and as a fire that hath bene smothered so doth his faith burst foorth and shevv it selfe and in this example of thomas we may see the state of god people in this life first god giueth them faith yet afterward for a time he doth as it were hide the same in some corner of their hearts so as they haue no feeling thereof but thinke them selues to be voide of all grace and this hee doeth for no other end but to humble them and yet againe after all this the first grace is further renewed and reuiued thus dealt the lorde with dauid and salomon for whereas he was a pen man of scripture and therefore an holy man of god wee may not thinke that hee was wholly forsaken with peter and in this place with thomas and the experience of this shall euerie servant of god finde in himselfe the second appearance of christ was to seuen of the disciples as they went on fishing in which hee giues three testimonies of his godheade and that by death his power was nothing diminished the first that when the disciples had fished all night and caught nothing afterward by his direction they catch fish in abundance and that presently this teacheth vs that christ is a soueraigne lorde ouer all creatures and hath the disposing of them in his owne handes and that if good successe follow not when man are painefull in their callings it is because god will prepare and make them fitte for a further blessing christ comes in the morning and giues his disciples a great draught of fish yet before this can be they must labour all night in vaine ioseph must be made ruler ouer all egypt but first he must be cast into a dungeon where he can see no sun nor light to prepare him to that honour and dauid must be king ouer israell but the lorde will first prepare him hereunto by raising up saul to persecute him therefore when god sendeth any hinderances vnto us in our callings we must not despaire nor be discouraged for they are the meanes whereby god maketh us fitte to receiue greater blessings at his hand either in this life or in the life to come the second is that the nette was unbroke though it had in it great fish to the number of an hundred fifty three the third that when the disciples came to lande they sawe otte coles and fish laide thereon and bread now some may aske whence was this foode ansvver the same lorde that was able to prouide a whale to swallow up ionas and so to saue him and he that was able to prouide a fish for peters angle with a piece of tvventie pence in the mouth and to make a little bread and a fewe fish to feede so many thousands in the wildernesse the same also doeth of himselfe prouide bread and fish for his disciples this teacheth us that not onely the blessing but also the verie hauing of meate drinke apparell is from christ and hereupon all states of man euen the kings of the earth are taught to pray that god would giue them their daily bread againe when we sit downe to eate and drinke this must put us in minde that we are the guests of christ himselfe our food which wee haue comes of his meere gift and hee it is that entertaines us if we could see it and for this cause we must soberly and with great reuerence in feare and trembling use all god creatures as in his presence and when we eate and drinke wee must alwaies looke that all our speech be such as may beseeme the guestes of our lord and saviour iesus christ vsually the common practise of man is farre otherwise for in feasting many take libertie to surfette and to be drunke to svveare and to blaspheme but if wee serue the lorde let us remember whose guestes wee are and who is our entertainer and so behaue our selues as being in his presence that all our actions and wordes may tend to his glorie the thirde appearance was to iames as saint paul recordeth although the same be not mentioned in any of the euangelistes the fourth was to all his disciples in a mountaine whither he had appointed them to come the fift and last appearance was in the mount of olives when hee ascended into heauen of these three last appearances because the holy ghost hath only mentioned them i omit to speake and with the repeating of them i let them passe thus much of the appearances of christ after his resurrection the witnesses thereof are of three sortes i angels ii woman that came to the graue to embalme him iii christs owne disciples who did publish and preach the same againe according as they had seene and heard of our sauiour christ and of these likewise i omit to speake because there is not any specia l thing mentioned of them by the evangelistes now follow the uses which are twofold some respect christ and some respect ourselues vses which concerne christ are three i whereas christ iesus being starke deade rose againe to life by his owne power it serueth to prooue unto us that he was the son of god thus paul speaking of christ saieth that he was declared mightily to be the son of god touching the spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead and by the mouth of dauid god saide thou article my son this day i have begot thee which place must be understood not so much of the eternall generation of christ before all worlds as of the manifestation therof in time after this maner this day that is at the time of thine incarnation but especially at the day of thy resurrection have i begotten thee that is i haue made manifest that thou article my son so is this place expouded by s paul in the acts secondly christs resurrection by his own power prooues unto us euidently that he is lord ouerall things that are amp this use s paul makes hereof for saith he christ therefore died that he might be lord both of the dead and of the quicke and indeed wheras he rose againe thus he did hereby shew himselfe most plainely to be a mightie prince ouer the graue ouer death hell amp condemnation in that he had power to ouercome them thirdly it proues unto us that he was a perfit priest amp that his death and passion was a perfit satisfaction to the iustice of god for the sins of mankind for whereas christ died he died for our sins now if he had not fully satisfied for them all though there had remained but one sin for which he had made no satisfaction he had not risen againe but death which came into the worlde by sinne and is strengthned by it woulde haue helde him in bondage and therefore whereas hee rose againe it is more then manifest that he hath made so full a satisfaction so as the merite thereof doth and shall countervaile the iustice of god for all our offences to this purpose paul saith if christ be not risen againe your faith is vaine and you are yet in your sins that is christ had not satisfied for your sinnes or at least you could not possibly haue knowen that he had made satisfaction for any of them if he had not risen againe the uses which concerne our selues are of two sortes comforts to the children of god and duties that are to be learned and practised of us all the comforts are especially three first christs resurrrection serueth for the iustification of all that beleeue in him euen before god the father as paul saith christ was given to death for our sinnes and is risen againe for our iustification which wordes haue this meaning when christ died as we haue shewed before we must not consider him as a priuate man but as one that stood in the stead and roome of all the elect in his death he bare our sinnes and suffered all that we should haue suffered in our own persons for euer amp the guilt of our offences was laid upon him amp therfore esai saith he was nubred among the wicked now in his rising againe he freed amp disburdened himselfe not from any sinnes of his own because he was without sin but from the guilt amp punishment of our sins imputed unto him and hence it comes to passe that all those which put their trust amp affiance in the merit of christ at the very first instant of their beleeuing haue their owne sins not imputed unto them amp his righteousnes imputed secondly the resurrection of christ serueth as a notable meanes to worke inward sanctification as s peter saith we are regenerate to a lively hope by the resurrectio of iesus christ from the dead and s paul wee are then saith hee buried with him by baptisme into his death that like as christ vvas raised vp from the dead by the glorie of his father so vvee also should walke in newnesse of life for if we be grafted vvith him to the similitude of his death wee shall be also to the similitude of his resurrection which wordes import thus much that as christ by the power of his owne godheade freed his manhood from death and from the guilt of our sinnes so doth he free those that are knit unto him by the bond of one spirite from the corruption of their natures in which they are dead that they may liue unto god in the naturall body the head is the fountaine of all the senses and of motion and therefore by sundry nerves dispersed through the body the power of moouing and of sense is deriued euen to the least partes so as the hands and the feete moue by meanes of that power which comes from the head and so it is in the spirituall body of christ namely the church he is the head amp the fountain of life amp therfore he coveieth spirituall life to euery one of his members and that very power of his godhead whereby he raised up himselfe when he was dead he conveieth from himselfe to his members amp thereby raiseth them up from the death of sinne to newnesse of life and looke as in a perfect body when the head hath sence and motion the hand that is of the same bodie hath also sense and motion conuenient for it so likewise christ beeing the resurrection and the life as there is spirituall life in him so euery member of his shall feele in it selfe spirituall sence and motion whereby it is raised up fro sinne and liueth unto god for the better conceiuing of this we must consider two things the outward meanes of this spirituall life and the measure of it for the meanes if we will haue common water vve must goe to the well and if wee vvould haue vvater of life we must goe unto christ who saith if any man thirst let him come unto me and drinke now this vvell of the water of life is very deepe amp we haue nothing to draw with therefore we must haue our pipe amp conduits to convey the same unto us which are the word of god preached and the administration of the sacramets christ saith the dead shall heare the voice of the son of god amp they that heare it shall live where by dead is meant not the dead in the graue but those that are dead in sinne and againe christ saith the wordes which i speake are spirite and life because the word of god is the pipe whereby he conveieth into our dead hearts spirit and life as christ when he raised up dead man did onely speake the word amp they were made aliue and at the day of iudgement at his voice when the trump shall blowe all that are dead shall rise againe so it is in the first resurrectio they that are dead in their sinnes at his voice uttered in the ministerie of the worde shall rise againe to goe further christ raised three from the deade iairus daughter newly dead the widowes son dead and wound up and lying on the hearse lazarus dead and buried amp stinking in the graue and all this he did by his very voice so also by the preaching of his word he raiseth all sortes of sinners euen such as haue lien long in their sinnes as rotting and stinking carrion the sacraments also are the pipe and conduits wherby god conveigheth grace into the heart if they be rightly used that is if they be receiued in unfained repentance for all our sinnes and with a true and liuely faith in christ for the pardon of the same sinnes and so i take it they are compared to flagons of wine which reuiue the church being sicke and fallen into a sownd as for the measure of life derived from christ it is but small in this life and giuen by little and little as ose saieth the lorde hath spoiled vs and he will heale us hee hath wounded us and he will bind us up after two daies he will revive us and in the third he will raise us vp and we shall live in his sight the prophet ezechiel in a vision is caried into the middest of a field full of dead bones and hee is caused to prophesie ouer them and say o ye drie bones heare the vvorde of the lord and at the first there was a shaking and the bones came togither bone to bone and then sinewes and flesh grew upon them and upon the flesh grewe a skinne then he prophesied vnto the windes the second time and they liued and stood upon their feete for the breath came upon them and they were an exceeding great armie of man hereby is signified not only the state of the iewes after their captivitie but in them the state of the whole church of god for these temporall deliverances signified further a spirituall deliuerance and we may here see most plainely that god worketh in the heartes of his children the giftes and graces of regeneration by little and little first he giueth no more then flesh sinewes and skin then after he giueth them further graces of his spirite which quickeneth them and maketh them aliue unto god the same also wee may see in the vision of the water that ranne out of the temple first a man must wade to the ancles then after to the knees and so to the loines then after the water grovve to a river that can not be passed ouer and so the lord conueieth his graces by little and little till at the last man haue a full measure thereof thirdly the resurrection of christ serueth as an argument to proue unto us our resurrection at the day of iudgement paul saieth if the spirite of christ that raised up iesus from the deade dvvell in you hee that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortall body some will say that this is no benefite for all must rise againe as well the wicked as the godly ansvver true indeede but yet the wicked rise not againe by the same cause that the godly doe they rise againe by the power of christ not as hee is a saviour but as hee is a iudge to condemne them for god had saide to adam that at what time he should eate of the forbidden fruite he should die the death meaning a double death both the first and the second death nowe then the ungodly rise againe that god may inflict upon them the punishment of the second death which is the rewarde of sinne that so god iustice may be satisfied but the godly rise againe by the power of christ their heade and redeemer who raiseth them up that they may bee partakers of the benefite of his death which is to enioy both in bodie and soule the kingdome of heauen which he ha h so dearely bought for them thus much for the comfortes now follow the duties and they are also three first as christ iesus vvhen he was deade rose againe from death to life by his owne power so we by his grace in imitation of christ must endeauour our selues to rise up from all our sinnes both originall and actuall vnto newenesse of life this is worthily set downe by the apostle saying we are buried by baptisme into his death that as christ was raised vp from the dead by the glorie of the father so we also should walke in newnesse of life and therefore vve must endeauour our selues to shevve the same power to be in us euery day by rising up from ou owne personall sinnes to a reformed life this ought to be remembred of us because howsoeuer many heare amp know it yet very ewe doe practise the same for to speake plainly as dead man buried vvould neuer heare though a man shoulde speake neuet so loude so undoubtedly among us there be also many living man which are almost in the same case the ministers of god may cry unto them daily and iterate the same thing a thousand times and tell them that they must rise up from their sinnes and lead a new life but they heare no more then the deade carkasse that lieth in the graue indeede man heare with their outward eares but they are so farre from practising this dutie that they iudge it to be a matter of reproch and ignominie and those which make any coscience of this duty how they are laden with nicknames amp taunts who knoweth not i need not to rehearse the so odious a thing now a daies is the rising fro sinne to newnes of life sound a trumpet in a dead mans eares he stirres not and let us crie for amendment of life till breath goe out of our body no man almost saieth what haue i done and for this cause undoubtedly if it were not for conscience of that dutie which man owe unto god we should haue but fewe ministers in england for it is the ioy of a minister to see his people rise from sinne and to lead a new life whereas alas man generally lie snurting in their corruptions and rather goe forwarde in them still then come to any amendment such is the woonderfull hardnes amp untovvardnes that hath possessed the heartes of most man he which hath but halfe an eie may see this to be true oh how exceedes atheisme in all places contempt of god worshippe profanation of the sabbath the whordomes and fornications the crueltie and oppression of this age it cryes euen to heauen for vengeance by these amp such like sins the vvorld crucifies christ againe for look as pilates souldiours with the wicked iewes tooke christ and stripped him of his garments buffetted him and slue him so doe vngodly man by their wicked behauiour strip him of all honour and slay him againe if an infidell should come among vs and yeelde himselfe to be of our religion after hee had seene the behauiour of man hee would peraduenture leaue all religio for he might say surely it seemes this god whome these man worship is not the true god but a god of licentious libertie and that which is mo e whereas at all times we ought to shew our selues new creatures and to walke worthie of our sauiour and redeemer and therefore also ought to rise out of our sinnes and to liue in righteousnes and true holines yet we for the most part goe on still forward in sinne and euery day goe deeper then other to hel ward this hath beene heretofore the comon practise but let vs now learne after the example of christ being quickned and reuiued by his grace to endeauor our selues especially to come out of the graue of sinne and learne to make conscience of euery badde action true it is a christian man may vse the creatures of god for his delight in a moderate and godly manner but christ neuer gaue libertie to any to liue licentiously for he that is free is yet servant vnto christ as paul saith and therefore we must doe nothing but th t which may be a worke of some good dutie vnto god to which ende the apostle saith awake thou that sleepest and stand vp from the deade and christ shall giue thee life if this will not mooue vs yet let the iudgements of god draw vs hereunto blessed is he saith the holy ghost that hath part in the first resurrection for on such the second death hath no power where mention is made of a double death the first is the separation of soule amp bodie the second is the eternall condemnation of soule and bodie in hell fire would we now escape the second death after this life we must then labour in this life to be partakers of the first resurrection amp that on this manner looke what sinnes we haue liued in hertofore we must endeauour to come out of them all and leade a better life according to all the commandements of god but if ye will haue no care of your owne soules goe on hardly and so ye shall be sure to enter into the second death which is eternal damnation secondly we are taught by the example of saint paul to labour aboue all things to know christ and the vertue of his resurrection and this we shall doe when we can say by experience that our hearts are not content with a formall and drowsie profession of religion but that wee feele the same power of christ whereby he raised vp himselfe from death to life to be effectuall and powerfull in vs to worke in our hearts a conversion from all our sinnes wherein we haue lien deade to newnes of life with care to liue godly in christ iesus and that we may further attaine to all this we must come to heare the word of god preached and taught with feare and trembling hauing heard the word we must meditate therein and pray vnto god not onely publikely but priuately also intreating him that he would reach forth his hand and pull vs out of the graue of sinne wherein we haue lien dead so long and in so doing the lord of his mercie according as he hath promised will send his spirit of grace into our hearts to worke in vs an inward sense and feeling of the vertue of christs resurrection so dealt he with the two disciples that were going to emmaus they were occupied in the meditation of christ his death and passion and whiles they were in hearing of christ who conferred with them he gaue them such a measure of his spirite as made their hearts to burne within them and paul praieth for the ephesians that god would inlighten their eyes that they might see and feele in themselues the exceeding greatnes of the power of god which he wrought in christ iesus when he raised him from the dead thirdly as saint paul saith if we be risen with christ then we must seeke the things that are aboue but how and by what meanes can we rise with christ seeing we did not die with him ans we rise with christ thus the burgesse of a town in the parliament house beareth the person of the whole towne amp whatsoeuer he saith that the whole town saith amp whatsoeuer is done to him is also done to all the towne so christ vpon the crosse stood in our place amp bare our person amp what he suffred we suffred amp when he died all the faithfull died in him and so likewise as he is risen againe so are all the faithfull risen in him the consideration whereof doth teach vs that we must not haue our hearts wedded to this world vve may vse the things of this life but yet so as though we vsed them not for all our loue and care must be for things aboue and specially we must seeke the kingdom of god amp his righteousnes peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost vve must therefore sue for the pardon of sinne for reconciliation to god in christ amp for sanctification these are the pretious pearles which we must seeke and when we haue found them we must sell all that we haue to buie them amp hauing bought them we must lay them vp in the secret corners of our hearts valuing and esteeming of them as better then all things in the world beside thus much of christs resurrection containing the first degree of christs exaltation now followeth the second in these words he ascended into heauen in the handling wherof we are to consider these speciall points i the time of his ascention ii the place iii the manner iv the witnesses v the vses thereof for the first the time of christs ascension was fourtie daies after his resurrection when he had taught his disciples the things which appertain to the kingdome of god and this shews that he is a most faithfull amp carefull king ouer his church procuring the good thereof and therfore esay saith the gouernment is on his shoulder amp the apostle saith he was more faithfull in all the house of god then moses was hence we gather that whereas the apostles changed the sabbath from the seuenth day to the eight it was no doubt by the counsell amp direction of chist before his ascension amp likewise in that they planted churches and appointed teachers and meete ouerseers for the guiding and instruction hereof we may resolue our selues that christ prescribed the same vnto them before his ascesion amp for these amp such like causes did he ascend no sooner now look what care christ at his ascensio had ouer his church the same must al masters of families haue ouer their houshold when god shall call them out of this worlde they must haue care not onely that their families be well gouerned while they liue but also that after their death peace loue and good order may be continued in their posteritie and therefore the prophet esay is sent to ezechias king of iudah to bid him se his house in order for he must die signifying that it is the dutie of a good master of a familie not onely to haue care for the gouernment of his house whilst he is aliue but also that it may be well gouerned when he is deade the same also must be practised of god ministers their fidelitie must be seene in this that they haue not onely a care to feede their particular flockes while they are aliue but also they must further prouide for the people after their departure as much as they can example whereof we haue in peter who saith i will endeauour alwaies that ye may be able also to haue remembrance of these things after my departure the place of christs ascension was the mount of oliues neere bethanie and it was the same place from whece christ went to ierusalem to be crucified one place serue to be a passage both to paine and torments and also to glorie this shewes that the way to the kingdome of heauen is through afflictions in all ages there are many which haue god hand heauie vpon them in lingring sicknesses as the dead palsie and such like wherein they are faine to lie many yeares without hope of cure whereupon their beddes which should be vnto them places of rest and ease are but places of woe and miserie yet may these man hence haue great comfort if they can make good vse of their sicknesses for the beddes whereon they suffer so much torment shal be places from whence they shall passe to ioy and happines againe there be many that for the testimonie of the truth and for religions sake suffer imprisonment with many afflictions nowe if they can vse their afflictions well their prisons shalbe bethanies vnto them although they be places of bondage yet god wil at length make it a place of entrance to libertie many a man for the maintaining of faith and good conscience is banished out of his country and is faine to liue in a straunge place amog a people to whome he is vnknowne but let him vse it well for though it be a place of griefe for a time as bethanie was to christ when he went to suffer yet god will make it one day to be his passage into heauen thus much of the place of his ascending the third thing to be considered is the manner of christs ascension and it containeth three points the first that christ beeing now to ascend lifts vp his hands and blessed his disciples in the scripture are mentioned diverse kinds of blessings the first when one man praieth to god for a blessing vpon an other and this blessing doe kings and princes bestow vpon their subiects and parents on their children and for this cause children are taught to aske their fathers and mothers blessing that they may pray to god to blesse them there is another kind of blessing when a ma doth not only pray for a blessing but also pronounceth it this did the priests in the old testament and thus melchisedeck when he met abraham blessed him saying blessed article thou abraham of god the most high possessour of heauen and earth and this was the ordinarie dutie of the priests prescribed by god himselfe and therefore the very forme of wordes which they vsed is set downe after this manner the lord blesse thee and keepe thee the lord make his face to shine vpon thee ampc the third kinde of blessing is when a man doth not onely pray to god and pronounce blessing but by the spirit of prophecie doth foretell a particular blessing vpon any thus isaac blessed iaacob and esau particularly foretelling both their estates and iaacob blessed the twelue patriarks by the same spirit foretelling them what should befall them many hundred yeares after nowe our sauiour christ did not blesse his disciples any of these three waies and therefore there remaineth a fourth kinde of blessing which he vsed and that was after this manner christ in blessing his disciples did not onely pronounce or foretell a blessing that should come to his disciples but did conferre and giue the same vnto them for he is the fountaine and author of all blessings and therfore paul saith that god the father hath blessed vs in all spiritual blessings in christ hence we learne first that al those which denie themselues and flie to christ and put their affiance in him shalbe freeed from the curse of the lawe and from the wrath of god due vnto them for their sinnes whatsoeuer they are secodly that the curses of man must not discourage vs from doing well for though man curse yet christ blesseth and for this cause he saith woe be vnto you when all man speake well of you as if he should say then you want the blessing of god and we must remember that when man shall curse vs for doing our dutie euen then the blessing of god shall be vpon vs and the curse causelesse shall not hurt and god saith to abraham he wil curse them that curse him thirdly we learne that no witchcraft nor sorcerie which often are done with cursing shall be able to hurt vs for looke where christ will blesse there all the devil in hell can neuer fasten a curse this is found true by experience for when balaam the wizzard should haue cursed the people of israel and had assaied to doe it many waies but could not at length he said there is no sorcerie the english translation beeing otherwise here seemes to faile against iacob nor soothsaying against israel this is a notable comfort to the people of god that witches and sorcerers doe what they can shal neuer be able to hurt them it may be that their badde practises may annoy mens body and goods yet the lord wil turne all to a blessing vpon his servant either in this life or the life to come the second point is that christ went apart from his disciples and ascended vpward towarde heauen in their sight for the right vnderstanding of this sundrie speciall points must be obserued the first that the lifting vp of his bodie was principally by the mightie power of his godhead and partly by the supernaturall propertie of a glorified body which is to mooue as well vpward as downward without constraint or violence the second that christ did goe from earth to heauen really and actually and not in appearance onely the third that he went visibly in the sight of his disciples the fourth that he went locally by chaunging his place and going from earth to heauen so as he is no more on earth bodily as we are nowe on earth it may be obiected that christ made a promise that hee would be with his church to the ende of the worlde answer that promise is to be vnderstoode of the presence of his spirite or godheade not of the presence of his manhoode againe it may further be alleadged that if the godheade be on earth then must the manhoode be there also because they are both vnited together answer it is not true that of two things conioyned where the one is there must the other be also for the sun it selfe and the sun beames are both ioyned together yet they are not both in all places together for the bodie of the sun is onely in the heauens but the sun beames are also vpon the earth the argument therefore followes not christs manhoode subsibsts in that person which is euery where ergo his manhoode is euery where and the reason is because the son of god subsists not onely in his diuine nature but also by it wheras he doth not subsist at al by the manhood but onely in it for he subsisted before all eternitie when the manhoode was not nay rather because the manhoode doth subsist by the person of the son therefore the person extendes it selfe further then the manhoode which is assumed and sustained by it and hath his existing thence for that very thing whereby any other thing either essentially or accidentally is extends it selfe further then the thing whereby it is as the humane nature whereby peter is a man extendes it selfe further then to peter namely to all other man and the whitenesse whereby the snow is white extendes it selfe further then to that snowe which a man holds in his hande the third point is that in the ascension a cloud tooke christ from the sight of his disciples and whereas hee caused a cloud to come betweene their sight and himselfe it signified vnto them that they must novve be contented with that which they had seene and not seeke to know further what became of him afterward and the same thing is taught vnto vs also we must content our selues with that which god hath reuealed in his word and seeke no further specially in things which concerne god for the like ende in the giuing of the law in sinai god appeared in a cloud and when he did manifest his glorie in the temple which salomon made a thicke cloud filled the same the fourth point to be considered is concerning the witnesses of his ascension which were his owne disciples in the mount of oliues at bethanie and none but them now it may be demaunded why he would not haue all the whole nation of the iewes to see him ascend that so they might know that he was risen againe and beleeue in him answer the reason may be this t was his good pleasure that the points of faith and religion whereof this article is one should rather be learned by hearing then by seeing indeed christs owne disciples were taught the same by sight that they might the better teach others which should not see whereas nowe the ordinarie meanes to come by faith is hearing the vses to be made of christs ascension are of two sorts some are comforts to god church and people and some are duties the coforts are especially foure the first is this christ iesus did asced vp into heaue to lead captiuity captive a most worthy benefit by captiuitie is meant sinne and satan which did and doe lead man captiue into perdition death and the graue which held him captiue and in bondage for the space of three daies and he leads them all captiue two waies first in himselfe in that he began his triumph vpon the crosse as i haue shewed and continued the same till his very ascension secondly in all his members because by his mightie power being now ascended he doth subdue and weaken the power of sinne and satan which he manifesteth euery day by killing the corruption of their natures and the rebellion of their flesh but it may be demaunded how christ doth lead his enemy captiue considering the deuill raignes euery where and the world and death and hell answer christs victorie ouer his and our enemy hath fiue degrees first it is ordained by god secondly it is foretold thirdly it is wrought fourthly it is applied lastly it is accomplished the ordaining of it was before all worlds the foretelling of it was in all the ages of the old testament the working of it was vpon the crosse and afterward the applying hath bin since the beginning of the worlde more or lesse and it is onely in part in this life that while christ is in bruising of the heade of satan he againe may bruise his heele the accomplishment shall not be before the last iudgement from this great benefite bestowed on god church there are many dueties to be learned first here is an instruction for all ignorant persons and impenitent sinners which abound among vs in euery place whosoeuer they be that liue in the blindnes of their mindes and hardnes of their hearts they must knowe this that they are captiues and bondeslaues of sinne and satan of hell death and condemnation and let no man flat himselfe of what state or degree soeuer he be for it is god truth if he haue not repented of all his sinnes he as yet is no better then a captiue and vassall yes a very drudge of the deuill nowe then what wilt thou doe in this case the best thing is to lay to thy heart this benefite of christ he is ascended vp to heauen to leade captiue and to vanquish the deuill and all his angels vnder whome thou liest bound and that not onely in himselfe but in his members now then if thou wilt become a true member of christ he will free thee from this bondage therefore take heede how thou continuest longer in thy old sinnes and in thy grosse ignorance and seeing christ hath made a way to libertie let vs come out of this spirituall bondage he is ascended for this ende and purpose to free vs from it therefore if we refuse this benefite our state will be the more damnable any man that lies bound hand and foote in a darke dungeon and the keeper comes and sets open the prison dore and takes off his boults and biddes him come out if he refuse and say that he is well will not all man thinke that he is a madde man and will any be sorie for his case no surely well this is the state of all impenitent sinners they lie fast fettered and bound vnder the power of sinne amp satan and christ it is who is ascended into heauen to vnloose them of this bondage he hath set ope the prison dore and hath vnlocked our fetters if we refuse to come out and lie still in our sinnes there remaineth nothing for vs but euerlasting thraldome let vs therefore in the feare of god if wee haue a care of our owne soules receiue and embrace this benefite which redoundes vnto vs by christs ascension secondly in that christ is ascended to heauen to leade captiue sinne and satan here is a good consolation for all those that are afflicted in conscience for their sinnes there is no man in this case but he hath great cause to feare yet must he not be discouraged for christ by his ascension like a noble captaine hath taken sinne and satan prisoners and hath pinnioned them fast so as all the power that they haue is in christs hand and therefore though they doe exercise and afflict vs yet by his grace they shall neuer be able to preuaile against vs therfore we may safely cast our care vpon god and not feare ouermuch hence also we may learne a third dutie there is no man that knoweth what sinne meaneth and what the bloode of christ meaneth but in regard of the corruption of his owne nature he will say with paul that he is sold vnder sinne and in regard thereof will cry out with him also o wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death yes it will make his heart to bleede within him now what shall he doe in this case surely let him remember the ende of christs ascension which is to vanquish and subdue the rebellion of his nature and labour to feele the benefit thereof amp then he shall no doubt finde that christ will dissolue in him the workes of the deuill as saint john saith and treade satan vnder his feete and thus all those that feele in themselues the law of the members rebelling against the law of the minde must come to christ and he will helpe and free them the second benefit of christs ascension is that he ascended vp to heauen to bestow gifts vpon his church as it is said in the place before mentioned he ascended vp on high ampc he gaue gifts vnto man that is the gift of the knowledge of god word the gift of preaching and prophecie and all other gifts needefull for the good of his church the consideration of this that christ who is the fountaine of grace and in whome are hidde all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge should be mindefull of vs and vouchsafe such speciall fauour to his church must cause euery one of vs who haue receiued any gift of god as there is no man but he hath receiued his portion to be humbled in his owne eyes for the same there is no cause why we should be proude of our gifts seeing we haue nothing but that which we haue receiued for to this ende christ ascended to giue gifts vnto man and therefore our gifts whatsoeuer they be are not our owne but wee had them from christ and we are stewards of them a while for the good of others the more the lord giueth to a man the more he requireth at his handes and therefore those vvhich haue good gifts and doe abuse the same their sinne is the more grieuous and their daunger the greater man of great gifts vnlesse they vse them aright with humbled heartes shall want god blessing vpon theirs for he giueth grace to the humble the high hills after much tillage are often barren whereas the lowe valleis by the streames of vvaters passing through them are very fruitefull and the gifts of god ioyned vvith a swelling heart are fruitelesse but ioyned with loue and the grace of humilitie they edifie secondly if christ ascend vp to heauen to giue gifts vnto man here we may see how many a man and woman in these our daies are ouerseene in that they pleade ignorance and say that they hope god will haue them excused for it seeing they are not learned they haue dull wittes and it is not possible to teach them nowe they are past learning amp hereupon they presume they may liue in grosse ignorance as blinde almost in religion as when they were first borne but marke i pray you who it is that is ascended vp to heauen namely christ iesus our lord who made thee of nothing now was he able to giue thee a beeing when thou was not and is he not likewise able to put knowledge into thy soule if so be thou wilt vse the meanes which he hath appointed and the rather seeing he is ascended for that ende but if thou wilt not vse the meanes to come to knowledge thy case is desperate and thou article the cause of thine owne condemnation and thou bringest confusion vpon thine owne heade therefore let ignorant man labour for knowledge of god worde ignorance shall excuse none it will not stand for payment at the day of iudgement christ is ascended to this ende to teach the ignorant to giue knowledge and wisedome vnto the simple and to giue gifts of prophecie vnto his ministers that they may teach his people therfore i say againe let such as be ignorant vse the meanes diligently and god will giue the blessing thirdly whereas it is thought to be a thing not possible to furnish a whole church with preaching ministers it seemes to be otherwise for wherefore did christ ascend to heauen was it not to giue gifts vnto his church what is christs hand now shortned vndoubtedly we may resolue our selues that christ bestowed gifts sufficient vpon man in the church but it is for our sinnes that they are not imploied the fountaines of learning the vniversities though they are not dammed vp yet they streame not abroad as they might many there be in them indewed with worthie gifts for the building of the church but the couetousnes of man hinders the cofortable entrance which otherwise might be lastly seeing christ ascended to giue gifts needefull for his church as the gift of teaching the gift of prophecie the gift of tongues of wisedome and knowledge the duetie of euery man is especially of those which liue in the schooles of learning to labour by all meanes to increase cherish and preserue their gifts and as paul exhorteth timothie to stirre vp the gift of god as man preserue the fire by blowing it so by our diligence we must kindle and reuiue the gifts of god bestowed on vs christ hath done his part and there is nothing required but our paines and fidelitie the third benefite that comes by christs ascension is that he ascended to prepare a place for all that should beleeue in him in my fathers house saith christ are many dwelling places if it were not so i would haue told you j goe to prepare a place for you for by the sinne of adam our entrance into heauen was taken away if adam by his fall did exclude himselfe from the earthly paradise then how much more did hee exclude himselfe from heauen and therefore all mankinde sinning in him was likewise depriued of heauen the people of israel beeing in woe and miserie cried out that they had sinned and therefore the lord had couered himselfe with a cloud that their praiers could not passe through and esay saith that our sinnes are a wall between god and vs that we cannot enter into heauen and saint john that no vncleane thing must enter into the heauenly hierusalem nowe seeing we haue shut our selues out of heauen by our sinnes it was requisite that christ iesus our sauiour should goe before vs to prepare a place and to make readie a way for vs for he is king ouerall he hath the keies of heauen he openeth and no man shutteth and therefore it is in his power to let vs in though we haue shut our selues out but some may say if this be the end of his ascension to prepare a place in heauen then belike such as died before the comming of christ were not in heauen answer as there are two degrees of glorie one incomplete and the other complete or perfect for the faithfull departed are in glorie but in part and there remaineth fulnes of glorie for them at the day of iudgement when soule and bodie shall be both glorified together so answearably there are two degrees of preparation of places in heauen the places of glorie were in part prepared for the faithful fro the beginning of the world but the full preparation is made by christs ascension and of this last preparation is the place of john to be vnderstood the vse of this doctrine is very profitable first it ouerthroweth the fond doctrine of the church of rome which teacheth that christ by his death did merit our iustification and that we beeing once iustified doe further merit saluation and purchase for our selues a place in heauen but this is as it were to make a partition betweene christ and vs in the worke of our redemption whereas in truth not onely the beginning and continuance of our saluation but also the accomplishment thereof in our vocation iustification sanctification glorification is wholly and onely to be ascribed to the meere merit of christ and therefore hauing redeemed vs on earth he also ascends to prepare a place in heauen for vs secondly this serueth to condemne the fearefull lamentable and desperate securitie of these our daies great is the loue of christ in that he was content to suffer the pangs of hell to bring vs out of hell and withall to goe to heauen to prepare a place for vs there and yet who is it that careth for this place or maketh any account thereof who forsaketh this world and seekes vnto christ for it nowe least any man should say alas i knowe not the way therefore christ before he ascended made a new and liuing way with his owne blood as the apostle speaketh and to take away all excuses from man he hath set markes and bounds in this way and hath placed guides in it namely his ministers to shew all the passengers a straight amp readie course into the kingdom of heauen and though christ haue done all this for vs yet the blindnes and securitie of man is such that none almost walketh in this way nor careth to come to this mansion place but in stead of this they walke in by waies according to the lusts of their owne flesh when they are commaunded to goe eastward to ierusalem they turne westward an other way when they are commanded to goe on forward to heauen they turne againe backward and goe straight to hell man runne on all the daies of their liues in the broad way that leadeth to destruction and neuer so much as once make inquirie for a resting place in heauen but when the houre of death commeth then they call for the guide whereas all their liues before they haue run out of the way many thousand miles but then alas it is too late vnlesse it be the vnspeakeable mercie of god for they haue wandred so farre astray that in so short a space they cannot be able to come into the right way againe yet generally this is the state of most among vs whose securitie is so much the more grieuous amp fearefull because christ hath done al that heart can wish there is nothing else required but onely that by his grace we should walk in the way there was neuer any that knew the state of the people in these daies but he will say that this is most true which i say besides as by this we are brought to a sight of the desperate securitie of this age so we may further learne our owne dueties is christ gone to heauen beforehand to prepare a place for thee the practise that which paul teacheth haue thy conuersation in heauen the wordes which he vseth are very significant and the meaning of them is this ye are free denizens of the citie of god and therefore as freemen in god house let all your cares and studies all your affaires and doings be in heauen in the world if a man make purchase of an house his heart is alwaies there there he pulls downe and builds againe there he makes him orchards and gardens there hee meanes to liue and die christ iesus hath bought the kingdome of heauen for vs the most blessed purchase that euer was amp hath paid the dearest price for it that euer was paid euen his owne pretious blood and in this citie he hath prepared for vs a dwelling place and made vs free denizens of it therefore all our ioy and all our affaires ought to be there but how shall a man vpon earth haue his conuersation in heauen answer we must converse in heauen not in bodie but in heart amp therfore though our body be on earth yet our hearts ioy and comfort and all our meditation must be in heauen thus must we behaue our selues like good freemen in god house it must be farre from vs to haue our ioy and our hearts set on the things of this world thirdly the consideration of this that christ iesus hath prepared a place for vs in heauen amp also hath trayned the way with his own blood must make euery one of vs to striue to enter in at the straight gate as our sauiour christ counselleth vs and that as wrastlers doe which striue for life and death within this gate is a dwelling place of happines readie for vs if a man were assured that there were made for him a great purchase in spaine or turkey so as if hee would but come thither he might inioy it would he not adventure the daungers of the sea and of his enemy also if neede were that he might come to his owne wel behold christ iesus hath made a purchase for vs in heauen amp there is nothing required of vs but that we will come and enioy it why then should man refuse any paines or feare in the way nay we must striue to get in it may be we shalbe pinched in the entrance for the gate is both straight and low and we must be faine to leaue our wealth behinde vs amp the pleasures of this life and enter we must though we should be constrained to leaue our flesh behinde vs for the purchase that is made is worth tenne thousand worlds and besides if we loose it by fainting in the way our purchase shalbe the blacknes of darknes for euer with the deuill and all his angels who therfore would not striue though he lost his life in the gate the vrging of this point is needefull in these daies there is striuing ynough for worldly preferment but a man almost may goe alone in the straight way that leadeth to heauen he shall haue none to beare him company and where are they that striue to enter in where is the violence offered to the kingdome of heauen where be the violent which should take it to themselues as in the daies of john baptist fourthly if christ haue prepared a place for vs in heauen then we are in this world as pilgrimes and straungers and therefore must learne the counsell of saint peter as stragers amp pilgrimes abstain fro fleshly lusts which fight against the soule he that doth esteem him self as a pilgrime is not to intangle himselfe with the affaires of this world nor put in practise the behauiour thereof but to behaue himselfe as a freeman of heauen as straungers vse to liue in foreign country according to the fashion of their owne and therefore in thought word and deede in life amp conuersatio he must so carrie himselfe as thereby he may appeare to all the world of what cuntry he is an ancient divine speaking of such as had curled and embrodered haire biddeth them consider whether they must goe to heauen with such haire or no and wheras they adorned themselues with winkles made of other womens haire he asks them whether it may not be the haire of a damned person or no if it may be he further demaundeth how it may beseeme them to weare it which professe themselues to be the sonnes and daughters of god the like may be saide of all other sinnes they that be of god house must behaue themselues as free man there and when god hath made us free it doth not beseeme us to make our selues bondmen of sin amp satan and of this world fiftly seeing christ went to heauen to prepare a place for all that beleeue in him here is a good duetie for parentes many of them are verie carefull to preferre their children to great places and noble mens houses and they are not to be blamed therefore but if they would indeede be good parents to their children they should first endeauour them selues to get roomes for them in heauen they that doe this are good parents indeede some will say how shall wee get this preferrement for them ansvver god hath two houses his church and the kingdome of heauen the church is his house of grace heauen is his house of glorie now if thou wouldst haue thy child to haue a place in the house of glorie then thou article first of all to get him a place in the house of grace bringing him up so in the feare of god that both in life and conuersation he may shewe himselfe to be a member of the church and then assure thy selfe that after this life he shall be remooued to the second house of god which is the house of glorie and there be free man for euer in the kingdome of heauen add if thou shalt thus prouide for thy childe thou shalt not leaue him as an orphan but he shall haue god for his father amp christ for his brother and the holy ghost his comforter and therefore first of all and aboue all remember to make thy childe a member of god church let the example of dauid excite all parents hereunto i had rather saieth hee be a dore keeper in the house of god then to dwell in the tabernacles of wickednesse for a day in thy courtes is better then a thousand else where lastly hence we may finde remedie against the tediousnesse of sickenesse and the feare of death thou which fearest death remember that christ is gone to heauen to prepare a place for thy bodie where it must be glorified and liue for euer with the blessed trinitie and all the saintes and angels though for a while it lie dead and rotte in the graue remember this also thou which continuest in any lingring sicknes christ iesus hath prepared a place for thee wherin thou shalt rest in ioy amp blisse without all paine or faintnes the fourth benefi e is that christ ascended vp to heaue to send the comforter vnto his church this was a speciall end of his ascension as appeares by christs own words it is saith he expedient that i go away for if i goe not the comforter will not come but if i depart i will send him unto you and againe i will pray unto the father amp hee shall give you another comforter which shall abide with you for euer even the spirite of truth but some will say how can christ send his spirit unto his church for the person sending amp the person sent are unequall whereas all three persons in trinitie are equall none greater or less then another none inferiour or superiour to other ans it is true indeed but we must know that the action of sending in the trinitie makes not the persons unequall but only shewes distinction and order among equals the father sendes the son the father and the son both send the holy ghost yet the father is not aboue the son neither the father or the son aboue the holy ghost but all are equall in degree though in regarde of order one is before another and it standeth with reason for two man that are equall in degree may upon mutuall consent one send another but it may be further demanded how the holy ghost can be sent which is euery where ans the holy ghost indeed is euery where therfore he is sent not so much in regard of the presence of his essence or substance as of his operation whereby he renueth amp guideth the members of christ now here first we haue occasion to consider the miserie of the world when a man is troubled in his minde as no ungodly man but sometime he feeleth the terrour of conscience for his sinnes then he labours to remoue it by mery company amp pleasant bookes whereas christ at his ascension sent his holy spirite to be the comforter of his church amp therefore when we are troubled in conscience for our sins we should not seek ease by such slender means but rather seeke for the helpe amp comfort of the holy ghost and labour to haue our sinnes washed away and our hartes purified and clensed by the bl od of christ as for wine and mirth amp such like meanes of comfort neither at the day of death nor at the day of iudgement shall they stande us in stead or be able to comfort us again when crosses amp calamities fall the counsell of the minister is not sought for but the help of such as are called cunning man amp cunning woman is that is of charmers inchanters amp figure casters a bad practise christ at his ascensio set his holy spirit vnto his church amp people to be their guide amp comforter in their calamities and miseries and therefore when any man is in distresse he should haue recourse to the right meanes of comfort namely the word amp sacraments amp there he shall finde the assistance of the holy ghost thus the prophet isai informeth the iewes when they shall say unto you inquire at them which haue a spirit of divination amp at the soothsayers which whisper and murmure should not a people inquire at their god from the living to the dead to the law and to the testimony rebecca when the two twinnes stroue in her womb what did she the text saith she sent to aske the lorde yet commonly the man of these daies leaue god amp seeke to the instruments of the deuill to goe yet further god useth for sundrie causes most of all to afflict his deerest children iudgement saieth peter beginnes at god house s luke saieth that a certaine woman was bound of satan eighteene yeeres but what was shee a daughter of abraham that is a child of god when the like condition shall befall any of vs let us remember the end why christ ascended up to heauen and pray unto god that hee will giue us his spirit that therby we may be eased amp deliuered or els inabled to perseuere and continue in patience and this is the true way and meanes to lighten and ease the burden of all afflictions and for this cause paul prayeth that the colossians might be strengthened with all might through his glorious power unto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnesse for to whomsoeuer god giueth grace to beleeue to them also he giues power to suffer affliction by the inward worke of his spirite secondly if christ haue sent unto his church the holy spirite to be our comforter our duty is to prepare our body and soules to be fitte temples and houses for so worthy a guest if a man were certified that a prince would come to his house he would dresse it up amp haue all things in as good order as might be and shall not we much more endeauour to purifie and clense our soules and body from all sinne that they may be fitte temples for the entertainment of the holy ghost whom christ iesus hath sent to be our comforter the shunamite was carefull to entertaine the man of god elisha for shee saide to her husbande let vs make him a litle chamber i pray thee with vvalles and let vs set him there a bed and a stoole a table and a candlesticke now how much more carefull ought we be to entertaine god himselfe who is content to come and dwell with us and therefore we must adorne our body and soules with grace that he may lodge and suppe and dine with us as he hath promised but on the contrarie if we defile our body with sinne wee banish the holy ghost out of our hearts and suffer the diuell to dwell in us for the more a man defileth his bodie the fitter and cleaner it is for him and to conclude this point let us remember that saying which is used of some that christ when hee went hence gaue us his pawne namely his spirit to assure us that hee woulde come to us againe and also hee tooke with him our pawne namely his flesh to assure us further that wee should ascend up to him thus much for the benefites of christes ascension now follow the duties whereunto we are mooued and they are two first we must be here admonished to renounce the ubiquitie and the errour of the reall and essentiall presence of the bodie of christ in the sacrament of the lordes supper as flatly oppugning this article of christs ascension into heauen for it is flat against the nature of a true body to subsist in many places at once secondly as the apostles then did whe they saw christ ascending up into heauen so must we do also while he was present with them they gaue him honour but when they saw him ascending they adored him with farre greater reuerence and so must we now for the same cause bow the knees of our hearts unto him thus much of the second degree of the exaltation of christ now follow the third in these wordes and sitteth at the right hand of god the father almightie in the handling whereof we are first to shewe the meaning of the wordes secondly the comforts and benefits that redound to god church thirdly the duties that we are mooued unto for the meaning of the wordes if we speake properly god hath neither right hand nor left neither can he be saide to sit or stand for god is not a bodie but a spirite the words therefore containe a borrowed speech from earthly kings amp potentates whose manner and custome hath beene to place such persons at their right hands whome they purposed to advance to any speciall office or dignitie so king salomon when his mother came to speake with him rose up from his throne and mette her and caused a seate to be set at his owne right hand and set her upon it in token no doubt of honour which he gaue unto her to the same purpose dauid saith vpon thy right hand did stand the queene in a vesture of golde and the sonnes of zebedeus made sute to christ that one of them might sit at his right hand and the other at his left in his kingdome now their request was to haue the two speciall and principall dignities of his kingdome thus we see it is manifest that the sitting at the right hand of an earthly prince signifieth advancement into authority and honour and therefore the same phrase of speech applied to christ signifieth two things first his full and manifest exaltation in dignitie honour and glorie and in this sense it is saide that to him is given a name that is above all names that at the name of iesus every knee should bovve secondly it signifieth his full and manifest exaltation into the authoritie and gouernment of his kingdome which spreadeth it selfe ouer heauen and earth so dauid saieth the lorde saide vnto my lorde sit thou at my right hand untill i make thine enimies thy footstoole which place beeing alledged by saint paul repeating the wordes but changing the phrase is thus set downe he shall raigne till he have put all his enemy under his feete and to speake in breefe the scope of the wordes is to shewe that christ god and man after his ascension is advanced to such an estate in which hee hath fulnesse of glorie power maiestie and authoritie in the presence of his father and all the saintes and holy angels furthermore in the words three circumstances must be obserued the first is the place where christ is thus aduaced noted in the former article he ascended into heaven amp sittes namely in heauen at the right hand of god the place then where christ iesus in both his natures as he is god and also man doth rule in full glory power and maiestie is heauen it selfe to which effect paul saith god raised christ from the dead and put him at his right hand in the heavenly places and in the epistle to the hebrewes it is said he sitteth at the right hand of the maiestie in highest places this point well considered serueth to discouer the ouersight of sundrie divines which hold and teach that to sit at the right hand of god is to be euery where in all places and not in heauen onely that they might hereby lay a foundation for the ubiquitie of christs manhood which neuerthelesse the heauens must containe till the time that all thinges be restored the second circumstance is the time when christ began to sit at the right hand of god the father which is to be gathered by the order of the articles for first christ died and was buried then he rose againe and ascended into heauen and after his ascension he is saide to sit at the right hand of his father this order is also noted unto us by s paul who shall condemne saith he it is christ which is dead yes or rather which is risen againe who is also at the right hand of god and s marke saith when christ vvas risen againe hee appeared to his disciples and after he had spoken unto them he was received into heaven and sate at the right hande of god but it may be demanded how this can stand with trueth that christ should not begin to sit at the right hand of his father before the ascension considering he is one god with the father and therefore an absolute and soueraigne king from all eternitie ansvver as christ is god or the word of the father hee is coequall and coeternall with him in the regiment of his kingdome and hath neither beginning middle or ending thereof yet as christ is god incarnate and in one person god man or man god he beganne after his ascension and not before to sit at the right hand of his father and as s peter saith was made lord partly because as hee was god hee did then manifest himselfe to be that which indeed he was before namely god and lorde of heauen and earth and partly because as he was man he receiued dominion or lordship fro the father which he had not before amp thereby was euen in his manhood exalted to be king of heauen and earth amp in this sense christ saith of himselfe all power is given to me in heaven and earth the third circumstance is concerning the person at whose right hand christ sits noted in the words of the article of god the father almightie wherby is signified that he receiues all the honour power amp glory of his kingdom fro his father as he that is set at the right hand of a prince receiues the honour amp authority which he hath fro the prince now if it be alledged that by this means christ shalbe inferiour to his father because he which receiueth honor of another is inferiour to him of whome he receiueth it the answer is that in christ we must consider his person amp his office in respect of his person as he is the eternall son of god he is equal to the father amp is not here said to sit at his right had yet in respect of the office vvhich he beares namely as he is mediatour amp as he is man he is inferiour to the father amp receiues his kingdom fro him as he is god he is our king amp head amp hath no head more then the father as he is mediatour he is also our head yet so as he is under the father as being his head and we must not think it strage that one amp the same thing should be both equall and inferiour to another diverse respects considered now in that christes placing at the right hand of his father argues inferioritie betweene the father and him hence wee learne that they are deceiued which from this article gather that in the glorification of christ there is a transfusion of the proprieties of the godhead as omnipotencie omniscience omnipresence ampc into his manhoode for this is to abolish all inferioritie and to make an equality betweene the creature and the creatour and whereas againe the word almightie is repeated it is done upon speciall reason because christes sitting at the right hand of god doth presuppose omnipotencie for in vaine were all power in heauen and earth giuen to him vnlesse he were omnipotent as the father to execute the same and therefore the song of the elders was on this maner worthy is the lambe that was killed to receive power and riches and wisdome amp strength and honour and glory and praise the benefites which redounde unto us by christes sitting at the right hand of god are two one concernes his priesthood the other his kingly office the benefit rising from his priesthood is his intercession for us for this is one of the endes why christ is now exalted in glorie amp sittes at the right hand of his father namely to make request in the behalfe of all that come unto him as paul saieth christ is risen againe and sitteth at the right hand of god and maketh request for vs now that we may rightly vnderstand what his intercession is we are to consider these pointes first to whome it is made secondly in what maner thirdly whether it be made by christ alone or no fourthly what be the fruites and benefites thereof fiftly the duties whereunto wee are mooued thereby for the first intertercession is to make suite request or intreatie in some ones behalfe to another and this is done by christ for vs unto god as paul saith there is one god amp one mediatour betwene god and man which is the man christ iesus here at the verie first ariseth a difficultie for in euery intercession there be three parties the person offended the person offending the intercessour distinct from them both now if christ the son of god make intercession to god for man then he makes intercession to himselfe because hee is true god which ca not be how then shall christ be mediatour ans this point hath so troubled the church of rome that for the resoluing of it they haue deuised an errour avouching that christ is mediatour onely as hee is man not as hee is god which is untrue for as both natures did concurre in the worke of satisfaction so likewise they doe both concurre in the worke of intercession and therefore a more meete amp convenient answer is this christ iesus god man in both natures is directly our mediatour to the first person the father as s john saith if any man sinne we haue an advocate with the father iesus christ the iust and thus we haue three persons in the worke of intercession really distinguished the partie offended is god the father the partie offending is man and thirdly the intercessour distinct from them both is christ the second person in trinitie for howsoeuer in godhead he and the father be one yet in person they are really distinguished amp he is as it were in the middle betweene the father amp us for the father is god amp not ma we that beleeue in christ are man not god christ himselfe both man amp god it may be further replied that this answer will not stand because not only the father is offended but also the son amp the h ghost amp therefore there must be a mediatour to them also ans the intercessio of christ is directed to the father the first person immediatly now the father the son and the h ghost haue all one in diuisible essence amp by consequent one and the same will wherupo the father being appeased by christs intercessio the son amp the holy ghost are also appeased in him thus then intercession is made to the whole trinitie but yet immediatly amp directly to the first person and in him to the rest the second point to be considered is the manner of his intercession vnto his father wee must not imagine that christ now in heauen kneeles downe on his knees amp vtters words and puts up a supplication for all the faithfull to god the father for that is not beseeming the maiesty of him that sits at the right hand of god but the maner of his intercessio is thus to be conceiued when one is to speake to an earthly prince in the behalf of another first of all he must come into the presence of the king and secondly make his request and both these christ perfourmeth for us unto god for the first after his ascension he entred into heaue where he did present vnto his father first of all his owne person in two natures and secondly the invaluable merits of his death and passion in which he is well pleased and we must further understand that as on the crosse hee stoode in our roome so in heauen he now appeares as a publicke person in our stead representing all the elect that shall beleeue in him as the holy ghost saith christ iesus ascended up into heaven to appeare in the sight of god for us and for the second christ makes request for us in that he willeth according to both his natures and desireth as he is man that the father woulde accept his satisfaction in the behalfe of all that are giuen unto him and that he makes request on this maner i prooue it thus looke what was his request in our behalfe when he was here upon earth the same for substance it cotinues still in heauen but here on earth the substance of his requests was that he willed and desired that his father would be well pleased with us for his merites as appeares by his praier in s john father i will that those which thou hast given me be with me even where i am that they may beholde my glorie which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the worlde therefore hee still continues to make request for us by willing and desiring that his father woulde accept his merites in our behalfe if it be alledged that christ in this solemne praier vsed speech and prostration of his bodie the answere is that these actions were no essentiall partes of his praier the prostrating of his bodie serued onely as a token of his submission to god as hee was a creature and the speech which he used serued onely to utter and expresse his request furthermore a difference here must be marked betweene christs passion and his intercession the passion serues for the working and causing of a satisfaction to god iustice for us and it is as it were the tempering of the plaister the intercession goes further for it applies the satisfaction made amp layes the salue to the verie sore and therefore christ makes request not onely for the elect generally but for particular man as paul iames john and that particularly as he testifieth of himselfe saying i have prayed for thee peter that thy faith faile not if any shall say that christs vvilling and desiring of a thing can not be a request or intercession the answere is that in vertue and efficacie it countervailes all the praiers in the world for whatsoeuer christ willeth the same also the father being well pleased with him willeth and therefore whatsoeuer christ as mediatour willeth for us at the handes of his father in effect or substance is a request or praier the third point is that christ alone and none with him makes intercession for us and this i prooue by induction of particulars first of all this office appertaines not to the angels they are indeed ministring spirits for the good of god chosen they reioice when a sinner is conuerted amp when he dieth they are ready to cary his soule into abrahams bosome amp god otherwhiles useth them as messengers to reveale his will thus the angell gabriel brings a message to zachary the priest that god had heard his prayer but it is not once said in all the scriptures that they make intercession to god for us as for the saints departed they can not make intercession for us because they know not our particular estates here on earth neither ca they heare our requests and therefore if we should pray to them to pray for vs wee should substitute them into the roome of god because we ascribe that to them which is proper to him namely the searching of the heart amp the knowledge of all things done upon earth though withall we should say that they do this not by themselues but of god as for the faithfull heare on earth indeede they haue warrant yes commaundement to pray one for another yet ca they not make intercessio for us for first he that makes intercessio must bring somthing of his own that may be of value amp price with god to procure the grant of his request secodly he must do it in his own name but the faithfull on earth make request to god one for another not in their owne names nor for their own merits but in the name and for the merits of christ it is a prerogatiue belonging to christ alone to make a request in his owne name and for his owne merits we therefore conclude that the worke of intercession is the sole worke of christ god amp man not belonging to any creature beside in heauen or in earth and whereas the papists can not content themselves with his intercession alone as being most sufficient it argues plainly that they doubt either of his power or of his will whereupon their praiers turne to sinne the fruites and benefites of christes intercession are these first by meanes of it we are assured that those which are repentant sinners shall stand and appeare righteous before god for euer at what time soeuer christ being now in heauen and there presenting himselfe and his merits before his father shewes himselfe desirous and willing that they whosoeuer they are beeing sinners should be accepted of god for the same euen then immediatly at that very instant this his will is done and they are accepted as righteous before god indeed when a man lookes vpon things directly through the aire they appeare in their proper formes and colours as they are but if they be looked upon through a greene glasse they all appeare greene so likewise if god behold us as wee are in our selues we appeare as vile and damnable sinners but if hee looke upon us as we are presented before his throne in heauen in the person of our mediatour christ iesus willing that wee should be approoued for his merits then we appeare without all spot amp wrinkle before him and this is the use paul makes hereof it is god saith he that iustifieth amp the reason is rendred for it is christ that is deade yes or rather which is risen againe who is also at the right hand of god and makes request for vs secondly christes intercession serues to preserue all repentant sinners in the estate of grace that beeing once iustified and sanctified they may so continue to the ende for when any servant of god is ouertaken by the corruption of his owne nature and falls into any particular sinne then christs intercession is made as a blessed hande to apply the salue of his death to that particular sore for he continually appeares before god and shewes himselfe to bee willing that god the father should accept his one only sacrifice for the daily and particular sinnes of this or that particular man and this is done that a man being iustified before god may not fall away quite from grace but for euery particular sinne may bee humbled and receiue pardon if this were not so our estate should be most miserable considering that for euery sin committed by us after our repentance we deserue to be cast out of the fauour of god thirdly christes intercession serueth to make our good workes acceptable to god for euen in the best works that a man can doe there are two wants first they are good onely in part secondly they are mingled with sinne for as a man is partly grace and partly flesh so are his vvorkes partly gratious and partly fleshly and because grace is only begun in this life therefore all the workes of grace in this life are sinnefull and imperfit now by christes intercession his satisfaction is applied to our persons amp by consequent the defect of our works is couered and remooued amp they are approoued of god the father in a vision s john saw an angell standing before the altar with a golden censure full of sweete odours to offer up with the praiers of the saintes upon the same and this signifies that christ presentes our workes before the throne of god and by his intercession sanctifies them that they may be acceptable to god and therefore we must remember that when we doe any thing that is accepted of god it is not for our sakes but by reason of the value and vigour of christ his merit fourthly the intercession of christ made in heauen breedeth and causeth in the heartes of man upon earth that beleeue another intercession of the spirit as paul saith he giveth vs his spirit which helpeth our infirmities amp maketh request for us with sighes which can not be expressed but he which searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the meaning of the spirit for he maketh request for the saints according to the will of god now the spirit is said to make request in that it stirres and mooues euery contrite heart to pray with sighes and grones unspeakable to god for things needfull amp this grace is a fruite deriued from the intercession of christ in heaven by the operation of the spirit for as the sun though the bodie of it abide in the heauens yet the beames of it descende to us that are on earth so the intercession of christ made in heauen is tyed as it were to his person alone yet the grones amp desires of the touched heart as the beames thereof are here on earth among the faithfull and therfore if we desire to know whether christ make intercession for us or no we need not to ascend up into the heauens to learne the truth but we must descend into our owne hearts amp looke whether christ haue giuen vs his spirite which makes us crie unto god amp make request to him with grones and sighes that can not be expressed and if we find this in our hearts it is an euident and infallible signe that christ continually makes intercession for us in heauen he that would know whether the sun shine in the firmament must not clime up into the cloudes to looke but search for the beames thereof upon the earth which when he sees he may conclude that the sun shines in the firmament and if wee would know whether christ in heauen makes intercession for us let us ransack our owne consciences and there make search whether we feele the spirit of christ crying in us abba father as for those that neuer feele this worke of god spirit in them their case is miserable whatsoeuer they be for christ as yet makes no intercession for them considering these two alwaies go togither his intercession in heauen amp the worke of his spirit in the hearts of man moouing them to bewaile their owne sinnes with sighes and grones that can not be expressed and to cry and pray unto god for grace amp therfore all such whether they be yong or old that neuer could pray but muble up a few words for fashion sake can not assure themselues to haue any parte in christs intercessio in heaue the duties to be learned hence are these first whereas christ maketh intercession for us it teacheth all man to be most carefull to loue and like this blessed mediatour and to be ready amp willing to become his servant amp disciples amp that not for forme amp fashion sake only but in all trueth and sincerity of heart for he is asceded to heauen amp there sits at the right hand of his father to make request for us that we might be deliuered fro hell amp come to eternall life wicked haman procured letters fro the king ahashuerosh for the destructio of all the iewes man woman amp childre in his dominions this done hester the queene makes request to the king that her people might be saued and the letters of haman reuoked shee obtaines her request amp freedom was giuen amp contrary letters of ioyfull deliuerance were sent in post hast to al province where the iewes were whereupo arose a wonderfull ioy amp gladnes among the iewes amp it is said that therupon many of the people of the land became iewes well now behold there is a greater matter among us then this for there is the handwriting of condenation the law amp therin the sentece of a double death of body amp soule amp satan as wicked haman accuseth us amp seekes by all meanes our condenatio but yet behold not any earthly hester but christ iesus the son of god is come downe fro heauen amp hath taken away this handwriting of condemnation amp cacelled it upon the crosse amp is now ascended into heauen amp their sits at the right hand of his father amp makes request for us amp in him his father is well pleased amp yeeldes to his request in our behalfe now then what must we doe in this case surely looke as the persians became iewes whe they heard of their safety so we in life and conversation must become christians turne to christ embrace his doctrine and practise the same unfainedly and we must not content our selues with a formall profession of religion but search into our own harts amp flie unto christ for the pardo of our sins amp that earnestly as for life amp death as the thief doth at the bar whe the iudge is giuing sentece against him whe we shall thus huble our selues the christ iesus that sits at the right had of god wil plead our cause amp be our atturny unto his father amp his father againe wil accept of his request in our behalfe the shall we of persians become iewes amp of the childre of this world become the sones of god secodly when we pray to god we must not doe as the blind world doth as it were rush upo god in praying to him without cosideratio had to the mediatour betweene us and him but we alwaies must direct our praiers to god in the name of christ for hee is aduanced to power and glory in heauen that he might be a fitte patrone for us who might preferre and present our praiers to god the father that thereby they might be accepted and we might obtaine our request so likewise wee must giue thankes to god in the name of christ for in him and for his sake god doth bestowe on us his blessings thus much of christes intercession the other benefite which concernes christs kingly office is that he sitts at the right hand of his father for the administration of that speciall kingdome which is committed to him i say speciall because he is our king not onely by the right of creation gouerning all things created togither with the father and the holy ghost but also more specially by the right of redemption in respect of another kingdome not of this world but eternall and spiritual respecting the very conscience of man in the administration wherof he hath absolute power to command amp forbid to condemne amp absolue and therefore hath the keies of heauen amp hell to open amp shutt which power no creature beside no not the angels in heaue can haue for the better understanding of this which i say wee are to consider first the dealing of christ toward his own church secondly his dealing in respect of his enimies and his dealing toward his own church stands in things the first is the collecting or gathering of it amp this is a speciall end of his sitting at the right hand of his father christ said to his disciples i haue chosen you out of this world amp the same may truly be saide of all the elect that christ in his good time will gather them all to himselfe that they may be a peculiar people to god and this action of his in collecting the church is nothing els but a translation of those whom he hath ordained to life euerlasting out of the kingdome of darknes in which they haue serued sinne amp satan into his owne kingdome of grace that they may be ruled and guided by him eternally and this hee doth two waies first by the preaching of the word for it is a powerfull outwarde meanes whereby hee singleth and sorteth his owne servant from the blinde and wicked vvorlde as paul saith he gaue some to be apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the gathering together of saints and hence we learne two things the first that euery minister of god word and euery one that intendeth to take vpon him that calling must propound vnto himselfe principally this end to single out man from man and gather out of this world such as belong to the church of christ and as ieremie saith to separate the pretious from the vile the second that all those which will be good hearers of god worde must shew themselues so farre forth conformable vnto it that it may gather them out of the world and that it may worke a chaunge in them and make them the servant of christ and if the preaching of the worde doe not worke this good worke in our hearts then the end will be a separation from the presence of god christ when he came neere ierusalem and considered their rebellion whereby they refused to be gathered vnto him wept ouer it and said o ierusalem ierusalem thou which stonest the prophets and killest them that are sent vnto thee how often would i haue gathered thy children together as the henne gathereth her chickins vnder her wings and thou wouldest not and by this he teacheth that if the preaching of the worde turne not vs to christ it turnes to our destruction the other meanes of gathering the church and that the more principall is the inward operation of the spirit whereby the minde is inlightened the heart is mollified and the whole man is conuerted to god and this ordinarily is ioyned with the ministerie or preaching of the word as appeares by the example of lydia saint luke saith god opened her heart to be attentiue to the doctrine of the apostle and by the example of paul when christ saith saul saul why persecutest thou me at this very speach he is conuerted and said who article thou lord what wilt thou that i doe and this is manifest also by experience there is nothing in the world more contrarie to the nature of man then the preaching of the word for it is the wisdome of god to which the flesh is enimitie here then it may be demaunded how it can be in force to turne any man to god answer the word preached is the scepter of christs kingdome which against the nature of man by the operation of the h ghost ioyned therewith doth bend and bowe the heart will and affections of man to the will of christ the second worke of christ is after the church is gathered to guide it in the way to life euerlasting he is the shepheard of his church which guideth his flocke in and out and therefore paul saith they that are christs are guided by his spirit and by esay the lord saith those his servant which are turned from idolatry he will guide in the way and their eares shall heare a voice behinde them saying this is the way walke in it when thou turnest to the right hand and to the left which voice is nothing els but the voice of the h ghost in the mouth of the ministers directing them in the waies of god the children of israel were trauailing from egypt to the lande of canaan full fourtie yeares whereas they might haue gone the iourney in fourtie daies their way was through the wildernesse of arabia their guides were a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night the manner of their iourney was this when the pillars mooued they mooued when the pillars stood still they stood still and so long as the pillars either mooued or stood still they likewise mooued or stood still and by all this a further matter namly the regimet of christ ouer his church was signified euery one of vs are as passengers and trauailers not to any earthly canaan but to the heauenly ierusalem and in this iourney we are to passe through the wide and desert wildernes of this world our guide is christ himselfe figured by the pillar of fire and the cloud because by his word and spirit he shewes vs how farre we may goe in euery action and where we must stand and he goes before vs as our guide to life euerlasting the third worke of christ is to exercise his church vnto spirituall obedience by manifold troubles crosses temptations and afflictions in this world as earthly kings vse to traine and exercise their subiects when our sauiour christ was with his disciples in a shippe there arose a great tempest vpon the sea so as the shippe was almost couered with waues but he was asleepe and his disciples came and awoke him saying saue vs master we perish behold here a liuely picture of the dealing of christ with his servant in this life his manner is to place them vpon the sea of this worlde and to raise vp against them bleake stormes and flaes of contrarie windes by their enemy the flesh the deuill the world and further in the middest of all these daungers he for his owne part makes as though he lay asleepe for a time that he may the better make triall of their patience faith and obedience and the endes for which hee vseth this spirituall exercise are these the first to make all his subiects to humble themselues and as it were to goe crooked and buckle vnder their offences committed against his maiestie in time past thus iob after the lorde had long afflicted him and laide his hande sore vpon him saith behold i am vile and againe i abhorre my selfe and repent in dust and ashes in the same manner we beeing his subiects and people must looke to be exercised with temptations and afflictions which shall make vs bende and bow for our sinnes past as the old man goeth crooked and doubles to the earth by reason of age the second is to preuent sinnes in the time to come a father when he sees his child too bold and venterous about fire and water takes it and holds it ouer the fire or ouer the water as though he would burne or drowne it whereas his purpose indeede is nothing els but to preuent danger for the time to come in like maner christs subiects are bold to sinne by nature and therefore to preuent a mischiefe he doth exercise them with affliction amp seemes for a season as though he would quite forsake his church but his meaning is onely to preuent offences in times to come the third end is to cotinue his subiects in obediece vnto his comandemets so the lord saith when he would bring his church fro idolatry behold i will stop thy way with thorns amp make an hedge that shee shal not find her paths the h ghost here borrows a coparison fro beast which going in the way see green pastures amp desire to enter in and therefore goe to the hedge but feeling the sharpnes of the thornes dare not adventure to goe in so god people like vnto wild beast in respect of sinne vewing the greene pastures of this world which are the pleasures thereof are greatly affected there with and if it were not for the sharpnes of crosses and temptations which are god spirituall hedge by which he keepeth them in they would range out of the way and rush into sinne as the horse into the battell the fourth and last worke of christ in respect of his church is that he sits at the right hand of his father to defend the same against the rage of all enemy whatsoeuer they are and this he doth two waies first by giuing to his servant sufficient strength to beare all the assaults of their enemy the world the flesh and the deuill for paul saith those to whome the lord hath giuen the gift of faith to them he hath also giuen this gift to suffer afflictions and the same apostle also praieth for the colossians that they may be strengthened with all might through his glorious power vnto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnes the euidence hereof we may most plainly see in the most constant death of the martyrs of christ recorded both in the word of god and in the church history it is wonderfull to see their courage and constancie for at such times as they haue beene brought to exequution they refused to be bounde or chained willingly suffering most cruell torments without shrinking or feare such courage and strength the lord gaue them to withstand the violent rage of all their aduersaries secondly he defends his church by limiting the power and rage of all enemy and hence it is that although the power of the church of god on earth be weake amp slender in it selfe amp contrariwise the power of the devil exceeding great yet can he not so much as touch the people of god and he more preuailes by inward suggestions and temptations then by outward violence and if it were not the power of christ that doth bridle his rage there were no abode for the church of christ in this world thus we haue seene what are the workes of christ in gouerning his church and we that professe our selues to be members thereof must shew our selues to be so indeed by an experience of these workes of his in our owne hearts and we must suffer him to gather vs vnder his owne wing and to guide vs by his word amp spirit amp we are to acquaint our selues with those spirituall exercises whereby his good pleasure is to nurture vs to all obedience lastly we must depend on his ayde and protection in all estates and seeing we in this land haue had peace and rest with the gospell of christ among vs a long time by god especiall goodnes we must now after these daies of peace looke for daies of tribulation we must not imagine that our ease and libertie will continue alwaies for looke as the day and night doe one follow another so likewise in the administration of the church here vpon earth christ suffereth a continuall intercourse betweene peace and persecution thus he hath done from the beginning hitherto and we may resolue our selues that so it will continue till the end and therefore it shall be good for vs in these daies of our peace to prepare our selues for troubles and afflictions and when troubles come we must still remember the fourth worke of christ in the gouernment of his church namely that in all daungers he will defend vs against the age of our enemy as well by giuing vs power amp stregth to beare with patience and ioy whatsoeuer shall be laide vpon vs as also bridle the rage of the world the flesh and the deuill so as they shall not be able to exercise their power and malice to the full against vs thus much of the dealing of christ toward his owne church and people nowe followeth the second point namely his dealing toward his enemy and here by enemy i vnderastd al creatures but especially me that as they are by nature enemy to christ and his kingdome so they perseuere in the same enimitie vnto the end now his dealing towards them is in his good time to work their confusion as he himselfe saith those mine enemy that would not that i should raigne ouer them bring them hither and slay them before me and dauid saith the lord will bruise his enemy with a rodde of iron and breake them in pieces like a potters ve sell and againe i will make thine enemy thy footestoole as iosuah dealt with the fiue kings that were hidde in the cave he first makes a slaughter of their armies then he brings them foorth and makes the people to set their feete on their neckes and to hang them on fiue trees so christ deales with his enemy he treads them vnder his feete and makes a slaughter not so much of their body as of their soules and this the church of god findes to be true by experience as wel as it findes the loue of christ towards it selfe now he confounds his enemy two waies the first is by hardnes of heart which ariseth when god withdraweth his grace from man and leaueth him to himself so as he goeth on forward from sinne to sinne and neuer repenteth to the last gaspe and we must esteeme of it as a most fearefull and terrible iudgement of god for when the heart is possessed there with it becomes so flintie and rebellious that a man will neuer relent and turne to god this is manifest in pharao for though god sent most grieuous plagues both vpon him and all the land of egypt yet would he not submit himself saue only for a fit while the had of god was vpon him but after he returned to the former obstinacie in which he continued till he was drowned in the sea and this iudgement of god is the more fearefull because when a man is in the middest of all his miserie he feeles no miserie and as in some kinde of sicknes a man may die languishing so where hardnes of heart raignes wholly and finally a man may descend to the pit of hell triumphing and reioycing and to come neere to our selues it is to be feared least this iudgement of all iudgements be among vs in these our daies for where is any turning to god by repentance still man goe forward in sinne without remorse we haue had the word preached among vs a long time but it taketh no place in mens hearts they are not softned with the hamer of god word nay they are like the smith stithie or anvil which the more it is beate with the hammer the harder it is but in the feare of god let vs seeke to be changed and take heede the deceitfulnes of sinne is wonderfull let vs not be caried away with an ouerweening of our selues a man may haue good gifts of god as the gift of knowledge the gift of prophecie the gift of conceiuing a praier i say not of praying truly and hereupon think himselfe in good case and yet for all this haue nothing but an impenitent amp flintie heart for this cause it standes euery man vpon to looke vnto it least this iudgement of god take hold on him and that we may auoide the same we must labour for two things i to feele the heauie burden of our sinnes and be touched in conscience for them euen as we are troubled in our body with the aches and paines thereof this is a token of grace ii we must labour to feele in our owne soules the want of christ we say indeede that we feele it but it is a very great matter to haue an heart that doth open it selfe and as it were gape after christ as the drie amp thirstie lande where no water is though we haue knowledge and learning neuer so much and many other gifts of god yet if we haue not broken hearts that feele the burden of our sinnes and the want of christ and that we stand in neede of euery droppe of his blood for the washing away of all these our sinnes our case is miserable and the rather we must preuet this hardnes of heart because christ iesus in heauen sits at the right hand of his father in full power and authoritie to kill amp confound all those that be his enemy amp will not submit theselues to beare his yoke the second way is by finall desperation i say finall because all kinde of desperation is not euill for when a man despaireth of himselfe and of his owne power in the matter of his saluation it tends to his eternall comfort but finall desperation is when a man vtterly despaires of the pardon of his owne sinnes and of life euerlasting examples hereof we haue in saul that slue himselfe and in achitophel and iudas that hanged themselues this sinne is caused thus so many sinnes as a man committeth without repentance so many most bloodie woundes he giueth vnto his owne soule and either in death or life god makes him feele the smart and the huge weight of them all whereby the soule sinkes downe into the gulfe of despaire withou recouerie god said to caine if thou doe amisse sinne lieth at thy dore where he vseth a borrowed speach from wilde beast who so long as they are sleeping stirre not but beeing awaked they flie in a mans face amp rend out his throat in like manner the sinnes which thou committest lie at the dore of thine heart though thou feele them not and if thou doe not preuent the daunger by speedie repentance god will make thee to feele them once before thou die and raise vp such terrours in thy conscience that thou shalt thinke thy selfe to be in hell before thou article in hell and therefore it is good for euery man to take heede howe he continues an enemie to christ the best course is to turne betime from our sinnes and become the friends of christ that so we may escape these fearefull iudgements and whereas christ in this manner gouernes all things in heauen and earth we are bound to performe vnto him three duties reuerence obedience thankfulnes for the first paul saith god hath exalted him and giuen him a name aboue all names that at the name of iesus which name is his exaltation in heauen in full power and glorie should euery knee bowe we dare not so much as speake of an earthly king vnreuerently what reuerence then doe we owe vnto christ the king of heauen and earth dauids heart was touched in that he had cut off but the lappe of sauls garment when he might haue slaine him because he was the lord annointed oh then howe much more ought our hearts to be touched if we shall in the least measure dishonour christ iesus our lord and king secondly we are here taught to performe obedience to him and to do him all the homage we can the master of the familie in all his lawful commaundements must be obeied now the church of christ is a familie therfore we must yeild obedience to him in al things for al his comandemets are iust whe saul was chosen king ouer israel certain man which feared god whose hearts god had touched followed him to gibea amp brought him presents but the wicked despised him the same is much more to be verified in vs towarde christ our lord we must haue our hearts touched with desire to performe obedience vnto him if not we are man of belial that despise him and refuse to bring our presents vnto him if this obedience were put in practise the gospell would haue better successe in the hearts of the people and the lord sabbath would be better kept and man would beare greater loue both to god and to their neighbours then now they doe the third dutie which we owe vnto him is thankfulnes for the endlesse care which he sheweth in the gouerning and preseruing of vs vvhen dauid waxed old and had made salomon his son king in his stead all the people shouted and cried god saue king salomon god saue king salomon so as the earth rang againe shall the people of israel thus reioyce at the crowning of salomon amp shal not we much more reioyce when as christ iesus is placed in heauen at the right hand of his father and hath the euerlasting scepter of his kingdome put into his hand and we are to shew this thankfulnes vnto him by doing any thing in this world that may tend to his honour and glorie though it be with the adventure of our liues vvhen dauid desired to drinke of the water of the well of bethlem three of his mightie man went and brake into the host of the philistims and brought him water thus they ventured their liues for dauids sake and shall not we much more willingly venture our liues to doe christ seruice in token of thankfulnes for his continuall preseruing of vs thus much of the highest degree of christs exaltation in his kingdome now followeth the last point to be beleeued concerning christ in these words from then e he shall come to iudge the quicke and the deade and they containe a proofe or a particular declaration of the former article for as on earth those that are set at the right hand of kings doe execute iustice in courts or assises for the maintenance of the state and peace of the kingdome so christ iesus sitting at the right hande of his father that is being made soueraigne lord of all things both in heauen amp earth is to hold a court or assise in which he shall come to iudge both the quicke and the dead now in handling the last iudgement we are to consider these points i whether there shall be a iudgement or not ii the time of it iii the signes therof iv the manner of it v the vse which is to be made thereof of these in order for the first point whether there shall be a iudgement or not the question is needefull for as saint peter saith there shall come in the last daies mockers which shall walke after their lusts and say where is the promise of his comming which daies are now the answeare is set downe in this article in which we professe that the coming of christ to the last iudgement is a point of religion specially to be held and auouched the reasons to prooue it are principally two first the testimonie of god himselfe in the books of the old and new testament which affoard vnto vs plentifull testimonies touching the last iudgement so as he which will but lightly reade the same shall not neede to doubt thereof the second reason is taken from the iustice and goodnes of god the propertie wherof is to punish wicked and vngodly man and to honour and reward the godly but in this world the godly ma is most of al in misery for iudgement beginneth at god house and the vngodly haue their hearts ease wicked diues hath the world at will but pore lazarus is hunger bitten full of soares amp miserable euery way this being so it remaineth that after this life there must needes be a iudgement and a second comming of christ when the godly must receiue fulnes of ioy amp glorie and the vngodly fulnes of woe and miserie this second reason may stoppe the mouthes of all gainesayers in the worlde whatsoeuer but it may be obiected that the whole world stands either of beleeuers or vnbeleeuers and that there is no last iudgement for either of these for the beleeuer as christ saith hath euerlasting life amp shal not come into iudgement and the vnbeleeuer is condemned alreadie and therefore needeth no further iudgement answer where it is said he that beleeueth shall not come into iudgement it must be vnderstood of the iudgement of condemnation amp not the iudgement of absolution amp he that beleeueth not is condemned alreadie in effect amp substance three waies i in the counsel of god who did foresee amp appoint his condemnation as it is a punishment of sinne and an execution of his iustice ii in the word of god where he hath his condemnation set down iii he is condemned in his own conscience for euery vngodly mans conscience is a iudge vnto himselfe which doth euery houre condemne him and it is a forerunner of the last iudgement and notwithstading all this there may remain a second iudgement which is a manifestatio amp finishing of that which was begu in this world amp therefore the meaning of that place is this he that beleeueth not is alreadie iudged in part but so as the full manifestation thereof shall be at the second comming of christ the second circumstance is the time of his iudgement in handling whereof i we will see what is the iudgement of man ii what is the truth for the first two opinions touching this time take place the first is that the second comming of christ shall be about sixe thousand yeares from the beginning of the world amp that for the elects sake some of these daies must be shortned amp now since the beginning of the world are passed fiue thousand amp almost sixe hudred yeares so as there remaine but foure hundreds the grouds of this opinion are these first the testimonie of elijah two thousand yeares before the law two thousand yeares vnder the law and two thousand yeres vnder christ and for the elects sake some of these yeares shalbe shortned answer this was not the sentece of elijah the thisbite but of another elijah which was a iew no prophet and wheras he saith two thousand yeares before the law amp two thousand yeres vnder the law he faileth from the giuing of the law to the comming of christ was about one thousand amp fiue hundred yeares and from the law to the creation aboue two thousand now if elijah can not set downe a iust number for the time past which a meane man may doe what shall we think that he can doe for the time to come and if he deceiue vs in that which is more easie to finde howe shall wee trust him in things that be harder the second reason is this howe long god was in creating the worlde so long he shall be in gouerning the same but he was sixe daies in creating the worlde and in the seuenth he rested and so proportionally he shall be sixe thousand yeares in gouerning the world euery day answearing to a thousand yeares as peter saith a thousand yeares are but as one day with god and then shall the ende be answer this reason likewise hath no ground in god word as for that place of peter the meaning is that innumerable yeares are but as a short time with god and we may as well say two thousand or tenne thousand yeares are but as one day with god for peter meant not to speake any thing distinctly of a thousand yeares but of a long time thirdly it is alleadged that within sixe thousand yeares from the creation of the worlde shall appeare in the heauens straunge coniunctions and positions of the starres which signifie nothing else but the subversion of the state of the world nay some haue noted that the ende thereof should haue beene in the yeare of our lord a thousand fiue hundred eightie eight their writings are manifest but we finde by experience that this opinion is false and friuolous and their groundes be as friuolous for no man can gather by the ordinarie course of the heauens the extraordinarie change of the whole world the second is that the end of the world shall be three yeares and an halfe after the reuealing of antichrist and it is gathered out of places in daniel and the revelation abused where a time and times and half a time signifie not three yeares and an halfe but a short time and therefore to take the words properly is farre from the meaning of the holy ghost for marke if the end shall be three yeares amp an halfe after the reuealing of antichrist then may any man knowe before hand the particular moneth wherein the ende of the world should be which is not possibl now the truth which is to be auouched against all is this that no man can know or set downe or coniecture the day the weeke the moneth the yeare or the age wherein the second comming of christ and the last day of iudgement shall be for christ himselfe saith of that day and houre knoweth no man no not the angels in heauen but god onely nay christ himselfe as he is man knoweth it not and when the disciples asked christ at his ascensio whether he would restore the kingdo vnto israel he answered it is not for you to know the times and seasons which the father hath put in his owne power and paul saith of the times and seasons brother you haue no neede that i write vnto you for you your selues kn w perfectly that the day of the lord shall come euen as a thiefe in the night now we know tha a man that keepeth his house can not coniecture or imagine when a thiefe will come and therefore no man can set downe the particular time or age when christ shal come to iudgement this must we hold steadfastly and if wee reade the contrarie in the writings of man we are not to beleeue their sayings but accout of them as of the deuices of me which haue no ground in god word to come to the third point namely the signes of the last iudgement they are of two sorts some goe before the comming of christ and some are ioyned with it the signes that goe before are in number seuen recorded distinctly by the holy ghost the first is the preaching of the gospell through the whole worlde so our sauiour christ saith this gospell of the kingdome must be preached through the whole world for a witnesse vnto all nation and then shall the ende come which place must thus be vnderstoode not that the gospell must be preached to the whole world at any one time for that as i take it was neuer yet seene neither shalbe but that it shall be published distinctly and successiuely at seuerall times and thus vnderstanding the words of christ if we consider the time since the apostles daies we shall finde this to be true that the gospell hath bin preached to all the world and therefore this first signe of christs comming is alreadie past and accomplished the second signe of his comming is the reuealing of antichrist as paul saith the day of christ shall not come before there be a departure first and that man of sinne be disclosed euen the son of perdition which is antichrist concerning this signe in the yeare of our lord gregorie the eight pope of rome auouched this solemnly as a manifest that whosoeuer did take to him selfe the name of vniuersall bishop the same was antichrist now fiue yeares after boniface succeeding him was by p ocas the emperour entituled vniversall bishop pastor of the catholicke church in the yeare of our lord amp of all popes he was the first knowne antichrist amp since him all his successours haue taken vnto them the same title of vniuersall amp catholick bishop whereby it doth plainly appeare that at rome hath bin and is the antichrist and this signe is also past the third is a generall departing of most man from the faith for it is said in the place before named let no man deceiue you for the day of christ shall not come except there come a departing first generall departure hath bin in former ages when arius spied his heresie it tooke such place that the whole world became an arian and during the space of yeares from the time of boniface the popish heresie spread it selfe ouer the whole earth and the faithful servant of god were but as an handfull of wheat in a mountaine of chaffe which can scarce be discerned this signe is in part alreadie past neuerthelesse it shall continue to the ende because man shall continually depart from the faith and the nearer the ende of the world is the more satan rageth and seekes to bring man into his kingdome therefore it standeth vs in hand to labour for the knowledge of true religion and hauing learned it most heartily to loue the same the fourth signe is a generall corruption in maners this point the apostle sets downe at large saying toward the latter daies shall come perilous times wherein man shalbe louers of themselues couetous boasters proud cursed speakers disobediet to parents vnthankefull vnholy and without naturall affection truce breakers false accusers intemperate fierce despisers of them which are good traytours headie high minded louers of pleasures more then louers of god ampc this generall corruption in the manners of man is noted by our sauiour christ when he saith when he commeth he shall scarce finde faith vpon the earth this signe hath bin in former ages and is no doubt at this day in the world for it is hard to finde a man that walketh iustly soberly and faithfully doing the duties of his calling to god and man the fifth signe of christs comming stands in terrible amp grieuous calamities for christs disciples asking him a signe of his coming amp of the end of the world he saith there shal be war amp rumours of war nation shall rise against nation amp realme against realme and there shalbe p stilence and famine amp earthquakes in diverse places amp me shalbe at their wits ends these haue bin in former ages in the first hundred yeres after christ were ten most fearefull persecutions and since in europe the church of god hath bin woderfully persecuted by the antichrist of rome in the hudred yeres last past the sixth signe is an exceeding deadnes of heart so as neither iudgements from heauen nor the preaching of the word shall mooue the hearts of man so christ saith it shal be in the coming of the son of ma as it was in the daies of noe amp in the daies of sodo they knew nothing til the flood came amp fire fro heaue destroied the all this signe undoubtedly is manifest in these our daies howsoeuer it hath bin also in former times for where are any almost that are moued with god iudgements or touched at the preaching of the word nay rather man harde their hearts amp become secure and careles the small fruit that the word of god bringeth foorth in the liues of man shews this to be most true the seuenth amp last signe set down by the apostle paul is that there shall be a calling of the iewes before the lord come to iudgemet but of the time whe this calling shal be of the maner how or the number of them that shalbe called there is no mention made in the word of god now it is likely that this signe is yet to come these are the signes that go before the coming of christ all which are almost past and therefore the end can not be farre off now follows the signe that is ioyned with the coming of christ called the signe of the son of man what this signe is we find not in the scriptures some thinke it to be the signe of the crosse but that is friuolous some the glorie amp maiestie of christ which shal be made manifest in his appearance which seemes to be otherwise by the very words of christ then saith he shall appeare the signe of the son of man ampc and then they shall see him come in the cloudes of heauen vvith povver and great glorie distinguishing the one from the other but i rather coniecture it to be the burning of heauen and earth with fire at the very instant of christs comming mentioned by peter vve must not here dispute whence this fire shal come or how it shall be kindled for that the word of god hath concealed and where god hath not a mouth to speake there we must not haue an eare to heare the vses to be made hereof are these vvhen s peter had set downe the change that shall be at the comming of christ and that heauen and earth must be purged with fire he makes this vse thereof seeing all things must be dissolued what manner of man ought we to be in holy conuersation amp godlines and the reason is good for if heauen amp earth must be changed and purged at christs comming then much more ought we to be changed amp to put off the old man of sinne amp to become new creatures created after the image of god in righteousnes and true holines if the bruit creatures must be renewed by fire then much more are we to labour that the fire of god spirite may burne vp sinne amp corruption in vs amp so change vs that we may be ready for him against his coming els heaue amp earth it selfe shal stand vp in iudgemet against vs to our condemnation secondly the consideration of this that the world shall be consumed with fire teacheth vs moderation and sobrietie in the vse of god creatures as in costly buildings gorgeous attire and such like vvhat madnes is this to bestow all that we haue on such things as at the day of iudgement shall be consumed with fire for looke whatsoeuer abuse shall come to god creatures by our follie the same shal then be abolished thirdly we must consider that the cause why heauen amp earth must be consumed with fire is mans sinne by means wherof they are made subiect to vanitie amp corruption here the we haue iust occasion to acknowledge the greatnes amp wretchednes of our sinnes if any of vs had but seene the iewes leprosie it would haue made vs to woder for the contagion thereof did infect not only the whole ma but his garmets also that were about him amp somtime the walls of his house but howsoeuer we canot now see that leprosie amog vs yet we may see a worse for the leprosie of our sins doth not onely infect our garmets amp the things about us with our body but euen the high heaues amp the earth are slained with the contagion thereof and are made subiect to vanitie and corruption yes by sinne in us the most glorious creatures in them as the sun moone and starres are become subiect to vanitie oh then how wretched is the heart of man that makes no bones of sinne which is the most noisome thing in all the worlde the stinke whereof hath infected both heauen and earth if we could consider this we would not be so slacke in humbling our selues for the same as wee are wee can not abide to looke on a poore lazar full of blanes and sores but if wee could see our sinnes in their right colours they would make us seem unto our selues ten thousad times more ougly then any lazar man can be the contagio thereof is so great amp noisome that the verie heauens which are many thousand miles distant from us are infected therwith yet here we are to know that this fire shall not consume the substance of heauen and earth but onely change the qualitie and abolish the corruption which our sinnes haue brought upon them the fourth point to be considered is the manner of the last iudgement in which wee may obserue two things i who shall be iudge ii the proceeding of this iudge the first is expressed in this article from thence hee shall come to iudge hee that is christ iesus the second person in trinitie for the father hath committed all iudgement unto him it is indeede an action common to all the three persons in trinitie but yet the execution thereof appertaines unto the son the father indeed doth iudge the world but yet by the son but some may obiect that the apostles shall sit on velve thrones and iudge the twelve tribes of israel and s paul saith the saintes shall iudge the world how then is this true that christ is the onely iudge of the world answer the authoritie of iudgement and giuing sentence at the last day is proper to christ alone and doth not belong either to the apostles or to the saints and they shall iudge at the last day only as witnesses and apprpouers of christs iudgement at the great day of assise beside the iudge the iustices on the bench are also in a maner iudges not that they giue sentence but because by their presence they approoue and witnesse the equitie of the sentence of the iudge so the definitive sentence doth belong to christ and the apostles and saintes doe nothing but approoue his righteous sentence the whole proceeding of the last iudgement may be reduced to seuen pointes or heades the first is the comming of the iudge in the cloudes here at the first it may be demaunded why christ holdes the last iudgement rather on earth then in heauen ansvver he doth it for two causes one the creature to be iudged hath sinned here upon earth and he proceeds after the maner of earthly iudges who hold their sessions and assises there where trespasses are commonly committed the seconde because the deuill and his angels are to be iudged and it is a parte of their punishment to be cast out of heauen for no uncleane thing may come into this heauenly ierusalem and therefore they now remaine in the lower parts of the world amp there must be iudged furthermore the second comming of christ is sudden as the comming of a thiefe in the night he will come when the worlde thinketh not of him as the snare doeth on the birde the consideration whereof must teach us the same duties which our sauiour christ taught the man of his time first hee teacheth them what they must not doe for hee knowing all things knewe also the disposition of mans heart and therefore saieth take heede to your selves least at any time your hearts be oppressed vvith surfetting and drunkennesse and the cares of this life least that day come vpon you unavvares for these sinnes benumme the heart and steale away all grace this exhortation in these our daies is most needefull for mens heartes are like the smith sti hie the more they are beaten with the hammer of god worde the harder they are secondly hee teacheth them what they must doe watch therefore saieth hee and pray continually that yee may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to passe and that ye may stand before the son of man but you will say how may wee be founde worthy to stande before christ at that day answere doe but this one thing for your liues past be humbled before god and come unto him by true hearty and unfained repentance be changed and become newe creatures pray unto him earnestly for the pardon of your sinnes in christ and pray continually that god will turne your heartes from your olde sinnes euerie day more and more and then come the last iudgement when it will ye shall be founde worthy to stand before christ at his comming the repentant sinner is hee that shall finde fauour in the sight of god at that day the consideration hereof may mooue us to change our liues those which were neuer yet humbled for their sinnes let them now begin and those which haue alreadie begon let them goe forwarde and continue but the deuill will crie in the hearts of some man that this exhortation is as yet needelesse for the day of iudgement is not neare because all the signes thereof are not yet passed answere suppose the day of iudgement be farre off yet the day of thy death can not be so for the common saying is true to day a man to morrow none now looke as death leaveth thee so shall the day of iudgement finde thee impenitent cain died long since and yet the day of iudgement when it commeth shall finde him impenitent still the same thing may be saide of saul achitophel and iudas they died desperately and impenitent and the lord shall finde them so at his comming so it will be with thee whatsoeuer thou article that repentest not death may come upon thee the next day or the next houre therefore watch and pray prepare thy selfe against the day of death that at the day of iudgement thou maiest be ounde worthy to obtaine fauour in the sight of the lorde securitie doeth ouerwhelme the vvorlde but let us for our parts learne to prepare our selues daily for if the day of death do leaue thee unworthy then the lord iesus at his comming shall find thee unworthy and the deuill shal stand before thee amp accuse thee thy conscience shall condemne thee amp hell shalbe ready to swallow thee up if this admonition take no place in thy heart then at the day of iudgement it shall stand against thee and be a bill of inditement to thy further condemnation the second point followeth that christ after that hee is come in the cloudes shall sit in a throne of glorie as the soueraigne iudge of heauen and earth after the manner of earthly kings who when they will shew themselues unto their subiectes in maiestie power and glorie use to ascende into the thrones of their kingdomes and there to shewe themselues and appeare in state vnto all the people now what this throne is and how christ sittes in the same the scripture hath not revealed and therefore i will not stand to search yet here must we further marke that this appearance of his in endlesse glory and maiestie shalbe most terrible and dreadfull to the ungodly and therefore in daniel his throne is said to be like a flame of fire and at the verie sight hereof man shall desire the mountaines to fall upon them and the hilles to couer them the third point is the citing of all man and of the angels before his maiestie in that daie there to answer for themselues this citing shall be done by the voice of christ as he himselfe saith in that day all that are in the graues shall heare his voice and they shall come forth and here we are to consider two things i the power of this voice ii the ministerie whereby it shall be uttered for the first no doubt the power of this voice shall be unspeakable and therefore it is compared to a trumpet the loudest and shrillest of all musicall instrumentes and to the crie of the mariners whose manner hath bene in the doing of any businesse with all their strength at one instant to make a common shout and sensible experience shall manifest the force thereof for it shall cause all the deade euen from the beginning of the worlde to rise againe though they haue lien rotten in the earth many thousande yeres and all uncleane spirites shall be forced and compelled will they nill they to come before christ who shalbe unto them a most fearefull and terrible iudge neither man nor angell shal be able to absent or hide himselfe all without exception must appeare as well high as low rich as poore none shalbe able to withdraw themselues no not the mightie monarches of the earth furthermore this voice shall be uttered by angels as in the church christ useth man as his ministers by whome he speakes unto his people so at the last day he shall use the ministerie of angels whome hee shall sende forth into the foure windes to gather his elect togither and therefore it is likely that this voice shalbe uttered by them and by this which hath bene saide we must be mooued to make conscience of all sinne for there is no avoiding of this iudgement we can not absent our selues no excuse will serue the turne euen the most rebellious of all creatures whether ma or angell shall be forced to appeare and therefore it stands us in hand while wee haue time in this life to looke unto our estates and to practise the duties of christianitie that when we shall be cited before his glorious maiestie at the last day we may be cleared and absolued the fourth point is the separation of the sheepe from the goates the good from the bad for when all the kinreds of the earth amp all uncleane spirits shall stand before christ sitting in the throne of his glorie then as a good shepheard hee shall separate them one from another the righteous from the wicked amp the elect from the reprobate he which knoweth the heartes of all man knoweth also how to doe this and he will doe it this full and finall separation is reserued to christ and shall not be accomplished till the last day for so it is in the parable that the tares must grow with the wheate till haruest and then the reapers must separate them and gather the wheate into the barne but the tares must be burned with unquenchable fire by the consideration of this one point wee learne diverse things i that in the church of god in this world good and badde are mingled togither elect and reprobate and we are not to imagine any perfection of the church of god upon earth as many haue dreamed which when they could not find they haue therefore forsaken all assemblies i confesse indeede that the preaching of the word is the lord fanne whereby he clenseth his church in part but yet the finishing of this worke shall not be before the last iudgement for when the ministers of god haue done all that they can yet shall the wicked be mingled with the godly therefore the church is compared to a barne store where is both wheate and chaffe amp a corne field where there is both tares and good corne and a draw net wherein is both good fish and bad secondly whereas this separation must not be before the end of the world hence we learne the state of god church in this life it is like a flock of sheep mingled with goates amp therefore the condition of god people in this worlde is to be troubled many waies by those with whome they liue for goates use to strike the sheepe to annoy their pasture amp to make their water muddie that they can not drinke of it therefore wee must prepare our selues to beare all annoiances crosses and calamities that shall befall us in this world by the wicked ones among whome we liue thirdly we are taught that howsoeuer the goates and the sheepe be very like amp feed in one pasture amp lie in one fold all their life time yet christ can amp will seuer them asunder at the last day therefore considering as wee are borne of adam wee haue the nature of the goate yes of the wild beast amp not of the sheep it stands us in hand to lay aside our goatish conditions and to take unto us the properties of the sheepe of christ which hee expresseth in these wordes my sheepe saith he heare my voice i know them amp they follow me and the properties are three to know him to be known of him and to follow him namely in obedience and he that finds them all in himselfe weareth the brand and marke of the true sheepe of christ but contrariwise they that make profession of christ amp yet therewithall ioyne not obedience howsoeuer the worlde may account of them they are but goates amp no sheep let us therefore with the knowledge of christ ioyne obedience to his word that when the day shall come that the goats must be separated from the sheep we may be found to be in the nuber of the true sheep of christ wee may deceiue man both in life amp death amp beare them in hand that we are sheepe but when the iudgement shall come we can not deceiue christ he it is that formed us he knowes our harts amp therfore ca easily discern what we are the fift thing is the triall of euery mans particular cause a point especially to be considered for as at the barre of an earthly iudge the malefactour is brought out of prison and set before the iudge and there examined euen so in that great day shall euery man without exception be brought before the lord to be tried but how shal this trial be made ans by workes as the apostle saith wee must all appeare before the iudgement seate of christ that every man may receiue the thinges vvhich are done in his body according to that hee hath done whether it be good or evil and the reason is because workes are the outward signes of inward grace and godlinesse and though we be iustified by faith alone without workes yet may we be iudged both by faith and workes for the last iudgement doeth not serue to make man iust that are not but onely to manifest them to be iust indeed which were iust before and in this life truely iustified the consideration of this very point should moue us all to repent us of our sins past amp to reforme our selues throughout amp to be plentifull in all good works and undoubtedly if wee seriously thinke upon it it will holde us more straitly to all good duties then if with the papistes we held iustification by workes furthermore in this triall tvvo things must be skanned i how all mens workes shall be made manifest ii by what meanes they shall be examined of the manifestation of euery mans vvork s john speaketh and i saw saith he the deade both great and small stande before god and the bookes were opened and another booke was opened which is the booke of life and the dead were iudged of these things which vvere written in the bookes according to their workes god is saide to haue books not properly but because al things are as certen and manifest to him as if he had his registers in heauen to keepe rolles and recordes of them his bookes are three the book of prouidence the book of iudgement the book of life the book of his providence is the knowledge of all particular things past present to come of this the psalmist speaketh thine eyes did see me when i vvas vvithout forme for in thy booke vvere all things vvritten vvhich in continuance vvere fashioned vvhen there was none of them before the booke of iudgement is that whereby he giues iudgement and it is two folde the first is god knowledge or prescience in which all the affaires of man their thoughts wordes and deedes are as certenly knowen and set downe as if they were put in bookes of record wee may forget our sinnes but god keepes them in a register he knovves them euery one the seconde booke is euery mans particular conscience which also brings to remembrence and testifies what man haue done and what they haue not done the booke of life is nothing els but the decree of god election in which god hath set downe who be ordained to life eternall now the opening of these bookes is a thing wherin the endlesse power of god shall most notably shewe it selfe for when we shall stand before the iudgement seate of christ he then knowing all things in his eternall counsell shall reueale unto euery man his owne particular sinnes whether they were in thought worde or deede and then also by his mightie power hee shall so touch mens consciences that they shall a fresh remember what they haue done now indeede the wicked mans conscience is shut up as a closed booke but then it shall be so touched and as it were opened that he shall plainly see and remember all the particular offences which at any time he hath committed amp his very coscience shall be as good as a thousand witnesses whereupon hee shall accuse and utterly condemne himselfe the consideration of this ought to terrifie all those that liue in their sinnes for howsoeuer they may hide them from the worlde yet at the last day god will be sure to reveale them all now after that mens workes are made manifest they must further be tried whether they be good or euill and that shall be done on this maner they that neuer heard of christ must be tried by the law of nature which serues to make them inexcusable before god as for those that liue in the church they shall be tried by the law and the gospell as paul saith as many as have lived in the law shall be iudged by the law and againe at the day of iudgement god shall iudge the secrets of our hearts according to his gospell and by faith noah builded an arke whereby he condemned the olde world if this be true then we must in the feare of god heare his word preached amp taught with all reuerence amp make coscience to profit by it for otherwise in the day of iudgement when all our workes shalbe tried by it the same word of god shall be a bill of indi ement and the fearefull sentence of condemnation against us therefore let us be humbled by the doctrine of the lawe and willingly embrace the sweete promises of the gospell considering it is the onely touchstone whereby all our wordes thoughts amp workes must be examined the sixt pointe in the proceeding of the last iudgement is the giuing of sentence which is twofolde the sentence of absolution and the sentence of condemnation both which are to be obserued diligently that we may receiue profit therby and first of al christ shal begin his iudgemet with the setece of absolutio which shews that he is ready to shew mercy amp slow to wrath in this sentence wee are to consider foure pointes i a calling of the elect to the kingdome of heauen ii the reason thereof iii a reply of the elect iv the answere of christ to them againe the calling of the elect is set downe in these wordes come yee blessed of my father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world and the wordes are to be obserued one by one come ye blessed though christ now sit in glorie and maiestie in iudgement yet hee ceaseth not to shew his tender affection of loue unto his chosen and this ouerthroweth the opinion of the church of rome which would haue us rather to come vnto christ by the intercession of saints then by our selues immediatly because he is now exalted in glorie and maiestie but mark when he was heare on earth hee saide come vnto me all yee that are heavy laden and i vvill ease you and when hee shall be most glorious in maiestie and power at the day of iudgement hee will then also say come ye blessed of my father and therfore we may resolue our selues that it is his will now that we should come unto him without any intercessio of saints yee blessed of my father the elect are here called the blessed of god because their righteousnes saluation and all that they haue springs of the meere blessing of god nothing therefore must be ascribed to the workes of man inherit that is receiue as your inheritance therefore the kingdome of heauen is god meere gifte a father giueth no inheritance unto his son of merite but of his free gifte whereupon it followes that no man can merit the kingdome of heauen by his workes the kingdome that is the eternall estate of glorie and happinesse in heauen therfore in this life we must so use this worlde as though we used it not all that we haue here is but vaine and transitorie and all our studie and endeauour must be to come to the kingdome of heauen prepared here note the unspeakeable care of god for the faithfull had he such care to prouide a kingdome for his children before they were then wee may assure our selues he will haue greater care ouer them now when they haue a being for you that is for the elect and faithfull hence it appeares that there is no uniuersall election whereby god decrees that all and euery man shal be saued indeed if he had said come ye blessed of my father inherite the kingdome prepared for all but received of you it had beene something but he saieth onely prepared for you and therefore all were not chosen to saluation the reason of this calling is taken from workes as from signes in these wordes for i vvas hungry and yee gave mee meate ampc when he saith for i was hungry hee meanes his poore members upon earth and thereby he signifies unto us that the miseries of his members are his owne miseries thus the lord saith in zachary he which toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye and when saul was going to persecute them that called on the name of christ in damascus hee cried from heauen saul saul why persecutest thou me and this is a notable comfort to god church and people that they haue an high priest that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities and if hee accompt our miseries his owne miseries then no doubt hee will pity our estate and make us able to beare the worst and yee gave mee meate here wee note that the principall workes of man are those which are done to the poore members of christ wee are indeed to helpe all in as much as they are our verie flesh and the creatures of god the rule of s paul being remembred doe good to all but especially to those that are of the houshold of faith many are of mind that the best works are to build churches amp monasteries but christ tells us here that the best work of all is to relieue those that be the liuing members of his mysticall body the third point is the reply of the saints to christ againe in these wordes lorde when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee ampc they doe not denie that which christ auouched but doe as i take it standing before the tribunall seat of god humble themselues hauing stil an after consideration of the infirmities and offences of their liues past here note then that it is a satanicall practise for a man to bragge of workes and to stand upon them in the matter of iustification before god and wee must rather doe as the saintes of god doe abase our selues in regard of our sinnes past the last point is the answere of christ to them againe in these wordes verily i say unto you in as much as yee did it to the least of these my breethren you did it to me a most notable sentence and it serueth to teach us how wee should and ought to behaue our selues in doing workes of mercie which are duties to bee perfourmed in this life we are not to doe them of any sinister respect as for praise of man or commodity but wee must propound unto our selues the party to whome wee doe any good and in him looke on christ and so doe it as unto christ and for christes sake onely and this is a good worke indeede christ saith whosoever shall give a cup of cold water to a disciple in the name of a disciple shall not loose his reward it is but a small gift but yet the maner of doing it namely in the name of a disciple that is in respect that he is a member of christ doth make it an excellent worke of mercie it is a speciall marke of a childe of god to shew mercy on a christian because he is a christian if any would know whether he be a christian or no let him search himselfe whether he loue a man and can doe good unto him because he is a childe of god and a member of christ for this is a plaine argument that he also is the childe of god many can loue because they are loued againe but to lo e for christ his sake is a worke of christ in us and a speciall gift of god the sentence of condemnation followes in the seconde place and it containes foure points i the reiection of the ungooly ii the reason of their reiection iii the defence which the wicked make for themselues lastly the answere of christ to them againe the reiection of the wicked is uttered by a terrible sentence away from mee yee cursed into hell fire the use hereof in generall is twofold first it serves to awake and excite all man and woman in the worlde whosoeuer they be that shall heare it to looke unto their owne estates it is wonderfull to see what great securitie reigneth euery where in these our daies man goe on in sinne from day to day and from yere to yere without repentance nothing at all fearing the sentence of condemnation at the last day like unto many which for the obtaining of other mens goods are neither by the feare of arraignment or imprisonment kept in good order the occasions of securitie are twofolde i the prosperitie of the wicked who of all man liue most at ease without trouble either in body or in minde ii god patience and long suffering as salomon saith because sentence against an evill worke is not executed speedily therefore the hearts of the children of man is fully set in them to doe evill but to avvake all those which liue in this securitie they must remember that howsoeuer the lord god doth now deferre his iudgement yet there is a day wherin he wil no way shew mercy amp long suffering when they shall heare this fearfull sentece of condenation pronounced against them away from me ye cursed the second use is to the godly it serues to nurture them amp to keep the in awe before god amp no doubt this was a principall cause why this sentence was here penned by the holy ghost a wise master of a family will checke his servant and if the cause require correct him in his childes presence that the childe it selfe may learne thereby to feare and stand in awe of his father so christ the most carefull and wise gouernour of his church hath set downe this sentence of condemnation against the wicked that the children of god in this world whensoeuer they shall heare or reade the same might be mooued thereby to stande in great feare of god and more dutifully perfourme obedience to his commaundements away from me here wee may learne what a blessed thing it is for a man to haue true fellowship with christ in this worlde for in the day of iudgement the punishment of the wicked is to be cut off from him and driuen away from his presence now hee that would haue fellowship with god after this life and escape that punishment must seeke to haue it in this life and hee that will not seeke to haue fellowship with him in this life shal neuer haue it after in the day of iudgement again let us mark that it is nothing to draw nere unto christ with our lippes if the heart be not with him for such as come nere with the lippe and haue kept aloofe in the heart shall heare the sentence pronounced away f om me ye cursed amp shall be seuered as farre from christ as hell from heauen therefore let us not content our selues with formall profession but open the dores of our heartes that the king of glory may come in yee cursed they are cursed who are borne in sinne and liue in their sinnes and all the daies of their liues so perseuere to the last gaspe without seeking recouerie whosoeuer he be that is in this estate the curse of god hangeth ouer his head and will so do till hee get reconciliation with god in christ this being so aboue all things in this world we must labor to be at peace with god and neuer cease nor be quiet with our selues till we haue the same wrought and sealed in our hearts for before such time as we be in god fauour his fearfull curse hangs ouer our heads amp if we so perseuere without repentance the day will come when we shall heare this fearefull sentence pronounced against us away from me ye cursed into hell fire what hell fire is we must not curiously search but rather giue our whole endeauour to learne how we may auoid it as when a mans house is on fire his care must be not to search how it came but rather how to quench it yet we are to know thus much that by hell fire is not meant any bodily flame but it signifies the seazing of the fearful amp terrible wrath of god both on body and soule for euer for howsoeuer the body be subiect to burning with fire yet the soule being spiritual can not burn amp therfore hell fire is not a materiall fire but a grieuous tormet fit resembled therby prepared for the divell and his angels there is in euery mas heart by nature this corruption whereby when he sinneth he thinkes that there is no daunger but all is well having as esai saieth made a covenat with hell but here consider that although the deuill was once an angell of light yet when he had sinned he could not escape hell it was prepared euen for him now then shall ungodly man which are not halfe so wily thinke to escape nowe followeth the reason of their reiection in these wordes for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meate ampc hence we learne these two points i that all mans religio amp seruing of god is in vaine if so be we shew no copassion towarde the poore members of christ in feeding clothing lodging amp visiting of them for we must thinke that many of those against whom this reason shalbe brought did know religio amp professe the same yes they prophesied in the name of christ amp called on him saying lord lord amp yet the sentence of condemnation goeth against them because they shewed no copassion toward the mebers of christ amp therfore it is a principall vertue amp a speciall note of a christian to shew the bowels of copassion towardes his needy breethren here againe we note that it is not sufficient for us to abstaine fro evil but we must also do good for it is not said i was an hungred and ye tooke meate from me but when i was hugry ye gave me no meat they are not charged with doing euill but for not doing good s john saith the axe is laid to the root of the tree amp the reason followes not because the tree bare evil fruite but because it bare not good fruit therfore it must be cast into the fire this condemnes a bad opinion of all worldly man who thinke that all is well amp that god will be mercifull unto them because they do no man harme thus we see how the deuill blindes the eyes of man for it will not stand for paiment at the day of iudgement to say i haue hurt no man unlesse we further doe all the good we can the third point is the defence which impenitent sinners make for themselues in these wordes lorde when saw we thee an hungred or thirstie or naked or in prison or sicke and did not minister unto thee thus in their owne defence that which christ saith they gainsay amp iustifie themselues here mark the nature of all impenitent sinners which is to sooth amp flat theselues in sinne amp to maintaine their own righteousnes like to the proude pharisie in his praier who bragged of his goodnes amp said lord i thanke thee that i am not as other man are extortioners ampc and in the very same manner ignorant persons of all sortes among us iustifie themselues in their strong faith and bragge of their zeale of god glory and of their loue to their brother and yet indeede shew no signes thereof and truly wee are not to maruell when we se such persons to iustifie themselues before man whereas they shall not be ashamed to doe it at the day of iudgement before the lord iesus himselfe the last point is christes answere to them againe in these wordes verily i say vnto you in as much as yee did it not to one of the least of these yee did it not to me this sentence beeing repeated againe doeth teach us the lesson which wee learned before that when wee are to shewe compassion to any man especially if hee be a member of god church we must not cosider his outward estate or his basenesse in that he vvantes foode or raiment but beholde christ in him not respecting him as a man but as a member of christ this it is that must mooue us to compassion and cause us to make a supply of his wants more the any respect in the worlde besides and surely when christ in his members comes to our do es and complaines that he is hungry and sicke and naked if our bowels came not towardes him there is not so much as a dramine of the loue of god in vs the seventh point in the proceeding of the last iudgement is the retribution or reward in these words and they shall goe into everlasting paine and the righteous into life eternall how doe the wicked enter into hell and the godly into heaven answer by the powerfull amp commaunding voice of christ which is of that force that neither the greatest rebell that euer was among man nor all the diuels in hell shal be able to withstand it and seeing that after the day of iudgement we must remaine for euer either in heauen or in hell we are to looke about us and to take heede unto our hearts indeed if the time vvere but a thousand or two thousand yeres then with more reason man might take libertie to themselues but seeing it is without end we must be most carefull through the whole course of our lives so to liue amp behaue our selues that when the day of iudgement shall come we may auoid that fearful sentece of euerlasting woe amp condenation which shalbe pronounced against the wicked and wheras all wicked man shall go to hell at christs commandement it teacheth us willingly to obey the voice of christ in the ministerie of the worde for if we rebell against his voice in this world vvhen in the day of iudgemet sentence shal be pronounced against us we shall heare another voice at the giuing whereof vve must obey whether vve will or no and thereupon go to euerlasting paine whither vve vvould not let us therfore in time denie our selues for our sinnes past and onely relie upon christ iesus for the free remission of them all and for the time to come leade a nevv reformed life thus much of the order of christ his proceeding at the day of iudgement novv follovv the uses thereof vvhich are either comforts to god church or duties for all me the first comforte or benefite is this that the same person vvhich died for us upon the crosse to work ou redemption must also be our udge and hence vve reape tvvo speciall comfortes i the people of god shall hereby inioy full redemption from all miseries and calamities which they had in this life so christ himselfe speaking of the signes of the end of the world saith to his disciples when you see th se things lift vp your heads for your redemptio draweth nere the he shall wipe all teares from their eies secondly we shall hereby haue a finall deliuerance from all sinne now what a ioyfull thing it is to be freed from sinne may plainely appeare by the cry of saint paul oh wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death and certen i is that he which knowes what sinne is and seriously repents him of the same would wish with all his heart to be ou of this world that he might leaue off to sinne and thereby to displease god the second comfort is this the godly in this worlde haue many enemy they are reuiled slaundred and oftentimes put to death well christ iesus at the day of iudgement will take euery mans case into his owne hand he will then heare the complaint of the godly howsoeuer in this world they found no remedie and then he will reuenge their blood that is shed vpon the earth according to their praier this comfort is to be considered especially of all those that are any way persecuted or molested by the wicked of this world now follow the duties to be learned of euery one of vs and they are diverse first the consideration of the last iudgement serueth to teach all ignorant persons and impenitent sinners repentance and humiliation for their sinnes and to mooue them with all speede to seeke vnto christ for the pardon of the same when paul preached to the athenians he willed them to repent vpon this ground amp reason because the lord hath appointed a day wherin he will iudge the world in righteousnes to speake plainly we can be content to heare the worde and to honour him with our lippes yet for the most part all is done but for fashions sake for still we liue in our old sinnes our hearts are not turned but in the feare of god let vs bethinke our selues of the time when we shall come before the iudge of heauen and earth and haue all our sinnes laide open and wee must answer for them all this is the point which the holy ghost vseth as a reason to mooue man vnto repentance and assuredly if this will not mooue vs there is nothing in the world will secondly to this purpose paul saith if we would iudge our selues we should not be iudged wouldest thou then escape the iudgement of christ at the last day then in this life iudge thy selfe now a man in iudging of himselfe must performe foure things i he must examine himselfe of his owne sinnes ii he must confesse them before the lord iii he must condemne himselfe and as a iudge vpon the bench giue sentence against himselfe lastly he must plead pardon and cry vnto god as for life and death for the remission of all his sinnes and he that doth this vnfainedly shall neuer be iudged of the lord at the last day but if we slacke and neglect this dutie in this life then vndoubtedly there remaines nothing but eternall woe in the world to come thirdly by this we may learne one not to iudge or condemne another as paul saith iudge nothing before the time vntill the lord come who lighten things that are hidde in darknes and make the counsells of the hearts manifest and christ saith iudgement is mine and iudge not and ye shall not be iudged and againe paul saith to the romanes why doest thou iudge thy brother for we must all appeare before the iudgement seat of christ but some will aske how doth one iudge another answer thus i when a man doth well to say of him that he doth euill ii when a man doth euill then to make it worse iii when a thing is doubtfull to take it in the worst part and by any of these three waies we are not to iudge either of mens persons or of their actions fourthly we must endeauour our selues to keepe a good conscience before god and before all man this is the practise of saint paul who in consideration and hope of a resurrection vnto iudgement as well of the iust as of the vniust endeauoured himselfe to haue alwaies a cleare conscience both towards god and towards man his example is worthie our marking and imitation for fewe there be that vpon this occasion make any conscience either of dutie to god or to their brother fifthly the last iudgement must stirre vs vp to a reuerend feare of god and cause vs to glorifie him as the angel saith in the revelation feare god and giue glorie to him for the houre of his iudgement is come and doubtles if any thing in the world will mooue a man to feare the lord it is this to remember the fearefull and terrible day of iudgement now hauing spoken hitherto of the first person the father and also of the son it followeth in the next place to speake of the third person in these words j beleeue in the holy ghost in which we may consider two things the title of the person and the action of faith repeated from the beginning the title is holy ghost or spirit it may here be demaunded how this title can be fit to expresse the third person which seemes to be common to the rest for the father is holy and the son is holy againe the father is a spirit and the son is a spirite answer indeede the father and the son are as well to be tearmed holy in respect of their natures as the third person for all three subsisting in one and the same godhead are consequently holy by one and the same holines but the third person is called holy because beside the holines of natures his office is to sanctifie the church of god nowe if it be said that sanctification is a worke of the whole trinitie the answeare is that although it be so yet the worke of sanctification agrees to the holy ghost in speciall maner the father sanctifieth by the sone and by the holy ghost the son sanctifieth from the father and by the holy ghost the holy ghost sanctifieth fro the father and from the son by himselfe immediatly and in this respect is the third person tearmed holy againe the third person is tearmed a spirit not only because his nature is spirituall for in that respect the father is a spirite and the son is a spirit but because he is spired or breathed fro the father and from the son in that he proceeds from the both thus we see there is speciall cause why the third person is called the holy ghost now the action of faith which concernes the third person is to beleeue in him which is i to acknowledge the h ghost as he hath reuealed himselfe in the word ii in speciall to beleeue that he is my sanctifier and comforter iii to put all the confidence of my heart in him for that cause in these words are comprised foure points of doctrine which are to be beleeued concerning the h ghost the first that he is very god for we are not to put our affiance or confidence in any but in god alone and no doubt the pennars of the creed in that they prefixed these words i beleeue in before the article of the third person meant thereby to signifie that he is true god equall with the father and the son according to the tenour of the scriptures themselues peter saith to ananias why hath satan filled thine heart that thou shouldest lie vnto the holy ghost and continuing the same speach he chaungeth the tearme onely and saith thou hast not lied vnto man but vnto god whereby he insinuateth that the holy ghost is very god in the vision of the prophet isai the wordes by him set down are thus i heard the voice of iehoua saying whome shall i send ampc and he said go and say to this people ye shall heare in deede but ye shall not vnderstand but paul quoting the same place spake on this maner well spake the h ghost by esay the prophet saying goe vnto this people and say vnto them now these places being compared together make it plaine that the title of iehovah agreeth to the holy ghost but yet the enemy of this truth which thinke that the holy ghost is nothing else but the action or operation of god obiect out of the scriptures to the contrarie i god knoweth the son the holy ghost knoweth not the son for none knoweth the son but the father ergo the holy ghost is not god answer that place excludeth no person in trinitie but onely creatures and false god and the meaning is this none that is no creature or idole god knoweth the son of god but the father and the opposition is made to exclude creatures not to exclude the holy ghost againe they obiect that the holy ghost maketh request for vs with groanes and sighes that cannot be vttered ergo the holy ghost is not god but rather a gift of god for he that is true god can not pray groane or sigh answer pauls meaning is thereby to signifie that the holy ghost causeth vs to make requests and stirreth vp our heartes to groane and sigh to god for he said before we haue receiued the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father yet further they obiect the wordes of the angel gabriel to the virgin marie saying the vertue of the most high hath ouershadowed thee and hence they gather that if the holy ghost be the vertue of god then he is not god indeede answer as christ is called the word of god not a word made of letters or syllables but a substantiall word that is beeing for euer of the same substance with the father so in this place the holy ghost is called the vertue of the most highest not because he is a created qualitie but because he is the substantiall vertue of the father amp the son amp therfore god equal with them both furthermore they alledge that neither the scriptures nor the practise of the primitiue church doth warrant vs to pray to the holy ghost ans it is not true for whensoeuer we direct our praier to any one of the three persons in him we pray to them all besides we haue example of praier made to the holy ghost in the word of god for paul saith to the corinthians the grace of our lord iesus the loue of god the father and the fellowship of the holy ghost be with you all and the words are as if paul had said thus o father let thy loue o son let thy grace o holy ghost let thy fellowship be with them all and therefore this first doctrine is true and as wel to be beleeued as any other that the holy ghost is god the second point is that the holy ghost is a distinct person from the father and the son hereupon the articles touching the three persos are thus distinguished i beleue in the father i beleeue in the son i beleeue in the h ghost this point also is consonant to the scriptures which make the same distinctio in the baptisme of christ the father vttereth a voice from heauen saying this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased amp not the son or the holy ghost secondly the son stoode in the water and was baptised by john and not the father or the holy ghost thirdly the holy ghost descended from heauen vpon christ in the forme of a doue and not the father or the son but the holy ghost alone christ in his commission vnto his disciples saith goe teach all nation baptizing them into the name of the father the son and the holy ghost now if the holy ghost had beene the same person either with the father or with the son then it had beene sufficient to haue named the father and the son onely and the distinction of the third person from the rest may be conceiued by this that the holy ghost is the holy ghost and not the father or the son the third point to be beleeued is that the holy ghost proceedeth from the father and the son for a further proofe hereof consider these places paul saith ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit for the spirit of god dwelleth in you but if any ma haue not the spirit of christ he is not his amp againe because ye are sonnes god hath sent forth the spirit of the son into your hearts where we may obserue that the holy ghost is the spirit both of the father and of the son now the holy ghost is called the spirit of the father not onely because he is sent of him but because hee proceedeth from the father as christ saith to his disciples when the comforter will come whome i shall send vnto you from the father euen the spirit of truth which proceedeth of the father he shall testifie of mee and therefore likewise he is the spirit of the son not onely because he is sent of the son but also because he proceedeth from him againe in the trinitie the person sending doth communicate his whole essence and substance to the person sent as the father sending the son doth communicate his essence and substance to the son for sending doth presuppose a communication of essence now the father and the son send the holy ghost therefore both of them communicate their substance and essence vnto the same person thirdly christ saith the holy ghost hath receiued of mine which he shall shew vnto you namely knowledge and truth to be reuealed vnto his church whece we may reason thus the person receiuing knowledge from an other receiues essence also the h ghost receiueth truth amp knowledge from christ to be reuealed vnto the church amp therfore first of all he hath receiued substance and essence from the son but some peraduenture will say where is it written in all the bible in expresse words that the holy ghost proceeds fro the sone as he proceeds fro the father ans the scripture saith not so much in plaine tearmes yet we must know that that which is gathered forth of the by iust cosequet is no lesse the truth of god then that which is expressed in words hereupon all churches saue those in greece with one consent acknowledge the truth of this point the fourth and last point is that the holy ghost is equal to the father amp the sone and this we are taught to acknowledge in the creede in that we doe as well beleeue in the holy ghost as in the father and the son and though the holy ghost be sent of the father amp the son yet as i haue said before that argues no inequalitie for one equal may send an other by consent but order onely wherby the holy ghost is last of all the three persons againe in that the h ghost receiueth from the son it prooues no inferioritie because he receiues from the son whatsoeuer he receiues by nature and not by grace and he receiues not a part but all that the son hath sauing the proprietie of his person now follow the benefits which are giuen by th h ghost amp they are of sorts some are como to all creatures amp some are proper to man the benefit of the h ghost common to all creatures is the worke of creation amp preseruation for all things were created amp made amp afterward preserued by the h ghost so elihu saith the spirit of god hath made me and moses saith in the beginning the spirit mooued vpon the water the phrase is borrowed from a bird who in hatching of her young ones sits vpon the egges mooues her selfe vpon them and heates them and so likewise the holy ghost in the beginning did by his owne power cherish and preserue the masse or lumpe whereof all things were made and caused it to bring foorth the creatures this beeing euident that the holy ghost hath a stroake in the worke of creation and preseruation we must vnfainedly acknowledge that we were first created and since that time continually preserued by the benefit euen of the third person the benefits proper vnto man are of two sorts some are common to all man both good and badde and some proper to the elect and faithfull the benefits common to all man are diverse i the gift of practising a particular calling as in the bodie seuerall members haue seuerall vses so in euery societie seuerall man haue seuerall offices and callings and the gifts whereby they are inabled to performe the duties thereof are from the holy ghost when gedeon became a valiant captaine to deliuer the israelites it is said he was cloathed with the spirit bezaleel and aholiab beeing set apart to build the tabernacle were filled with the spirit of god in wisedome and in vnderstanding and in all workemanship to finde out curious workes to worke in gold and in siluer and in brasse also in the article to set stones and to carue in timber ampc by this it is manifest that the skill of any handicraft is not in the power of man but comes by the holy ghost and by this we are taught to vse all those gifts well wherby we are inabled to discharge our particular callings that they may serue for the glorie of god and the good of his church and those that in their callings vse fraud and deceit or else liue inordinately doe most vnthankfully abuse the gifts of the holy ghost which one day they must answeare for the second gift common to all is illumination whereby a man is inabled to vnderstand the will of god in his word the iewes in the reading of the old testament had a vaile ouer their hearts and the like haue all man by nature to whome the word of god is foolishnes paul at his conuersion was smitten blinde and skales were vpon his eyes the like also be ouer the eies of our mindes and they must fall away before we can vnderstand the will of god now it is the worke of the holy ghost to remooue these skales and filmes from our eies and for this very cause hee is called the annointing and eyesalue for as it doth cleare the eyes and take away dimnesse from them so doth the holy ghost take away blindnes from our mindes that we may see into the truth of god word this beeing a common gift and receiued both of good and badde it standeth vs in hand not to content our selues with the bare knowledge of the word but therewithall we must ioyne obedience and make conscience thereof or else that will befall vs which christ foretold that he which knoweth his masters will and doth it not shall be beaten with many stripes the third gift of the holy ghost is the gift of prophecie whereby a man is made able to interpret and expound the scriptures now albeit this gift be very excellent and not giuen to euery man yet is it common both to good and badde for in the day of iudgement when man shall come to christ and say master we haue prophecied in thy name he shall answer again i neuer knew you depart from me ye workers of iniquitie hereupon those that are in the calling of the ministerie and haue receiued the gift of prophecie must not herewithall be puffed vp for if they be not as wel doers of god will as teachers their gifts wil turne to their further condemnation as the carpenters that built noahs arke when the floode came were drowned because they would not obey noahs preaching so those that haue the gifts of prophecie and are builders in god house if they build not themselues as well as others for all their preaching at the day of iudgement they shal be condemned and therefore it standeth them in hande not to content themselues with this that they know and teach others god wil but they themselues must be the first doers of the same the fourth common gift of the holy ghost is abilitie to bridle and restraine some affections so as they shall not breake out into outragious behauiour haman a wicked man amp an enemie to god church when he saw mordecai the iew sitting in the kings gate amp that he would not stand vp nor moue for him he was full of indignatio neuertheles the text saith that he refrained himselfe and when abimelech an heathen king had taken sara abrahams wife god said vnto him i know that thou diddest this with an vpright heart and the text addeth further i haue kept thee that thou shouldest not sinne against me and thus the lord giueth to man as yet without the spirit of sanctification this gift to bridle them selues so as in outward action they shall not practise this or that sinne for why did not abimelech commit adulterie surely because god kept him from it againe in the history of the heathen we may read of many that were iust liberall meeke continent ampc and that by a generall operation of the holy ghost that represseth the corruption of nature for the common good here then if any man aske how it commeth to passe that some man are more modest and ciuill then others seeing all man by nature are equally wicked the answeare may be not as the common saying is because some are of better nature then others for all the sonnes of adam are equall in regard of nature the childe new borne in that respect is as wicked as the eldest man that euer liued but the reason is because god giueth this common gift of restraining the affections more to some then to others this must be considered of vs all for a man may haue the spirit of god to bridle many sinnes and yet neuer haue the spirit to mortifie the same and to make him a new creature and this beeing so we must take heede that we deceiue not our selues for it is not sufficient for a man to liue in outward ciuilitie amp to keepe in some of his affections vpon some occasion for that a wicked man may doe but we must further labour to feele in our selues the spirit of god not onely bridling sinne in vs but al o mortifying and killing the same in deede both of them are the good gifts of god spirit but yet the mortification of sinne is the chiefest beeing an effectuall signe of grace and proper to the elect the fifth grace and gift of the holy ghost is to heare and receiue the word of god with ioy in the parable of the sower one kinde of badde grounde are they which when they haue heard receiue the word with ioy and this is that which the author of the hebrues calls the tasting of the good vvord of god and of the povvers of the vvorld to come we knowe that there is great difference betweene tasting of meate and eating of it they that sit downe at the table doe both tast and eate but they that dresse the meate doe onely see and tast thereof so it is at the lord table many there be that haue this gift truly both to tast and eate of the bodie and bloode of christ offered in the word and sacraments and some againe doe onely tast and feele the sweetenesse of them and reioyce therein but yet are not indeede partakers thereof now if this be so then all those which heare the worde of god must take heede how they heare and labour to finde these two things in themselues by hearing i that in heart and conscience they be thoroughly touched and humbled for their sinnes ii that they be certely assured of the fauour and loue of god in christ and that the sweete promises of the gospell doe belong to them and in consideration hereof they must make conscience of all sinne both in thought word amp deede through the whole course of their liues and this kinde of hearing bringeth that ioy which vanisheth not away thus much of the benefits of the holy ghost common to all man both good and bad now follow such as are proper to the elect all which may be reduced vnto one namely the inhabitation of the spirit whereby the elect are the temples of the h ghost who is said to dwell in man not in respect of substance for the whole nature of the h ghost cannot be comprised in the bodie or soule of man but in respect of a particular operation and this dwelling stands in two things the first that the holy ghost doth abide in them not for a time onely but for euer for the worde dwelling noteth perpetuitie secondly that the holy ghost hath the full disposition of the heart as when a man commeth to dwell in an house whereof he is lord he hath libertie to gouerne it after his owne will now this disposition of the hearts of the faithfull by the holy ghost standeth in fiue speciall amp notable gifts euery one worth our obseruation the first is a certen knowledge of a mans owne reconciliation to god in christ as it is said in isai by his knowledge my righteous servant shall iustifie many and christ saith this is life eternall that they knowe thee to be the onely very god and vvhome thou hast sent jesus christ this knowledge is not generall for then the devil might be saued but it is particular whereby a man knoweth god the father to be his father and christ the redeemer to be his redeemer and the holy ghost to be his sanctifier and comforter and it is fro the speciall worke of the h ghost as paul saith the spirit of god beareth witnes to our spirits that we are the children of god and we haue receiued the spirit which is of god that we might knowe the things that are giuen vnto vs of god the second gift is regeneration whereby a man of a limme of the deuill is made a member of christ and of a child of satan whome euery one of vs by nature do as liuely resemble as any man doth his owne parent is made the child of god except a man saith our sauiour christ be born againe by water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen john baptist in saying that christ baptized with the h ghost and fire compares the spirit of god to fire and water to fire for two causes i as it is the nature of fire to warme the bodie that is benummed and frozen with cold so when a man is benummed and frozen in sinne yes when he is euen stark dead in sinne it is the propertie of the holy ghost to warme and quicken his heart and to reuiue him ii fire doth purge and eate out the drosse from the good mettall now there is no drosse nor canker that hath so deepely eaten into any mettall as sinne into the nature of man and therefore the holy ghost is as fire to purge and eate out the hidden corruptions of sinne out of the rebellious heart of man againe the holy ghost is compared to cleare water for two causes i man by nature is as drie wood without sappe and the propertie of the holy ghost is as water to supple and to put sappe of grace into the dead and rotten heart of man ii the propertie of water is to clense and purifie the filth of the bodie euen so the holy ghost doth spiritually wash away our sinnes which are the filth of our nature and this is the second benefite of the h ghost by this we are taught that he which would enter into the kingdo of god amp haue the h ghost to dwell in him must labour to feele the worke of regeneration by the same holy spirit and if a man would know whether he haue this worke wrought in him or no let him marke what s paul saith they that are of the spirit sauour the things that are of the spirit but they that liue after the flesh sauour the things of the flesh if therefore a man haue his heart continually affected with that which is truly good either more or lesse it is a certen token that his wicked nature is changed and he regenerate but contrariwise if his heart be alwaies set on the pleasures of sinne and the things of this world he may iustly suspect himselfe that he is not regenerated as for example if a man haue all his minde set vpon drink amp gulling in of wine and strong drink hauing litle delight nor pleasure in any thing els it argues a carnal mind and vngerenerate because it affects the things of the flesh amp so of the rest and on the cotrary he that hath his minde affected with a desire to do the wil of god in practising the works of charitie amp religion he i say hath a spirituall and a renewed heart and is regenerate by the holy ghost the third worke of the holy ghost is to gouerne the hearts of the elect this may be called spirituall regiment a man that dwelleth in a house of his owne orders amp gouerns it according to his owne will euen so the holy ghost gouerns all the in who he dwelleth as paul saith they that are the sonnes of god are ledde by his spirit a most notable benefit for looke where the holy ghost dwelleth there he wil be lord gouerning both heart minde will and affections and that two waies i by repressing all badde motions vnto sinne arising either from the corruption of mans nature from the world or from the deuill ii by stirring vp good affections and motions vpon euery occasion so it is saide the flesh that is the corruption of mans nature lusteth against the spirit and the spirit that is grace in the heart lusteth against the flesh and that after a double sort first by labouring to ouermaster and keepe downe the motions thereof secondly by stirring vp good motions and inclinations to pietie and religion in esay the holy ghost hath most excellent titles the spirit of the lord the spirit of wisdome and vnderstanding the spirit of counsell and of strength the spirit of knowledge and of the feare of the lord now he is so called because he stirreth vp good motions in the godly of wisedome of knowledge of strength of vnderstanding of counsell and of the feare of the lord and saint paul saith that the fruits of the spirit are ioy peace loue long suffering gentlenes goodnes faith meekenes temperance ampc all which are so tearmed because where the h ghost ruleth there he ingendreth these good gifts and motions of grace but among all the inward motions of the spirit the most principall are these i an vtter disliking of sinne because it is sinne and that is when a man hath an eye not so much to another mans sinnes as to his owne and seeing them is truly sorowfull for them and disliketh them and himselfe for them not so much because there is a place of torment or a day of iudgement to come wherin he must answer to god for them all but as if there were no hell or iudgement because god is displeased by them who hath beene vnto him a most louing and merciful father in redeeming him by christ the second is an hungring desire aboue all things in this world to be at vnitie with god in christ for the same sinnes this is a motion of the h ghost which no man can haue but he in whom the h ghost doth dwell the third the gift of heartie praier for this cause the h ghost is called the spirit of supplications because it stirreth vp the heart amp makes it fit to pray amp therefore paul saith that the spirit of god helpeth our infirmities for we knowe not what to pray as we ought but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes which cannot be expressed this is an ordinarie worke of the holy ghost in all that beleeue and he that would know whether he haue the spirit dwelling truly in his heart shall know it by this a mother carrieth hir child in hir armes if it crie for the dugge and suckes the same it is aliue being obserued many daies together if it neither crie nor stirre it is dead in like manner it is an vnfallible note of a true child of god to cry to his father in heauen by praier but he that neuer crieth nor feeleth himselfe stirred vp to make his mone to god is in a miserable case and he may well be thought to be but a dead childe and therefore let vs learne in praier vnfainedly to powre out our soules before god considering it is a speciall gift of the holy ghost bestowed on the children of god the fourth worke of the holy ghost in the heart of the elect is comfort in distresse and therefore our sauiour christ calleth him the comforter whome he w ll sende and in the psalme he is called the oyle of gladnes because he maketh glad the heart of man in trouble and distresse there be two things that fill the heart full of endlesse griefe i outward calamities as when a man is in any daunger of death when he looseth his goods his good name his friends and such like the second thing is a troubled conscience whereof salomon saith a troubled spirit who can beare it and of all other it is the most heauie and grieuous crosse that can be when as the hand of god was heauie vpon iob this was the soarest of all his affliction and therefore he crieth out that the arrowes of the almightie did sticke in his soule now what is the comfort in this case answer in the middest of all our distresses the holy ghost is present with vs to make vs reioyce and to fill vs with comforts that no tongue can expresse and hereupon the vngodly man when afflictions befal him is readie to make away himselfe because he wanteth the comfort of the holy ghost the last benefit wrought in the hearts of the elect is the strengthening of them to doe the weightiest duties of their callings and hence the holy ghost is called the spirit of strength there be diverse things to be done of a christian man that are farre beyond the reach of his power as first when he seeth his owne sinnes and is truly humbled for them then to lift vp the hand of faith to heauen and thereby to catch hold on the mercie of god in christ is the hardest thing in the whole world and this doe all those know to be true in some part which know what it is to beleeue secondly it is as hard a thing in the time of temptation to resist temptation as for drie wood to resist the fire when it begins to burne thirdly when a man is put to his choice either to loose his life goods friends and all that he hath or else to forsake religion euen then to forsake all and to sticke vnto christ is a matter of as great difficultie as any of the former fourthly when a man wanteth the ordinarie meanes of god providence as meat drinke and cloathing then at the very same instant to acknowledge god prouidence to reioyce in it and to relie thereon is as much as if a man should shake the whole earth it is against our wicked nature to trust god vnlesse he first lay down some pawne of his loue and mercie towards vs how then will some say shall any one be able to doe these things answer the holy ghost is the spirit of strength and by him we doe al things as paul saith j am able to doe all things through the helpe of christ which strengtheneth me concerning these gifts of the holy ghost two questions may be mooued first what is the measure of grace in this life answer small in respect in this world we receiue as paul saith but the first fruits of god spirit and the earnest of the spirit nowe the first fruits properly are but as an handfull or twaine of corne to a whole corne field containing many acres and furlongs of ground and the earnest in a bargaine it may be is but a pennie laid downe for the paying of twentie thousand pound the second question is whether the graces of the h ghost may be wholly lost or not answer the common gifts of the spirit may be lost and extinquished but the gifts proper to the elect can not indeede they may be diminished and couered as coales vnder ashes and as the sappe in the roote of the tree in the winter season not appearing at all in the braunches and the feeling of them may be lost but they cannot either finally or totally be abolished it is true that god doth forsake his children but that is only in part as he left ezechias to prooue amp try what was in his heart a mother that loues her child most tenderly sets it downe in the flore lets it stand amp fall amp break the face and all this while shee hides her selfe not because her purpose is to leaue her childe quite or to make it hurt it selfe but that when shee taketh it up againe it may loue her the better so dealeth the holy ghost with man to make them see their own weakenesse amp frailtie he hides himselfe as it were in some corner of the heart for a season that they may the more earnestly hunger after grace the want whereof they felte the use of this article whereby we confesse that we beleeue in the holy ghost is manifold first considering that all the giftes which any man hath whether they be giftes of knowledge in the worde of god or of humane learning or againe giftes whereby man are inabled to practise their trade or handicraftes doe come not from our selues but from the holy ghost we are taught this dutie looke what giftes soeuer we for our partes haue receiued of the spirit of god we must use them so as they may euer serue for the glorie of god and good of our brother and not to the practising amp setting forth of any maner of sinne and by consequent to the seruice of the deuill for that is as if a man receiuing riches and reuenues of his prince should straight way go to the princes enemie amp employ them for his benefite which were a point of exceeding trecherie furthermore in euery place the greater part of man are blind and ignorant persons both young and olde and aged folkes as they are ignorant themselues so they nuzzle up their youth in ignorance conferre with them you shall find that they can say nothing but that which may be learned by common talke as that there is a god and that this god must bee worshipped but aske them further of the meanes of their saluation and of their duties to god and man and they will answere you that they are not booke learned tell them further that the ordinarie means to bring man to knowledge is the preaching of the word which if they will not use they shalbe inexcusable they will say alas we are dull of memorie and can not learne well for all this thou saiest thou beleeuest in the holy ghost and hee is thy schoole master to teach thee though thy capacitie be dull yet he is able to open thine understading for as there is outwarde teaching by the minister so the worke of the holy ghost is ioyned withall to enlighten the conceit of the minde that they which heare the worde with reuerence may profite thereby and get knowledge but if for all this man will not learne but remaine ignorant still then let them marke the example of the sonnes of eli he in some part did rebuke them for their wickednesse but yet they woulde not obey and the reason is there set downe because the lorde would destroy them in the same manner howsoeuer we may not iudge of any mans person yet this may be said that if man refuse to heare the worde of god when they may or if in hearing they will not obey it is a fearefull signe that god will at length destroy them when a trumpet is sounded in a mans eare and hee lyes still not stirring at all hee is certenly deade and surely when the trumpet of the gospell is sounded in the eares of our hearts if we awake not out of our sinnes to newnesse of life wee are no better then deade man before god wherefore the case beeing thus dangerous and the punishment so great let us labour in time for the knowledge of god will and preuent god iudgements before they light upon us thirdly as the apostle saith if we live in the spirite vvee must walke in the spirit that is if we be dead unto sinne by the power of the holy ghost and be raised up to newnesse of life then we must walke in the spirite now to walke in the spirite is to leade our liues in shewing forth the fruites of the spirite in esai the holy ghost is compared unto water powred foorth on the drie land which maketh the willowes to blossome and to beare fruite wherefore those that haue the giftes of the spirit must be trees of righteousnes bringing forth the fruits of the spirit which as they are set downe by paul are principally nine the first fruit is love which respects both god and man loue unto god is an inwarde and spirituall motion in the heart whereby god is loued absolutely for himselfe this loue shewes it selfe in two things i when a mans heart is set and disposed to seeke the honour and glorie of god in all thinges ii when a man by all meanes strives and endeauours himselfe to please god in euery thing counting it a most miserable estate to liue in the displeasure of god and the hearte that is thus affected can haue no greater torment then to fall into sinne whereby god is offended and his displeasure prouoked by these two signes a man may know whether he loue god or no and by them also must hee testifie his loue now our loue to man is a fruite of this loue of god for god is to be loued for himselfe man is loued for god this loue must not be in shew onely but in deede and action saint john biddeth us not to loue in worde and tongue onely but in deed and trueth brotherly loue doth not alwaies lie hid but when an occasion is offered it doeth breake forth into action it is like fire which though for a time it be smothered yet at length it breakes forth into a flame and so much loue a man sheweth to his neighbour as he hath and where none is shewed none is the second fruite is ioy when a man is as glad at the good of his neighbor as at his own good amp this is a speciall worke of the holy ghost for the nature of man is to pine away and to grieue at the good of another and it is a worke of grace to reioyce thereat paul saieth reioyce vvith them that reioyce and this was the holy practise of the friendes and neighbours of zacharias and elizabeth when john baptist was borne they came and reioyced with them the third fruit of the spirit is peace of this paul speaketh most excellently saying if it be possible as much as in you is have peace with all man it is nothing else but cocord which must be kept in an holy manner with all man both good amp bad so farre forth as can be isai the prophet speaking of the fruits of the gospell saieth the woolfe shall dwell with the lamb amp the leopard with the kid ampc where note that in the kingdome of christ when a man is called into the state of grace howsoeuer by nature he be as a wolfe as a leopard as a lyon or as a beare yet he shal then lay away his cruell nature and become gentle and liue peaceably with all man now for the practising of this peace there are three duties especially to be learned amp perfourmed i rather then peace shoulde be broken a man must yeeld of his owne right when publicanes came to our sauiour christ for tribute he had a lawful excuse for howsoeuer he liued in lowe estate among them yet hee was the right heire to the kingdome amp therefore was free neuerthelesse he stood not on his priuiledge but calleth peter saying least wee offend them goe to the sea and cast in an angle and take the first fish that c mmeth up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt finde a peece of twentie pence take it and give it to them for thee and me here we see that our sauiour christ rather then he woulde breake the common peace yeeldes of his owne right and so we must doe if we will be good followers of him secondly when any man shall sinne either in worde or in deed specially if it be upon infirmitie wee must auoide bitter invectiues and mildely tell him of his fault and in all meekenesse and loue labour for his amendment so paul teacheth us saying if any man be fallen into any fault by occasion restore such an one with the spirite of meekenesse considering thy selfe least thou be also tempted ampc beare yee one anothers burden thirdly euery man within the compasse of his calling must be a peace maker betweene them that are at variance this is a speciall duty of godlines and christianitie and therefore our sauiour christ doeth highly commend such and pronounceth this blessing upon them that they shall be called the children of god the fourth fruite of the spirit is long suffering and it standeth in two pointes i when a man deferreth his anger and is hardly brought to it ii being angrie doth yet moderate the same and stay the hotnesse of that affection for the first to bridle anger it is a speciall work of the h ghost and the meanes to attaine vnto it are these i not to take notice of the iniuries and wrongs done unto us if they be not of great moment but to let them passe as not knowing them salomon saith it is a mans discretion to deferre his anger now how is that done it is added in the next words it is the glory of a man to passe by infirmitie that is when a man shall ouershoote himselfe either in word or in deede to let it passe either wholly or till a time convenient as though we knew not of it the second way to deferre and bridle anger is when a man hath iniuried us either in word or deede to thinke with our selues that wee haue iniured others in the same maner and for this cause salomon saith give not thine heart to all the vvordes that man speake least thou doe heare thy servant cursing thee for oftentimes thine heart also knoweth that thou hast cursed others a man must not listen to euerie mans wordes at all times but hee is to thinke that he hath spoken or done the same to other man and that now the lord meeteth with him by the like as it is saide with what measure yee meete it shalbe measured to you againe this is a thing which few consider euill man desire good reporte and woulde haue all man speake well of them whereas they can speake well of none but indeede they must begin to speake well of others before others shall speake well of them thirdly a man must consider how god dealeth with him for so often as he sinneth hee prouoketh god to cast him away and to confound him eternally yet the lorde is mercifull and long suffering euen so when man doe offend and iniury us wee must doe as god doth not be angry but fight against our affections endeauouring to become patient amp long suffering as god is with us the second propertie of long suffering is to keepe the affection of anger in moderation and compasse it is not alwaies a sinne to be angry and therefore it is said of christ in whome was no blemish of sinne that he was angry yet wee must looke that our anger be moderate and not overlong as paul saith let not the son goe dovvne vpon your wrath the fift fruite of the spirite is gentlenesse whereby a man behaueth and sheweth himselfe friendly and courteous to euerie man as paul saith to titus put them in remembrace that they speake evill of no man that they be no fighters but soft shevving all meekenesse unto all man vvhether they be good or badde this gentlenesse standeth in these pointes first to speake to euerie man friendly and louingly ii to salute friendly and courteously iii to be readie upon euery occasion to giue reuerence and honour to euery man in his place it is made a question of some whether a man is to salute amp speak unto them that are knowen to be lewd amp wicked man but here we see what our dutie is in that we are taught to be curteous to all man both good and badde yet so as wee approoue not of their sinnes as for that which s john saith of false prophets receive them not neither bid them god speed it is to be understood of giuing an outward approbation to false teachers the sixt fruit is goodnesse which is when a man is ready to doe good and become seruiceable in his calling to all man at all times upon all occasions this was to be seene in that holy man iob he saith that hee was eyes to the blind and feete to the lame a father unto the poore and when he kn w not the cause he sought it out and s paul shewed this fruite most notably after his conuersion for he saith that hee vvas made all things to all man that he might save some hee was content to undergoe any thing for the good of any man and as we haue heard the godly are trees of righteousnes bearing fruit not for themselues but for others and therfore paul in the epistle to the galatians giueth this rule do service one to another in love in these daies it is harde to finde these duties perfourmed in any place for both practise and proverbe is commonly this every man for himselfe and god for us all but it is a gracelesse saying and the contrary must be practised of all that desire to be guided by the spirit the seuenth fruite is faith faith or fidelitie standeth in these two duties one to make conscience of a lie and to speake everie thing whereof we speake as we thinke it is and not to speake one thing and thinke another a rare thing it is to find this vertue in the world now a daies who is he that maketh conscience of a lie and is not truth banished out of our coastes considering that for gaines and outward commodity man make no bones of glosing and dissembling but alas the practise is damnable amp the contrarie is the fruite of the holy ghost namely to speake the truth from the heart and he that can doe this by the estimonie of god himselfe shall rest in the mountaine of his holinesse euen in the kingdome of heauen the second point wherin fidelitie consisteth is when a man hath made a promise that is lawful and good to keepe and performe the same some thinke it is a small matter to breake promise but indeed it is a fruite of the flesh and contra wise a fruite of the spirite to perfourme a lawful promise and a mans word should be as sure as an obligation and in conscience a man is bounde to keepe promise so farre foorth as hee vvill to whom the promise is made indeed if a man be released of his promise he is then free othervvise if wee promise and doe not perfourme we doe not onely cracke our credit before man but also sinne before god the eighth fruite of the spirit is meekenesse which is a notable grace of god when a man prouoked by iniuries doth neither intend nor enterprise the requitall of the same and it standes in three duties the first is to interprete the sayings and doings of other man in better part as much as possibly may be the second when man mistake and misconstrue our sayings and doings if the matter be of smaller moment to be silent and patient as christ was when hee was accused before the high priestes and pharisies this being withall remembred that if the matter be of weight and moment vve may defend our selues by soft and milde answeres the thirde is not to contend in word or deede vvith any man but vvhen vvee are to deale vvith others to speake our mind and so an end the last fruite of the spirit is temperance whereby a man bridleth his appetite or lust in meate drinke and apparell in bridling the lust these rules must be observed i eating and drink must be ioyned vvith continuall fasting after this manner wee must not glutt our selues but rather abstaine from that vvhich nature desireth and as some use to speake leaue our stomackes craving ii a man must so eate and drinke as aftervvarde he may the better be inabled for god worship creatures are abused vvhen they make us unfitte to serue god the commo fault is on the sabbath day man so pamper themselues as that they are made unfitte both to heare and learne god vvorde and fitte for nothing but to slumber and sleepe but following this rule of temperance these faultes shall be amended iii this must be a caueat in our apparell that we be attired according to our callings in holy comelinesse the lorde hath threatned to visite all those that are cloathed in straunge apparell and holy comelinesse is this when the apparell is both for fashion and matter so made and worne that it may expresse and shew forth the graces of god in the heart as sobrietie temperaunce grauitie ampc and the beholder may take occasion by the apparell to acknowledge and commend these vertues but lamentable is the time looke on man and woman in these daies and you may see and reade their sinnes written in great letters on their apparell as intemperance pride and wantonnesse euerie day new fashions please the world but indeede that holy comelinesse which the holy ghost doeth commend to us is the right fashion when all is done and these are the nine fruites of the spirit which wee must put in practise in our liues and conuersations fourthly if we beleeue in the holy ghost and thereupon doe persuade our selues that hee will dwell in us wee must daily labour as wee are commaunded to keepe our vess ls in holinesse and honour unto the lorde and the reason is good if a man be to entertaine but an earthly prince or some man of state he would be sure to haue his house in a readinesse amp all matters in order against his comming so as euery thing might be pleasing unto so worthy a guest well now behold wee put our confidence and affiance in the holy ghost and doe beleeue that he will come unto us and sanctifie us and lodge in our hearts he is higher then all states in the world whatsoeuer and therefore we must looke that our body and soules be kept in an honourable and holy manner so as they may be fitte temples for him to dwell in s paul biddeth us not to grieve the holy spirite where the holy ghost is compared to a guest amp our body and soules unto innes and as man use their guestes friendly and courteously shewing unto them all seruice and dutie so must wee doe to god spirite which is come to dwell and abide in us doing nothing in any case which may disquiet or molest him now there is nothing so grieuous unto him as our sinnes and therefore we must make conscience of all manner of sinne least by abusing of our selues we do cause the holy ghost as it were with griefe to depart fro us when the arke of the couenant which was a signe of the presence of god was in the house of obed edom the text saieth that the lord blessed him and all his house but wh n the holy ghost dwelles in a mans heart there is more then the arke of the lorde present euen god him selfe and therefore may we looke for a greater blessing now then shall we grieue the holy goost by sinning seeing we reape such benefite by his abode it is saide that our sauiour christ was angrie when hee came into the temple at ierusalem and saw the abuses therein now shall hee be angrie for the abuses that are done in a temple of stone and seeing the temples of our body which are not made of stone but are spirituall figured by that earthly temple seeing them i say abused by sinne will he not be much more angry yes we may assure our selues he can not abide that and therefore if wee beleeue in the holy ghost wee must hereupon be mooued to keepe our body and soules pure amp cleane and further to perswade us hereunto we must remember this that when we pollute our soules and body with any manner of sinne wee make them euen stables and styes for our wretched enemie the deuill to harbour in for when sathan is once cast out if afterward wee fall againe to our olde sinnes and loosenesse of life and so defile our body they are then most cleane and neate for him to dwell in whereupon he wil come and bring seuen other devil worse then himselfe and so a mans last ende shall be worse then his beginning now what a fearefull thing is this that the body which should be a temple for the holy ghost by our sinnes should be made a stable for the devill further s paul biddeth us not to quench the spirit the graces of the holy spirite in this life are like sparks of fire which may soone be quenched with a little water now so oft as we sinne we cast water upon the grace of god and as much as wee can put out the same therefore it standes us in hand to make conscience of euery thing wherein wee may offende and displease god and wee may assure our selues that so long as wee liue and lie in our corruptions and sinnes the holy ghost will neuer come and dwell with us hee is a pure spirite and therefore must haue an undefiled temple to dwell in thus we haue heard what is to be beleeued concerning the father son amp holy ghost now looke as we beleeue in god distinguished into persons so we must remember that when wee perfourme diuine worshippe to him we may distinguish the persons but wee are not to seuer them when wee pray to the father wee must not omit the son or the holy ghost but make our praiers to them all for as in nature they are one and in person not deuided but distinguished so in all worshippe wee must neuer confounde or seuer the persons but distinguish them and worship the trinitie in unitie and untie in trinitie one god in three persons and three persons in one god hitherto we haue intreated of the first part of the creed concerning god now followeth the second part thereof concerning the church and it was added to the former upon speciall consideration for august in enchir c the right order of a confession did require that after the trinitie the church should be mentioned as the house after the owner the temple after god and the citie after the builder againe the creed is concluded with pointes of doctrine concerning the church because whosoeuer is out of it is also forth of the number of god children idem lib cap de symb ad catech and he cannot haue god for his father which hath not the church for his mother question is made what the wordes are which are to be supplied in this article the holy catholike church whether i beleeve or i beleeve in and ancient expositours haue sufficiently determined the matter one ruffin in symb saieth in these vvordes in which is set forth our faith of the godhead it is said in god the father in the son and in the holy ghost but in the rest where the speech is not of the godhead but of creatures and mysteries the preposition in is not added that it should be in the holy church but that we should beleeve there is an an holy church not as god but as a company gathered to god and man should beleeve that there is remission of sinnes not in the remission of sinnes and they shoulde beleeve the resurrection of the body not in the resurrection of the body therefore by this preposition the creatour is distinguished from the creatures and thinges pertaining to god from things pertaining to man another upon these wordes this is the worke of god that yee beleeue in him saith if yee beleeve in him ye beleeve him not if yee beleeve him yee beleeve in him for the devil beleeved god but did not beleeue in him againe of the apostles we may say we beleeve paul but vvee doe not beleeve in paul wee beleeve peter but wee beleeve not in peter for his faith that beleeveth in him which iustifieth the ungodly is imputed to him for righteousnesse what is it therefore to beleeve in him by beleeving to love and like and as it vvere to passe into him and to be incorporated into his members novv the reasons which some papistes bring to the contrarie to prooue that wee may beleeue in the creatures and in the church are of no moment first they alledge the phrase of scripture exod they beleeved in god and in moses sam and achis beleeved in david chronicle beleeve in the prophets and prosper answer the hebrewe phrase in which the servile letter beth is used must not be translated with a preposition that ruleth an accuseth or ablatiue case but with a datiue case on this manner beleeve moses david the prophets and it doeth not import any affiance in the creature but onely a giuing of credence by one man to another secondly they alleadge that ancient fathers reade the article on this manner i beleeve in the holy catholike church ansvver indeed some haue done so but by this kinde of speech they signified no more but thus much that they beleeued that there was a catholike church thus hauing found what words are to be supplyed let us come to the meaning of the article and that wee may proceede in order let us first of all see vvhat the church is the church is a peculiar company of man predestinate to life everlasting and made one in christ first i say it is a peculiar company of man for saint peter saieth yee are a chosen generation a royall priesthood an holy nation and a peculiar people he speakes indeede of the church of god on earth but his saying may be also extended to the whole church of god as well in heauen as in earth now because there can be no company vnlesse it haue a beginning amp a cause whereby it is gathered therefore i adde further in the definition predestinate to life everlasting noting thereby the ground and cause of the catholike church namely god e ernall predestination to life euerlasting and to this purpose our sauiour christ saieth feare not little flocke for it is your fathers will to give you the kingdome signifying thereby that the first and principall cause of the church is the good pleasure of god whereby hee hath before all workes purposed to aduance his elect to eternal saluatio therfore one saith well bernard in cant only the elect are the church of god and further because no company can continue and abide for euer vnlesse the members thereof be ioyned and coupled togither by some bonde therefore i adde in the last place made one vvith christ this union maketh the church to be the church and by it the members thereof whether they be in heauen or in earth are distinguished from all other company whatsoeuer now this coniunction betwene christ and the church is auouched by saint paul when hee saieth christ is the heade to his bodie vvhich is his church and vvhen he ascribes the name of christ not onely to the person of the son but to the church it selfe as in the epistle to the galatians to abraham and his seede vvere the promises made hee saieth not and to his seedes as speaking of many but and vnto his seed as speaking of one vvhich is christ that is not the redeemer alone but also the church redeemed for christ as hee is man is not the onely seede of abraham and this definition of the church is almost in so many words set downe in the scriptures in that it is called the family of god partly in heauen and partly in earth named of christ and it is also called the heavenly ierusalem the mother of vs all and the celestiall ierusalem and the congregation of the first borne nowe for the better understanding of the nature estate and partes of the church two pointes among the rest must be considered the efficient cause thereof god predestination and the forme the mysticall vnion in handling the doctrine of predestination my meaning is onely to stande on such pointes as are reuealed in the worde and necessarie tending to edification and first i will shewe what is the trueth and secondly the contrarie falshood in the trueth i consider foure things i what predestination is ii what is the order of it iii what be the partes of it iiii what is the use predestination may thus be defined it is a parte of the counsell of god whereby hee hath before all times purposed in him selfe to shevve mercie on some man and to passe by others shevving his iustice on them for the manifestation of the glorie of his ovvne name first i say it is a parte of his counsell because the counsell or decree of god universally extends it selfe to all things that are and predestination is god decree so farre foorth as it concernes the reasonable creatures especially man now in euery purpose or decree of god three things must be considered the beginning the matter the ende the beginning is the will of god whereby he willeth and appointeth the estate of his creatures and it is the most absolute supreme and soueraigne cause of all things that are so farre foorth as they are having nothing either aboue it selfe or out of it selfe to be an impulsiue cause to mooue or incline it and to say otherwise is to make the will of god to be no will indeede mens willes are mooued amp disposed by externall causes out of themselues borrowed from the things whereof deliberation is made because they are to be ruled by equitie and reason and a mans bare will without reason is nothing now god will is not ruled by any other rule of reason or iustice but it selfe is an absolute rule both of iustice and reason a thing is not first of al reasonable amp iust amp the afterward willed by god bu it is first of all willed by god amp thereupon it becom s reasonable and iust the maner of his purpose is a decreed manifestation of two of the most principall attributes of the godhead mercy and iustice amp that with a limitation or restraint of mercy to some of the creatures amp iustice to some others because it was his good will and pleasure and wee are not to imagine that this is a point of crueltie in god for his verie essence or nature is not iustice alone or mercie alone but iustice and mercie both togither and therfore to purpose the declaratio of them both upo his creatures ouer whome he is a soueraigne lorde amp that without other respects upon his very will amp pleasure is no point of iniustice the supreme end of the counsel of god is the manifestatio of his own glory partly in his mercy amp partly in his iustice for in comon equity the end which he propouds unto him self of al his doings must be answerable to his nature which is maiesty amp glory amp as i haue said iustice amp mercy it self and because pauls disputation in the to the romans giues light amp sufficient confirmation to this which i now teach i will stand a litle in opening amp resoluing of the same fro the verse to the he sets downe his griefe conceiued for his brother the iewes amp therwithall that it might not be thought that he spake of malice he doth onely in close and obscure manner insinuate the reiection of that nation this done in the verse he answeres a secrete obiection which might be made on this manner if the iewes be reiected then the worde of god is of none effect that is then the couenant made with the forefathers is void but the couenant can not be void therefore the iewes are not reiected the assumption he takes for graunted and denies the consequence of the proposition and the ground of his deniall is because there is a distinction betweene man and man euen among the iewes whereby some are indeed in the couenant some not and this distinction is prooued by examples the first in this ver that of the children of iacob the common parent of all the iewes some are israel that is truly in the couenant as iacob was amp some are not israell nowe it might be further obiected that the iewes are not only the posterity of iacob but the seed of abraha in whom all nation of the earth are blessed and therefore not to be reiected and to this paul answeres verse alledging a second example of the distinction betweene man and man out of the family of abraham in which some were indeede sonnes some were not for the proofe of this first he settes downe the wordes of the text in moses in isaac shall thy seed be called amp secondly makes an exposition of them with a collection on this maner all they which are the son of the promise are the seed of abraha or the son of god but isaac is a son of promise amp not ismael therefore isaac is the seed of abraha amp heir of the blessing amp not ismael the proposition is in the ver the assumpt o in the ver the coclusion in the ver here mark i how he makes a double seed one according to the flesh the other spirituall amp two kinde of sonnes one of the flesh the other the son of the promise or the son of god for he puts the one for the other ii that the distinctio betwene isaac amp ismael wherby one is in the couenat of grace the other not stands not in their foreseene faith amp unbelief amp the fruits of the but in the purpose amp wil of god it selfe for isaac is called the child of promise because by the vertue of it he was borne amp beleeued amp was adopted the child of god amp made heire of the couenat giue to abraha amp therefore consequently the right of adoption befell him by the meere good pleasure of god which is the first cause of our saluation without respect of any thing in the person of isaac for what god by his promise brings to passe in time that he most freely decreed before all times now cosidering the iewes might say that ismael was reiected because he was born of the handmaid hagar wheras they for their partes descend of abraha amp sara by isaac the lawful son paul addes a third exaple of the distinctio betwene man amp ma out of the family of isaac in which iacob was a true son and heire of the promise and esau was not now the distinction of these two persons is propounded in the ver amp confirmed v in which are set down things i the time of this distinction yer the chil re were born amp therfore whe they had neither don good nor evill and this circustance is noted to shewe that god was not mooued by any prevision or preconsideratio of iacobs godlinesse and esaus prophanenesse to preferre the one before the other ii the ende why the distinction was made at this time and not afterward when they were borne is that the purpose of god vvhich is according to his election might remaine sure not of workes but by him that calleth that is that by this meanes it might appeare that when god receiues any man into the couenant of eternal life it proceeds not of any dignitie in the man whome god calleth but fro his mercy amp alone good pleasure that his decree of sauing the elect might remaine firme and sure for euer hence it is manifest that there is an unchangeable decree of election of some man for he that takes all and excepts none can not be said to choose to saluation depending upon the alone will of god and therfore necessarily by the law of contraries there is an opposite decree of reprobation for in that god ordaineth some to eternall saluation he testifies therby that his purpose is to passe by some without shewing of mercy iii the authour of this distinction god himselfe by his purpose before all times which purpose he made manifest by testimonie giuen to rebecca saying the greater shall serve the younger that is the first borne and more excellent according to the flesh shall loose his birthright amp the blessing of his father and in respect of title to the couenant be subiect to the yonger and because this testimony concerning the freedome and seruitude of iacob and esau might seeme insufficient to proue the election of the first amp the reiectio of the secod therfore paul addes a second testimony out of malachi i haue loved iacob and hated esau that is i haue purposed to loue iacob amp to hate esau and these wordes no doubt are alledged to expound the former place out of moses and shewe that the bondage of esau was ioyned with the hatred of god amp the freedome of iacob with the loue of god as tokens thereof against this receiued expositio of the former words which i haue now propounded sundry exceptions are made first that the prerogatiue of isaac aboue ismael amp iacob aboue esau was only in temporarie blessings in that god vouchsafed unto the the right of the lad of canaan ans if these places are to be understood of teporall blessings amp not spiritual then the apostle hath not fitly alledged the former examples to prooue the reiectio of the iewes from the couenant for though it be graunted there be a difference betweene man and man in respect of earthly blessings yet doth it not follow that there shall be the same difference in things concerning the kingdome of heauen if a father for some cause disinherite one or two of his children it were absurd thereupon to conclude that he might therefore kill any of the rest againe the land of canaan was not onely an earthly inheritace but also a pledge and figure vnto our forefathers of a better inheritance in heauen and therefore the excluding of ismael and esau from the land of canaan was a signe that they were excluded from the couenant of grace and the right of eternall life some others say that by iacob and esau are not meant two persons but the two nation of the idumeans and the israelites answer it is a manifest vntruth for it was not possible for two nation to striue in the wombe of rebecca vnlesse we consider them as they were comprehended vnder there two heads to wit the very persons of iacob and esau and wheras they say that esau in person neuer serued iacob but onely in his posteritie the answer is that iacobs freedome and prerogatiues were spirituall and not temporall which by faith he saw a farre off but inioyed not and therefore proportionally esau was debased to the condition of a servant in respect of his younger brother not so much in respect of his outward estate and condition as in regard of the couenant made with his auncetours from which he was barred and though it be graunted that by iacob and esau two nation and not two persons are to be vnderstood yet all comes to one head for the recei ing of the nation of the israelites into the couenant and the excluding of the nation of the edomites both descending of iacob and sau serue as well to prooue god eternall election and reprobation as the receiuing and reiecting of one man others say that these words i ha e hated esau are thus to be vnderstood i haue lesse loued esau then iacob but how then shall we say that paul hath fitly alleadged this text to prooue the reiection of the iewe from the fauour of god and the couenant of grace considering that of man whereof one is loued more of god the other lesse both may still remaine in the couenant lastly it is alleadged that the former exposition makes ismael and esau damned persons answer wee must leaue vnto god all secret iudgement of particular persons and yet neuerthelesse paul doeth very fitly in there two persons both descending of abraham and both circumcised set foorth examples of such as for all their outwarde prerogatiues are indeede barred from the couenant of life euerlasting before god and againe the opposition made by paul requires that the contrarie to that which is spoken of isaac and iacob should be saide of ismael and esau and there is nothing spoken of either of them in the scriptures which argues the disposition of man ordained to eternall life ismael is noted with the brande of a mocker and esau of a prophane man to proceede in the text because the doctrine of paul deliuered in the former verses might seeme straunge vnto the romanes therefore in the verse hee laies downe an obiection and answeares the same the obiection is this if god put distinction betweene man and man without respect had to their persons vpon his owne will and pleasure then hee is vniust but hee is not vniust therefore hee makes no such distinction the answeare is god forbid whereby he denies the consequence of the proposition on this manner though god should elect some to saluation and reiect some others and that vpon his will yet were there no iniustice with god the reason of this answeare followes in the verse god hath absolute povver of will whereby without beeing bound to any creature he may and can first of all haue mercie on whome he will and secondly harden whome he wil for the proofe of the first that god hath mercie on whome he will he laies downe the testimonie of moses verse i will haue mercie on him on whome j will shew mercie and i will haue compassion on him on whome i will haue compassion and in verse makes his collection thence that it namly the purpose of god according to election v is not in him that willeth or in him that runneth but in god that shevveth mercie whereby hee teacheth that the free election of god in order goes before all things that may in time befall man and that therefore neither the intentions and indeauours of the minde nor the workes of our life which are the effects of election can be the impulsive causes to mooue god to choose vs to saluation the second that god hardens whome he will is confirmed and made plaine by the testimonie of scripture concerning pharao verse in the verse there followes an other obiection arising out of the answeare to the former on this manner if god will haue some to be hardened and reiected and his will can not be resisted then with no iustice can he punish them that are necessarily subiect to his decree but god will haue some to be hardened and reiected and his will can not be resisted therefore saith the aduersarie with no iustice can he punish man that is necessarily subiect to his decree here marke that if there had beene an vniuersall election of all man and if man had beene elected or reiected according as god did foresee that they would beleeue or not beleeue the occasion of this obiection had beene cut off but let vs come to pauls answeare in the verse he takes the assumption for graunted that some are reiected because god will and that the will that is the decree of god can not be resisted and onely denies the coherence of the preposition checking the malipert pride of the aduersarie and shewing that the making of this wicked and blasphemous collection against the will of god is as if a man should sue god at the lawe and bring him as it were to the barre and pleade against him as his equall whereas indeede the creature is nothing to the creator and is absolutely to submit it selfe to his will in all things in verse he proceeds to a second answeare shewing that god will is not to be blamed because by his absolute soueraignitie and the right of creation he hath power to chose man or to reiect and harden them and where there is right and power to doe a thing the wil of the doer is not to be blamed now that god hath this right and power ouer his creature it is prooued by a comparison from the lesse to the greater on this manner the potter hath power ouer the clay to make of the same lumpe one vessell to honour and an other to dishonour therefore may god much more make some vessells of mercie and some vessells of wrath prepared to destruction the first part of the comparison is verse the second part verse and least any man should thinke that god makes vessells of honour and dishonour without sufficient and iust cause in himselfe as the potter may doe therfore he sets downe ends of the will of god he makes vessels of dishonour to shew his wrath and to make manifest his power and againe he condemnes no man till he haue suffered him with long patience and he makes vessels of honour that he might declare the riches of his glorie vpon them hence it is manifest first that the ende of predestination is the glorie of god which is to be made manifest partly in his iustice and partly in his mercie secondly that man are not elected or refused of god for their foreseene corruptions or vertues for then paul would not haue said that god made vessells of dishonour but that beeing so alreadie he left them in their dishonour thus from the verse of this chapter to the paul hath described vnto vs the doctrine of god eternall predestination and that by the iudgement august beda tho aquinas on this place of diuines in all ages the order of god predestination is this it is the propertie of the reasonable creature to conceiue one thing after an other whereas god conceiues all things at once with one acte of vnderstanding and all things both past and to come are present with him and therefore in his eternall counsell he decrees not one thing after an other but all things at once neuerthelesse for our vnderstandings sake we may distinguish the counsell of god concerning man into two acts or degrees the first is the purpose of god in him selfe in which he determines what he will doe and the end of all his doings and that is to create all things specially man for his owne glorie partly by shewing on some man his mercie and vpon others his iustice the second is an other purpose whereby he decrees the exequution of the former and laies downe meanes of accomplishing the ende thereof these two acts of the counsell of god are not to be seuered in any wise nor confounded but distinctly considered with some difference for in the first god decrees some man to honour and some to dishonour and this man more then that vpon his will and pleasure and there is no other cause hereof knowne to vs in the second knowne and manifest causes are set downe of the exequution of the former decree for no man is actually condemned but for their sinnes and no man is actually saued but for the merit of christ furthermore this latter acte of the counsell of god must be conceiued of vs in the second place and not in the first for euermore the first thing to be intended is the ende it selfe and then afterward the subordinate meanes and causes whereby the end is accomplished againe the second acte of god counsell containes two other one which sets downe the preparation of the means whereby god predestination begins to come in exequution and they are two the creation of man righteous after the image of god the voluntarie fall of adam and withall the shutting vp of all man vnder damnation the other appoints the applying of the seuerall meanes to the persons of man that god decree which was set downe before all times may in time be fully accomplished as shall afterward in particular appeare predestination hath two parts the decree of election the decree of reprobation or no election this diuision is plaine by that which hath bene said out of the cap to the rom and it may be further confirmed by other testimonies of some it is said that the lord knowes who are his and of some others christ shall say in the day of iudgement j neuer knew you in the acts it is said that as many of the gentiles as were ord ined to life euerlasting beleeued and iude saith of false prophets that they were ordained to condemnation in handling the decree of election i will consider three things i what election is ii the exequution thereof iii the knowledge of particular election for the first god election is a decree in which according to the good pleasure of his will he hath certenly chosen some me to life eternal in christ for the praise of the glorie of his grace this is the same which paul saith to the ephesians god hath chosen vs in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in loue who hath predestinate vs to be adopted through jesus christ vnto himselfe according to the good pleasure of his will nowe that we may the better conceiue this doctrine let vs come to a consideration of the seuerall points thereof first of all i say election is god decree for there is nothing in the world that comes to pas e either vniuersally or particularly without the eternall amp vnchangeable decree of god and therefore whereas man are actually chosen amp brought to life euerlasting it is because god did purpose with himselfe and decree the same before all worlds now touching the decree it selfe sixe things are to be obserued the first what was the motiue or impulsiue cause that mooued god to decree the saluation of any ma answer the good pleasure of god for paul saith he will haue mercie on whome he will haue mercie and he hath predestinate vs according to the good pleasure of god as for the opinion of them that say that foreseene faith and good workes are the cause that mooued god to choose man to saluatio it is friuolous for faith and good works are the fruits and effects of god election paul saith he hath chosen vs not because he did foresee that we would become holy but that we might be holy and he hath predestinate vs to adoption which is all one as if he had said he hath predestinate vs to beleeue because adoption comes by beleeuing now if man are elected that they might beleeue then are they not elected because they would beleeue for it can not be that one thing should be both the cause amp the effect of another the second point is that god electio is vnchangeable so as they which are indeed chosen to saluation can not perish but shall without faile attaine to life euerlasting paul takes it for a conclusion that the purpose of god according to election must remaine firme and sure and againe that the gifts and calling of god are without repentance and samuel saith the strength of israel will not lie or repent for he is not a man that he should repent such as god nature is such is his will and counsell but his nature is vnchangeable i am iehovah saith he and i chaunge not therefore his will likewise and his counsells be vnchangeable and therefore whensoeuer the spirit of god shall testifie vnto our spirits that we are iustified in christ and chosen to saluation it must be a meanes to comfort vs and to stablish our hearts in the loue of god as for the opinion of them that say the elect may fall from grace and be damned it is full of hellish discomfort and no doubt from the deuill and the reasons commonly alleadged for this purpose are of no moment as may appeare by the skanning of them first they obiect that the churches of the ephesians thessalonians and the dispersed iewes are all called elect by the apostles themselues yet sundrie of them afterward fell away answer i there are two kinds of iudgemet to be giuen of man the iudgement of certentie amp the iudgement of charitie by the first indeed is giuen an infallible determination of any mans election but it belongs vnto god principally amp properly amp to man but in part namely so farforth as god shal reueale the estate of one man vnto an other now the iudgement of charitie belongs vnto all man amp by it leauing all secret iudgemets vnto god we are charitably to think that al those that liue in the church of god professing themselues to be members of christ are indeede elect to saluation till god make manifest otherwise and on this manner amp not otherwise do the apostles cal whole churches elect ii they are called elect of the principal part and not because euery member thereof was indeed elect as it called an heape of corne though the bigger part be chaffe secondly it is alleadged that dauid praies that his enemy may be blotted out of the booke of life which is the election of god and that moses and paul did the like against themselues answear dauids enemy had not their names written in the booke of life but onely in the iudgement of man thus iudas so long as he was one of the disciples of christ was accounted as one hauing his name written in heauen now hence it follows that mens names are blotted out of god booke when it is made cleare and manifest vnto the worlde that they were neuer indeede written there and where moses saith forgiue them this sinne if not blotte me out of thy booke and paul i could wish to be accursed ampc there meaning was not to signifie that man elected to saluation may become reprobates onely they testifie their zealous affections that they could be cotent to be depriued of their owne saluation rather then the whole bodie of the people should perish and god loose his glorie as for that which christ saith haue i not chosen you twelue and one of you is a deuill is to be vnderstood not of election to saluation but of election to office of an apostle which is temporarie and changeable the third point is that there is an actuall election made in time beeing indeede a fruit of god decree and answearable vnto it and therefore i added in the description these words whereby he hath chosen some man all man by nature are sinners and children of wrath shut vp vnder one and the same estate of condemnation and actuall election is when it pleaseth god to euer and single out some man aboue the rest out of this wretched estate of the wicked worlde and to bring them to the kingdome of his owne son thus christ saith of his owne disciples i haue chosen you out of the world the fourth point is the actuall or reall foundation of god election and that is christ and therefore wee are said to be chosen to saluation in christ he must be considered two waies as he is god we are predestinate of him euen as we are predestinate of the father and the h ghost as he is our mediatour we are predestinate in him for when god with himselfe had decreed to manifest his glorie in sauing some man by his mercie he ordained further the creation of man in his owne image yet so as by his owne fall he should infold himselfe and all his posteritie vnder damnation this done he also decreed that the word should be incarnate actually to redeeme those out of the former miserie whome he had ordained to saluation christ therefore himselfe was first of all predestinate as he was to be our head and as peter saith ordained before all worlds and we secondly predestinate in him because god ordained that the exequution of mans election should be in him here if any demaund how we may be assured that christ in his passion stoode in our roome and steade the resolution will bee easie if wee consider that hee was ordained in the eternall counsell of god to be our suretie and pledge and to be a publike person to represent all the elect in his obedience and sufferings and therefore it is that peter saith that he vvas deliuered by the foreknovvledge and determinate counsell of god and paul that grace vvas given vnto vs through christ iesus before the vvorlde vvas the fifth point is concerning the number of the elect and that i expressed in these words hath chosen some man to saluation if god should decree to communicate his glorie and his mercie to all and euery man there could be no election for he that takes all can not be said to choose therefore christ saith many are called but few are chosen some make this question how great the number of the elect is and the answeare may be this that the elect considered in themselues be innumerable but considered in comparison to the whole world they are but fewe hence it follows necessarily that sauing grace is not vniuersall but indefinite or particular vnlesse we will against common reason make the streames more large and plentifull then the very fountaine it selfe and this must excite vs aboue all things in the world to labour to haue fellowship with christ and to be partakers of the speciall mercie of god in him yes to haue the same sealed vp in our heartes benefits common to all as the light of the sun ampc are not regarded of any things common to fewe though they be but temporall blessings are sought for of all god giues not riches to all man but to some more to some lesse to some none and hereupon how doe man like drudges toile in the world from day to day and from yeare to yeare to inrich themselues therefore much more ought man to seeke for grace in christ considering it is not common to all we must not content our selues to say god is mercifull but we must goe further and labour for a certificate in the conscience that we may be able to say that god is indeede mercifull to vs when the disciples would haue knowne how many should be saued he omitting the question answeares thus striue to enter in at the straight gate the last point is the ende of god election and that is the manifesting of the praise and excellencie of the glorious grace of god thus hauing seene what election is let vs nowe come to the exequution thereof of which remember this rule man predestinate to the ende that is eternall life are also predestinate to the subordinate meanes whereby they come to eternall life and these are vocation iustification sanctification glorification for the first he that is predestinate to saluation is also predestinate to be called as paul saith whome he hath predestinate them also he calleth secondly whome god calleth they also were predestinate to beleeue therefore sauing faith is called the faith of the elect and in the acts as many as were ordained to life euerlasting beleeued thirdly whome god hath predestinate to life them he iustifieth as paul saith whome he hath predestinate them he calleth and whome he calleth them he iustifieth fourthly whome he hath predestinate to life them he hath predestinate to sanctification and holines of life as peter saith that the iewes were elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father vnto sanctification of the spirit lastly they that are predestinate to life are also predestinate to obedience as paul saith to the ephesians ye are the workemanship of god created in christ iesus vnto good workes vvhich god hath ordained that vve should walke in them this rule beeing the truth of god must be obserued for it hath speciall vse first of all it serues to stoppe the mouthes of vngodly and prophane man they vse to bolster vp them selues in their sinnes by reasoning on this manner if i be predestinate to eternall life i shall be saued whatsoeuer come of it and howe wickedly and leudly soeuer i liue i will therefore liue as i list and follow the swinge of mine owne will but alas like blinde biards they thinke they are in the way but they rush their heads against the wall and farre deceiue them selues for the case stands thus all man that are ordained to saluation are likewise ordained in the counsell of god to vse all the good meanes whereby they may come to saluation and therefore all the elect that liue in this worlde shall be called iustified sanctified and lead their liues in all good conscience before god amp man and they that liue and continue in their owne wicked waies disputing on this manner if i be ordained to saluation i shall not be damned ouershut themselues and as much as they can plunge them selues headlong into the very pitte of hell and for a man to liue and die in his sinnes let the world dispute as they will it is an vnfallible signe of one ordained to damnation secondly there be others that thinke that the preaching of the word the administration of the sacraments admonitions exhortations lawes good orders and all such good meanes are needelesse because god counsells be vnchaungeable if a man shall be condemned nothing shall helpe if a man be saued nothing shall hinder but we must still for our part remember that god doth not onely ordaine the ende but also the meanes whereby the end is compassed and therefore the very vse of all prescribed meanes is necessarie and for this cause we must be admonished with diligence to labour and vse all good meanes that we may be called by the ministerie of the gospell and iustified and sanctified and at length glorified if a king should giue vnto one of his subiects a princely pallace vpon condition that he shall goe vnto it in the way which he shall prescribe oh what paines would the man take to know the way and afterward to keepe amp continue in it but behold the kingdome of heauen is the most glorious and roiall pallace that euer was and god hath bestowed the same on his elect and he requires nothing at their hands but that they would turne their faces from this world and walke vnto it in the way which he hath chalked forth vnto them in his word therefore if we would haue life euerlasting wee must come forth of the broad way that leades to destruction and enter into the straight way that leades to eternall life we must acquaint our selues with the guides which are the ministers of the word that will crie vnto vs here is the way walke ye in it when we goe to the right hand or to the left vocation iustification sanctification repentance new obedience are the markes of the way and we must passe by them all and thus our wearie soules weltring a while in this world shall at length be receiued into euerlasting happines touching the knowledge of particular election two speciall points are to be skanned i whether a man may know his election ii how it may be knowne for the first papists are of minde that no man can certenly know his owne election vnlesse he be certified thereof by some speciall reuelation from god but the thing is false and erronious which they say vvhen the disciples of our sauiour christ returned from preaching and shewed what wonders they had done and how deuills were subiect vnto them the text saieth they reioyced greatly but christ answeared them againe saying in this reioyce not but rather reioyce that your names are vvritten in heauen vvhereby hee signifies that man may attaine to a certen knovvledge of their ovvne election for we can not neither doe we reioyce in things either vnknowne or vncerten saint peter saith giue all diligence to make your election sure now in vaine were it to vse diligence if the assurance of election could not be compassed without an extraordinarie reuelation and paul saith to the corinthians prooue your selues whether ye be in the faith or not where he takes it for graunted that he which hath faith may know that he hath faith and therefore may also know his election because sauing faith is an vnfallible marke of election the second point is how any man may come to know his owne election and there be two waies of knowing it the one is by ascending vp as it were into heauen there to search the counsell of god and afterwarde to come downe to our selues the second by descending into our owne hearts to goe vp from our selues as it were by iacobs ladder to god eternall counsell the first way is daungerous and not to be attempted for the waies of god are vnsearchable and past finding out the second way alone is to be followed which teacheth vs by signes and testimonies in our selues to gather what was the eternal counsel of god concerning our saluation and these testimonies are two the testimonie of god spirit and the testimonie of our spirits as paul saith the spirit of god beareth witnes together with our spirits that we are the sonnes of god touching the testimonie of god spirit two questions may be demaunded the first is by what meanes the spirit of god giueth a particular testimonie in a mans conscience of his adoption answer it is not done by any extraordinarie reuelation or enthusiasme that is an ordinarie reuelation without the word but by an application of the promises of the gospell in the forme of a practicall syllogisme on this manner whosoeuer beleeueth in christ is chosen to life euerlasting this proposition is set downe in the word of god and it is further propounded opened and applied to all that be in the church of god by the ministers of the gospell set apart for this ende now while the hearers of god worde giue themselues to meditate and consider of the same promise comes the spirit of god and inlightens the eyes and opens the heart and giues them power both to will to beleeue amp to beleeue indeed so as a man shall with freedome of spirit make an assumption and say but i beleeue in christ i renounce my selfe all my ioy and comfort is in him flesh and blood cannot say this it is the operation of the holy ghost and hence ariseth the blessed conclusion which is the testimonie of the spirit therefore i am the child of god the second question is how a man may discerne between the illusion of the deuill and the testimonie of the spirit for as there is a certen perswasion of god fauour from god spirit so there be sleights and frauds of the deuill whereby he flatters and soothes man in their sinnes and there is in all man naturall presumption in shew like faith indeede no faith and this counterfait mocke faith is farre more common in the world then true faith is take a view hereof in our ignorant and carelesse people aske any of them whether he be certen of his saluation or no he will without any bones making protest that he is fully perswaded and assured of his saluation in christ that if there be but one man in a country to be saued it is he that he hath serued god alwaies amp done no man hurt that he hath euermore beleeued and that he would not for all the world so much as doubt of his saluation these and such like presumptious conceits in blinde and ignorant persons runne for currant faith in the worlde nowe the true testimonie of the spirit is discerned from naturall presumption and all illusions of the deuill by two effects and fruits thereof noted by paul in that he saith that the spirit makes vs crie abba that is father the first is to pray so earnestly with groanes and sighes as though a man would euen fill heauen and earth with the crie not of his lippes but of his heart touched with sense and feeling of his manifolde sinnes and offences and this indeede is a speciall and principall note of the spirit of adoption nowe looke vpon the loose and carelesse man that thinks himselfe so filled with the perswasion of the loue and fauour of god ye shall finde that he very seldome or neuer praies and when he doth it is nothing else but a mumbling ouer the lord praier the creede and the tenne commaundements for fashions sake which argues plainely that the perswasion which he hath of god mercie is of the flesh and not of the spirit the second fruit is the affection of a duetifull childe to god a most louing father and this affection makes a man stande in feare of the maiestie of god wheresoeuer he is and to make conscience of euery euill way nowe those that are carried away with presumption so soone as any occasion is giuen they fall straight into sinne without mislike or stay as fire burnes with speede vvhen drie vvoode is laide vnto it in a worde where the testimonie of the spirit is truly wrought there be many other graces of the spirit ioyned therewith as when one branch in a tree buddeth the rest budde also the testimonie of our spirit is the testimonie of the heart and conscience purified and sanctified in the bloode of christ and it testifieth two waies by inward tokens in it selfe by outward fruits inward tokens are certen speciall graces of god imprinted in the spirit whereby a man may certenly be assured of his adoption these tokens are of two sorts they either respect our sinnes or god mercie in christ the first are in respect of sinnes past present or to come the signe in the spirit which concerneth sinnes past is godly sorrow which i may tearme a beginning and mother grace of many other gifts and graces of god it is a kinde of griefe conceiued in heart in respect of god and the nature of it may the better be conceiued if we compare it with the contrarie worldly sorrowe springs of sinne and it is nothing else but the horrour of conscience and the apprehension of the wrath of god for the same now godly sorrow it may indeede be occasioned by our sinnes but it springs properly of the apprehension of the grace and goodnes of god worldly sorrow is a griefe for sinne onely in respect of the punishment godly sorrowe is a liuely touch and griefe of heart for sinne because it is sinne though there were no punishment for it now that no man may deceiue himselfe in iudgeing of this sorrow the holy ghost hath set downe seuen fruits or signes thereof whereby it may be discerned the first is care to leaue all our sinnes past the second is apologie whereby a man is mooued and carried to accuse and condemne himselfe for his sinnes past both before god and man the third is indignation whereby a man is exceedingly angrie with himselfe for his offences the fourth is feare least he fal into his former sins againe the is desire wherby he craueth strength and assistance that his sinnes take not hold on him as before the sixth is zeale in the performance of all good duties contrarie to his special sinnes the seuenth is reuenge whereby he subdues his bodie least it should hereafter be an instrument of sinne as it hath beene in former time now when any man shall feele these fruits in himselfe he hath no doubt the godly sorrow which here we speake of the token which is in regard of sinnes present is the combate betweene the flesh and the spirit proper to them that are regenerate who are partly flesh and partly spirit it is not the checke of conscience which all man finde in themselues both good and badde so oft as they offende god but it is a fighting and striuing of the minde will and affections with themselues whereby so farreforth as they are renewed they carrie the man one way and as they still remaine corrupt they carrie him flat contrarie man hauing the disease called ephialies when they are halfe asleepe feele as it were some weightie thing lying vpon their breasts and holding them downe nowe lying in this case they striue with their hands and feete and with all the might they haue to raise vp themselues and to remooue the weight and cannot behold here a liuely resemblance of this combate the flesh which is the inborne corruption of mans nature lies vpon the hearts of the children of god and presseth them downe as if it were the very weight of a mountaine now they according to the measure of grace receiued striue to raise vp themselues from vnder this burden amp to doe such things as are acceptable to god but can not as they would the token that respects sinne to come is care to preuent it that this is the mark of god children appeareth by the saying of john hee that is borne of god sinneth not but keepeth himselfe that the wicked one touch him not and this care shewes it selfe not onely in ordering the outward actions but euen in the verie thoughtes of the heart for where the gospell is of force it brings every thought into captivitie to the obedience of christ and the apostles rule is followed whatsoever things are true whatsoeuer things are honest ampc thinke on these things the tokens which concerne god mercy are especially two the first is when a man feeles him selfe distressed with the burden of his sinnes or when he apprehends the heauie displeasure of god in his conscience for them then further to feele how he stands in need of christ amp withall heartily to desire yes to hunger and thirst after reconciliation with god in the merite of christ and that aboue all other things in the world to all such christ hath made most sweete and comfortable promises which can appertaine to none but to the elect ioh if any man thirst let him come to me and drinke hee that beleeveth in me as saieth the scripture out of his bellie shall flow river of water of life reverand i will give unto him which is a thirst of the vvell of the water of life freely now if hee that thirsteth drinke of these water marke what followeth ioh whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never be more a thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life the second is a straunge affection wrought in the heart by the spirit of god whereby a man doth so esteeme amp value and as it were set so high a price on christ amp his righteousnesse that hee accounts euen the most pretious things that are to be but as dung in regard thereof this affection was in paul and it is expressed in the parable in which after a man hath found a treasure he first hides it and the selles all hee hath and makes a purchase of the fielde where it is now euery man will say of himselfe that he is thus affected to christ and that hee more highly esteemes the least drop of his blood then all things in the world beside wheras indeed most man are of esaus minde rather desiring the red broth then isaaks blessing and of the same affection with the israelites which liked better the onyons and flesh pots of egypt then the blessings of god in the land of promise therefore that no man may deceiue him selfe this affection may bee discerned by two signes the first is to loue and like a christian man because hee is a christian for hee that doth aright esteeme of christ doth in like manner esteeme of the members of christ and of this very thing our sauiour christ saith he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets revvarde and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive the revvarde of a righteous man and saint john saieth hereby vvee knovve that vvee are translated from death to life because vvee love the breethren that is such as are members because they are so the second signe of this affection is a loue and desire to the comming of christ whether it be by death unto any man particularly or by the last iudgement universally and that for this ende that there may be a full participation of fellowship with christ and that this verie loue is a note of adoption it appeares by that which s paul saieth that the crowne of righteousnes is laid vp for all them that love the appearing of christ the outwarde token of adoption is new obedience whereby a man endeauours to obey god comandements in his life and conuersation as s john saith hereby wee are sure that we know him if wee keepe his commandements now this obedience must not be iudged by the rigour of the morall lavv for then it should be no token of grace but rather a meanes of damnation but it must be esteemed and considered as it is in the acceptation of god who spares them that feare him as a father spares an obedient son esteeming things done not by the effect and absolute doing of them but by the affection of the doer and yet least any man should heare be deceiued wee must knowe that the obedience which is an infallible marke of the child of god must be thus qualified first of all it must not be done unto some fewe of god commaundements but unto them all without exception herod heard john baptist willingly amp did many things and iudas had excellent things in him as appeares by this that he was content to leaue all and to followe christ and hee preached the gospell of the kingdome in iurie as well as the rest yet alas all this was nothing for the one could not abide to become obedient to the commandement in leauing his brother philips wife and the other would not leaue his couetousnes to die for it vpright amp sincere obedience doth inlarge it selfe to all the commandements as dauid saith i shall not be confounded when i haue respect to all thy commandements and s iames saith hee which faileth in one law is guiltie of all that is the obedience to many commandements is indeed before god no obedience but a flat sinne if a man wittingly and willingly faile in any one thing he that repents of one sinne truly doth repent of all amp he that liues but in one known sinne without repentace though he pretend neuer so much reformation of life indeed repents of no sinne secodly this obedience must extend it selfe to the whole course of a mans life after his conversion and repentance we must not iudge of a man by an action or two but by the tenour of his life such as the course of a mans life is such is the man though he through the corruption of his nature faile in this or that particular action yet doth it not preiudice his estate before god so be it he renew his repentance for his seuerall slippes and falles not lying in any sinne and withall from yere to yere walke unblameable before god amp man s paul saith the foundation of god remaineth sure the lorde knowes who are his now some might hereupon say it is true indeed god knowes who are his but how may i be assured in my selfe that i am his to this demaund as i take it paul answers in the next words let euery one that calleth on the name of the lord depart from iniquity that is let man invocate the name of god praying seriously for things whereof they stand in need withall giuing thanks amp departing fro all their former sinnes and this shall be unto them an infallible token that they are in the election of god thirdly in outward obedience it is required that it proceede from the whole man as regeneration which is the cause of it is thorough the whole man in bodie soule and spirit againe obedience is the fruite of loue and loue is from the pure heart the good conscience and faith unfained thus we haue heard the testimonies and tokens wherby a man may be certified in his conscience that be was chosen to saluation before all worldes if any desire further resolution in this point let them meditate upon the psalm and the first epistle of saint john being parcels of scripture penned by the holy ghost for this ende here some will demaund how a man may be assured of his adoption if he want the testimony of the spirit to certifie him thereof ansvvere fire is knowen to be no painted but a true fire by two notes by heate and by the flame now if the case fall out that the fire want a flame it is still knowen to be fire by the heate in like manner as i haue said there be two witnesses of our adoption god spirit amp our spirit now if it fall out that a man want the principall which is the spirit of adoption he must then haue recourse to the second witnesse and search out in himselfe the signes and tokens of the sanctification of his owne spirit by which he may certenly assure him selfe of his adoption as wee knowe fire to be fire by the heate though it want a flame againe it may be demanded on this manner how if it come to passe that after inquirie we finde but fewe signes of sanctification in our selues ansvver in this case we are to haue recourse to the least measure of grace lesse then which there is no sauing grace and it stands in two things an heartie disliking of our sinnes because they are sinnes amp a desire of reconciliation with god in christ for them all amp these are tokens of adoption if they be soundly wrought in the heart though all other tokens for the present seeme to be wanting if any shall say that a wicked man may haue this desire as balaam who desired to die the death of the righteous the answere is that balaam indeede desired to die as the righteous man doeth but hee could not abide to liue as the righteous hee desired the ende but not the proper subordinate meanes which tend unto the end as vocation iustification sanctification repentance ampc the first is the worke of nature the second is the worke of grace now i speake not this to make man secure and to content them selues with these small beginnings of grace but onely to shew how any may assure themselues that they are at the least babes in christ adding this withall that they which haue no more but these small beginnings must be carefull to increase them because hee which goes not forwarde goes backwarde lastly it may be demanded what a man should doe if he want both the testimonie of god spirit and his owne spirite and haue no meanes in the world of assurance answer he must not utterly despaire but be resolued of this that though hee want assurance now yet he may obtaine the same hereafter and such must be aduertised to heare the word of god preached and being outwardly of the church to receiue the sacraments when we haue care to come into the lordes vineyard and to converse about the wine presse wee shall finde the sweete iuyce of heauenly grace pressed forth unto us plentifully by the word and sacraments to the comfort of our consciences concerning god election this one mercy that god by these meanes in some parte reveales his mercie is unspeakeable when sickenesse or the day of death comes the dearest servant of god it may be must encounter with the temptations of the deuill and wrastle in conscience with the wrath and displeasure of god as for life amp death amp no man knowes how terrible these things are but those which haue felte them now when man walke thus through the valley of the shadow of death vnlesse god shoulde as it were open heauen amp streame downe unto us in this world some lightsome beames of his love in christ by the operation of his spirite miserable were the case euen of the righteous thus much of election now followes reprobation in handling whereof we are to obserue three things i what it is ii how god doth execute this decree iii how a man may iudge of the same for the first reprobation is god decree in which because it so pleased him he hath purposed to refuse some man by means of adams fall and their owne corruptions for the manifestation of his iustice first i say it is a decree amp that is euident thus if there be an eternall decree of god whereby he chooseth some man then there must needs be another decree wherby he doth passe by others amp refuse the for electio alwaies implies a refusall againe what god doth in time that hee decreed to doe before time as the case falles out euen with man of meane wisedome who first of all intend with themselues the things to be done and after doe them but god in time refuseth some man as the scripture testifieth and it appeareth to be true by the euent therefore god before all worlds decreed the reiecting of some man now in this decree pointes are to be considered the first is the matter or obiect thereof which is the thing decreed namely the reiection of some man or the manifestatio of his iustice upon them this may seeme strange to mans reason but here we must with all submission strike our topsailes for the worde of god saith as much in plaine termes the apostle iude speaking of false prophets saith that they were of old ordained to this damnation and paul saith in emphaticall termes that god makes vessels of wrath prepared to destruction and that some are reiected whome he opposeth to them which are elected to saluation the second pointe is the impulsiue cause that mooued god to set downe this decree concerning his creature and that was nothing out of himselfe but his very will and pleasure he hardened pharaoh with finall hardnesse of heart because he woulde and therefore he decreed to do so because he would and our sauiour christ saith i thanke thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and man of vnderstanding and hast opened them vnto babes but upo what cause did god so it follows in the next words it is so o father because thy good pleasure is such and if it be in the power and libertie of a man to kill an oxe or a sheepe for his use to hunt and kill the hare and partridge for his pleasure then much more without iniustice may it be in the will and libertie of the creatour o refuse and forsake his creature for his glorie nay it standes more with equitie a thousand folde that all the creatures in heauen and earth should ioyntly serue to set forth the glorie and maiestie of god the creatour in their eternall destruction then the striking of a flie or the killing of a flea should serue for the dignitie of all man in the world for all this it is thought by verie many to be very hard to ascribe unto god that is full of bountie and mercie such a decree amp that upo his verie wil but let us se their reasons first of all they say it is a point of crueltie for god to purpose to create a great part of the world to damnation in hell fire the answere is that by the vertue of this decree god can not be said to create any man to damnation but to the manifestation of his iustice and glorie in his due amp deserued damnation and the doing of this is absolute iustice secondly it is alledged that by this meanes god shall hate his own creature and that before it is but it is an untruth we must distinguish betweene god purpose to hate and actuall hating now indeede god before all worldes did purpose to hate some creatures and that iustly so farre forth as his hating of them will serue for the manifestation of his iustice but he neither hates them indeed nor loues the before they are and therefore actuall hatred comes not in till after the creation who god hath decreed to loue the whe they are once created he begins to loue in christ with actual loue amp whom he hath decreed to hate them being once created he hates in ada with actuall hatred thirdly it is obiected that by this doctrine god shalbe the authour of sinne for he which ordaines to the end ordaines to the means of the end but god ordaines man to the end that is the danation therfore he ordaines them to the means therof that is sin ans the propositio being thus understood he which ordains a man to an end in the same order amp maner ordaines him to the meanes is false for one may be ordained to the ende simply the end being simply good and yet not be simply ordained to the meanes because they may be evill in them selues and onely good in part namely so farre forth as they haue respect of goodnesse in the minde of the ordainer secondly the assumption is false for the supreme ende of god counsell is not damnation but the declaration of his iustice in the iust destruction of the creature neither doth god decree mans damnation as it is damnation that is the ruine of man and the putting of him forth to perishment but as it is a reall execution of iustice thirdly wee must make distinction betwene sin it selfe amp the permissio thereof and betweene the decree of reiection and actuall damnation now the permission of sinne and not sinne it selfe properly is the subordinate meanes of the decree of reiection for when god had decreed to refuse some man hee withall decreed the permission of sinne to which permission man were ordained and sinne it selfe is no effect but onely the consequent of the decree yet so as it is not onely the antecedent but also the efficient and meritorious cause of actuall damnation the third point is the reall foundation of the execution of this decree which is condemnation and that is the voluntarie fall of adam and of all his posteritie in him with the fruite thereof the generall corruption of mans nature for howsoeuer god hath purposed to refuse man because it so pleased him yet when his purpose comes to executio he condemnes no man but for his sinnes and sinne though it were not in the counsell of god an impulsiue cause that mooued him to purpose a refusall yet was it a subordinate meanes of damnation god in wonderfull wisedome ordering and disposing the execution of this decree so as the whole blame and fault of mans destruction should be in him selfe and therefore the lorde in the prophet ose saith one hath destroyed thee but i will helpe thee that is saluation is of god amp the condemnation of man is fro them selues now whereas many deprauing our doctrine say that we ascribe unto god an absolute decree in which hee doth absolutely ordaine man to damnation they may here be answered if by absolute they understand that which is opposed to conditionall then we hold and auouch that all the eternall decrees of god are simple or absolute and not limited or restrained to this or that condition or respect if by absolute they understand a bare and naked decre without reason or cause then wee denie god decrees to be absolute for though the causes thereof be not knowen to us yet causes there be knowen to him and iust they are yes the verie will of god it selfe is cause sufficient it being the absolute rule of iustice and though man in reason can not discerne the equitie and iustice of god will in this point yet may we not thereupon conclude that therefore it is uniust the sun may shine clearely though the blind man see it not and it is a flat mistaking to imagine that a thing must first of all be iust in it selfe and then afterward be willed of god whereas contrariwise god must first will a thing before it can be iust the will of god doeth not depend upon the qualitie and nature of the thing but the qualities of things in order of causes follow the will of god for euerie thing is as god willes it lastly if it be called an absolute decree because it is done without all respect to mans sinne then we still denie it to be absolute for as god condemnes man for sinne so hee decreed to condemne him for and by his sinne yet so as if the question be made what is the cause why hee decrees rather in his iustice to condemne this man then that man no other reason can be rendred but his will the last point is the ende of god decree namely the manifestation of his iustice as salomon saieth the lord hath made all thinges for his ovvne sake and the vvicked for the day of evill and paul saieth that god made vessels of wrath to shevve his vvrath and to make his povver knowen thus we haue seene what reprobation is nowe followes the execution thereof for that which god decrees before time in time he executes and here a speciall rule to be remebred is this those which are ordained to iust danation are likewise ordained to be left to them selues in this worlde in blindnesse of minde and hardnesse of heart so as they neither shall nor will repent of their sinnes the truth of this wee may see in god worde for s peter speaking of the priests and doctours and chiefe of the people among the iewes saieth plainely they stumbled at the word and are disobedient why so the reason is there set downe because they were ordained unto it of olde and so paul saith to the corinthians that hee handled not the worde of god deceitfully but in the declaration of the trueth hee approoved himselfe to euerie mans conscience in the sight of god now hereupon it might be saide how then comes it to passe that all receiue not the gospell in corinthian and to this hee answeres with a terrible sentence if saieth hee our gospell be hid it is hid to them that perish giuing us to understand that god leaues them to themselues in this worlde whome hee purposeth to refuse and the lord by the prophet esai saieth of the iewes by hearing they shall heare and not understand and by seeing they shall see and not perceive least they should heare with their eares and see vvith their eyes and vnderstande with their hearts and so turne and be saved the use of this rule is manifolde first it serueth to ouerthrow the opinion of carnall man which reason thus if i be ordained to damnation let me liue neuer so godly and well i am sure to be damned therefore i will liue as i list for it is not possible for me to alter god decree blasphemous mouthes of man make nothing of this and like speeches and yet they speake flatt contraries for whom god hath purposed in his eternall counsell to refuse them also he hath purposed for their sinnes to leaue to the blindnesse of their mindes and hardnesse of their heartes so as they neither will nor can liue a godly life secondly this rule doeth as it were leade us by the hande to the consideration of the fearefull estate of many people among us wee haue had for the space of thirtie yeeres and more the preaching of the gospell of christ and the more plentifully by reason of the schooles of learning but what hath beene the issue of it i doubt not but in many it hath beene the meanes of their conversion and saluation but to speake generally of the greater parte there is little or no fruite to be seene the most after this long preaching remaine as blinde as impenitent as harde hearted and as unreformed in their liues as euer they vvere though they haue hearde the lorde calling them to repentance from day to day and from yeere to yeere well if this rule be the trueth of god as no doubt it is then i say plainely that there is a most fearefull iudgement of god amongst vs my meaning is not to determine or giue sentence of any mans person of any towne or people neuerthelesse this may be auouched that it is a terrible and daungerous signe of the wrath of god that after this long and daily preaching there is still remaining a generall hardenesse of heart impenitencie and want of reformation in the liues of man the smith stithie the more it is beaten the harder it is made and commonly the heartes of man the more they are beaten with the hammer of god worde the more dull secure and senslesse they are this beeing so it standes euery man in hande to looke to his owne estate wee are carefull to flie the infection of the bodily plague oh then how carefull shoulde wee bee to flie the common blindenesse of minde and hardnesse of heart which is the verie plague of all plauges a thousande folde worse then all the plagues of egypt and it is so much the more fearefull because the more it takes place the lesse it is perceiued when a malefactour on the day of assise is brought foorth of the iayle with great boltes and fetters to come before the iudge as hee is going all man pitie him and speake comfortably unto him but why so because hee is now to be arraigned at the barre of an earthly iudge nowe the case of all impenitent sinners is farre more miserable then the case of this man for they lie fettred in bondage vnder sin amp satan and this short life is the way in which they are going euerie houre to the barre of god iustice who is the king of kings and lord of lord there to be arraigned amp to haue sentence of condemnation giuen against them now canst thou pitie a man that is before an earthly iudge and wilt thou not be touched with the miserie of thine owne estate who goest euery day forward to the barre of god iustice whether thou be sleeping or waking sitting or standing as a man on the sea in a ship goes continually toward the hauen though he himselfe stirre not his foote begin now at length to lay this point to your hearts that so long as ye run on in your blind wayes without repentance as much as yee can yee make poste hast to hell warde and so long as you continue in this miserable condition as peter saieth your iudgement is not farre off and your damnation sleepeth not thirdly seeing those whome god hath purposed to refuse shall be left unto themselues and neuer come to repentance we are to loue and embrace the word of god preached amp taught unto us by the ministers of the gospell withall submitting our selues unto it and suffering the lord to humble us thereby that we may come at length out of the broad way of blindnesse of minde and hardnesse of heart leading to destruction into the straight way of true repentance and reformation of life which leadeth to saluation for so long as a man lives in this world after the lusts of his own heart he goes on walking in the very same broad way to hell in which all that are ordained to condemnation walke and what a fearefull thing is it but for a litle while to be a companion in the way of destruction with them that perish and therefore i say once againe let us all in the feare of god lay his word unto our heartes and heare it with such reuerence as that it may be in us the sworde of the spirite to cut downe the sinnes and corruptions of our natures and worke in us a reformation of life and true repentance the third point concerning the decree of reprobation is the iudgement to be giuen of it this iudgement belongeth to god principally and properly because hee knoweth best what he hath determined cocerning the estate of euery man amp none but he knowes who they be which are ordained to due amp deserued danation and againe he only knoweth the hearts and willes of man and what grace he hath giuen them what they are and what all their sinnes be and so doth no angell nor creature in the world beside as for man it belongs not to them to giue iudgement of reprobation in themselues or in others unlesse god reveale his will unto them and giue them a gift of discerning this gift was bestowed on sundry of the prophets in the old testament and in the new testament on the apostles dauid in many psalmes makes request for the confusion of his enemy not praying only against their sinnes which we may do but euen against their persons which we may not do no doubt he was guided by god spirit amp receiued thence an extraordinarie gift to iudge of the obstinate malice of his aduersaries and paul praies against the perso of demetrius saying the lord reward him according to his doings and such kinde of praiers were lawful in them because they were caried with pure amp upright zeale amp had no doubt a speciall gift whereby they were able to discerne of the finall estate of their enemy againe god sometimes giues this gift of discerning of some mens finall impenitencie to the church upon earth i say not to this or that priuate person but to the bodie of the church or greater part thereof s john writing unto the churches saith there is a sinne unto death that is against the h ghost i say not that thou shouldest pray for it in which words he takes it for granted that the sinne might be discerned by the church in those daies and paul saieth if any man beleeue not the lord iesus let him be had in execration mara natha that is pronounced accursed to euerlasting destruction whence it appeares that the church hath power to pronounce man reiected to euerlasting damnation upon some special occasions though i dare not say ordinarily and usually the primitiue church with one consent praied against iulian the apostata amp the praiers made were not in vaine as appeared by his fearefull end as for priuate and ordinary man for the tempering and rectifying of their iudgements in this case they must follow two rules the one is that euerie member of the church is bound to beleeue his owne election it is the commandement of god binding the very conscience that we should beleeue in christ now to beleeue in christ is not onely to put our affiance in him and to be resolued that we are iustified and sanctified and shalbe glorified by him but also that we were elect to saluatioa in him before the beginning of the world which is the foundation of the rest againe if of things that haue necessarie dependance one upon another we are to beleeue the one then we are to beleeue the other now electio amp adoptio are things conioyned amp the one necessarily dependes upon the other for all the elect as paul saith are predestinate to adoption amp wee are to beleeue our owne adoption amp therefore also our election the second rule is that concerning the persons of those that be of the church wee must put in practise the iudgement of charitie amp that is to esteeme of them as of the elect of god till god make manifest otherwise by vertue of this rule the ministers of god word are to publish and preach the gospell to all without exceptio it is true indeed there is both wheat amp darnell in god field chaffe amp corne in god barne fish amp drosse in god net sheep amp goates in christs fold but secret iudgements belong unto god and the rule of loue which is to thinke and wish the best of others is to be followed of us that professe faith working by loue it may be demanded what we are to iudge of them that as yet are enemy of christ ans our duty is to susped our iudgements concerning their finall estate for we know not whether god will call them or no and therefore we must rather pray for their conversion then for their confusion againe it may be demanded what is to be thought of all our ancetours amp forefathers that liued amp died in the times whe popery took place ans we may well hope the best amp thinke that they were saued for though the papacie be not the church of god and though the doctrine of popery race the foundation yet neuerthelesse in the very midst of the romane papacie god hath alwaies had a remnant which haue in some measure truly serued him in the olde testament when open idolatry took place in all israel god saith to eliah i have reserved thousand to my self that never bowed knee to baal amp the like is amp hath bin in the generall apostasie under antichrist s john saith that when the woman fled into the vvildernes for a time euen then there was a remnant of her seed which kept the comandements of god amp have testimony of iesus christ and againe when ordinary meanes of saluation faile then god can amp doth make a supply by means extraordinary amp therfore there is no cause why we should say that they were condemned thirdly it may be demaded whether the como iudgemet giuen of f spira that hee is a reprobate be good or no ans we may with better warrat say no then any ma say yes for what gifts of discerning had they which came to visit him in his extremitie amp what reasons induced them to giue this peremptorie iudgement he said himselfe that he was a reprobate that is nothing a sick mans iudgement of himselfe is not to be regarded yes but he despaired a senslesse reaso for so doth many a man yeere by yeere amp that very often as deeply as euer spira did amp yet by the good help of the ministery of the worde both are amp may be recouered and they which wil auouch spira to be a reprobate must go further amp prooue things that he despaired both wholly and finally which if they can not proue we for our parts must suspende our iudgementes and they were much to blame that first published the booke lastly it may be demadend what is to be thought of the that make very fearful ends in rauing amp blaspheming ans such strage behauiours are oftetimes the fruites of violent diseases which torment the body amp bereaue the minde of sense amp reason amp therfore if the persons liued wel we must thinke the best for we are not by outward things to iudge of the estate of any man salomon saith that all things come alike to all amp the same condition to the iust amp to the wicked thus much of the parts of predestination now followes the use thereof amp it concernes partly our iudgemets partly our affectios amp partly our liues the uses which concerne iudgement are and first by the doctrine of predestinatio we learne that there ca not be any iustification of a sinner before god by his workes for god election is the cause of iustification because whome god electeth to saluation after this life them he electeth to be iustified in this life now election it selfe is of grace and of grace alone as paul saieth election is by grace and if it be of grace it is no more of workes or else were grace no grace therefore iustification is of grace and of grace alone and i reason thus the cause of a cause is the cause of all things caused but grace alone is the cause of predestination which is the cause of our vocation iustification sanctification ampc grace therefore is also the alone cause of all these therefore the scriptures ascribe not onely the beginning but also the continuace amp accomplishment of all our happinesse to grace for first as election so vocation is of grace paul saieth god hath called vs not according to our vvorkes but according to his purpose and grace againe faith in christ is of grace so it is saide to you it is given to beleeve in christ also the iustification of a sinner is of grace so paul saieth plainely to the romanes you are iustified freely by his grace againe sanctification and the doing of good workes is of grace so it is saide wee are his vvorkemanshippe created in christ iesus vnto good vvorkes vvhich god hath ordained that vvee shoulde vvalke in them also perseverance in good workes and godlinesse is of grace so the lorde saieth i vvill make an everlasting covenant vvith them that i will neuer turne avvay from them to doe them good but i will put my feare in their heartes that they shall not depart from mee lastly life euerlasting is of grace so paul saieth life everlasting is the gift of god through iesus christ now they of the church of rome teach the flatte contrarie they make two iustifications the first whereby a man of an euill man is made a good man the second whereby of a good man hee is made better the first they ascribe to grace but so as the seconde is by workes secondly hence wee learne that the arte of iudiciall astrologie is vaine and frivolous they that practise it doe professe themselues to tell of thinges to come almost whatsoeuer and this they doe by casting of figures and the speciall point of their article is to iudge of mens nativities for if they may know but the time of a mans byrth they take vpon them to tell the whole course of his life from yeare to yeare from weeke to weeke and from day to day from the day of his birth to the houre of his death yes that which is more they professe themselues to tell all things that shall befall man either in bodie goods or good name and what kinde of death they shall die but that this their practise is not of god but indeede unlawful it may appeare by this because it stands not with the doctrine of god predestination two twinnes begotten of the same parents and borne both at one and the same time by the iudgement of astrologians must haue both the same life and the same death and be euery way alike both in goods and in good name yet we see the contrarie to be true in iacob and esau who were borne both at one time of the same parents for iacob tooke esau by the heele so as there could not be much difference betweene them in time yet for all this esau was a fierce man and wilde giuen to hunting but iaacob was milde of nature and liued at home the one had fauour at god hand and was in the couenant but god kept backe that mercie fro the other againe in a pitcht field are slaine a thousand man at one and the same time now if we consider the time of their births it may be they were borne at a thousand sundrie times and therefore vnder so many diverse positions of the heauens and so by the iudgement of all astrologers should haue all diverse and sundrie liues and ends but we see according to the determination of the counsell of god they haue all one and the same ende and therefore this must admonish all those that are brought vp in schooles of learning to haue care to spend there times in better studies and it teacheth those that are fallen into any manner of distresse not to haue recourse to these fond figure casters for their astrologicall iudgements are false and foolish as we may see by the two former examples thirdly the knowledge of god is one of the most speciall points in christian religion and therefore the lord saith let him that reioyce reioyce in this that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me for i am the lord which shew mercie and iudgement in the earth and our sauiour christ saith this is life eternall to know thee the onely very god and whome thou hast sent jesus christ nowe god predestination is a glasse wherein we may behold his maiestie for first by it we see the wonderfull wisdome of god who in his eternall counsell did foresee and most wisely set downe the state of euery man secondly his omnipotencie in that he hath power to saue and power to refuse whome he will thirdly his iustice and mercie hoth ioyned together in the exequution of election his mercie in that he saueth those which were vtterly lost his iustice in that he ordained christ to be a mediatour to suffer the curse of the law and to satisfie his iustice for the elect fourthly his iustice in the exequution of the decree of reprobation for though he decreed to hold back his mercie from some man because it so pleased him yet he condemneth no man but for his sinnes now the cosideration of these amp the like points bring vs to the knowledge of the true god the vses which concerne our affections are these first the doctrine of predestination ministers to all the people of god matter of endlesse consolation for because god election in vnchangeable therefore they which are predestinate to saluation can not perish though the gates of hell preuaile against them so as they be hardly saued yet shall they certenly be saued therefore our sauiour christ saith that in the latter daies shall arise false christs and false prophets which shall shew great signes and wonders so that if it were possible they should deceiue the very elect in which words he takes it for graunted that the elect of god can neuer finally fall away and hereupon he saith to his disciples when they reioyced that the devil were subiect to them rather reioyce that your names are written in heauen and s paul speaking of hymeneus amp alexander which had falne away from the faith least the church would be discouraged by their fall because they were thought to be worthie man amp pillars of the church he doth comfort the from the very ground of election saying the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his where god election is compared to the foundatio of an house the building whereof may be shaken but the ground work standeth fast amp therefore paul saith further who shall lay any thing to the charge of god elect nowe then that we may haue comfort in distresse amp some thing to stay vpon in al our troubles we in this world are as strangers in a farre country our passage homeward is ouer the sea of this world the ship wherin we saile is the church amp satan stirres vp many blasts of troubles amp teptations amp his purpose is to sink the ship or to driue it on the rock but we must take the anchor of hope amp fasten it in heauen vpon the foundation of god election which being done we shal passe in safetie amp reioyce in the midst of all stormes amp tempests secondly whereas god refuseth some man and leaues them to themselues it serues to strike a feare into uery one of vs whatsoeuer as saint paul in the like case saith the iewes being the naturall braunches are broken off through vnbeliefe and thou standest by faith be not high minded but feare this indeed was spoken to the romanes but we must also lay it vnto our hearts for what is the best of vs but a lump of clay amp how soeuer in god counsell we are chosen to saluation yet in our selues we are all shut vp vnder vnbeliefe and are fit to make vessels of wrath our sauiour christ calleth iudas a devil amp we know his leud life amp fearful end now what are we better then iudas by nature if we had bin in his steade without the special blessing of god we should haue don as he did he betraied christ but if god leaue vs to our selues we shal not onely betray him but by our sinnes euen crucifie him a thousand waies furthermore let vs bethinke our selues of this whether there be not alreadie condemned in hel who in their liues were not more grieuous offendours then we esay calleth the people of his time a people of sodom amp gomorrha giuing the iewes then liuing to vnderstad that they were as bad as the sodomites amp as the people of gomorrha on whome the lord had shewed his iudgements long before if this be true then let vs with feare and trembling be thakful to his maiestie that he hath preserued vs hitherto fro deserued danation the vses which respects our liues and conuersations are manifold first seeing god hath elected some to saluation and hath also laid downe the meanes in his holy worde whereby we may come to the knowledge of our particular election we must therefore as saint paul counselleth vs giue all diligence to make our election sure in the world man are carefull and painefull ynough to make assurance of lands and goods to themselues and their posteritie what a shame is it then for vs that we should be slacke in making sure to our selues the election of god which is more worth then all the world beside and if we shall continue to be slacke herein the leases of our lands and houses and all other temporall assurances shall be billes of accusation against vs at the day of iudgement to condemne vs secondly by this doctrine we are taught to liue godly and righteously in this present world because all those whome god hath chosen to saluation he hath also appointed to liue in newnes of life as saint paul saith god hath chosen vs in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and againe we are created in christ iesus vnto good workes which god hath ordained that we should walke in them and god hath chosen you to saluation through sanctification of the spirite and faith of the truth the elect are vessells of honour and therefore all those that will be of the number of the elect must carrie themselues as vessells of honour for so long as they lie in their sinnes they be like vessells of dishonour imploying themselues to the most base seruice that can be euen to the seruice of the deuill the sun was ordained to shine in the day and the moone in the night and that order they keepe yes euery creature in his kind obserueth the course appointed vnto it by creation as the grasse to grow and trees to bring forth fruit now the elect were ordained to this ende to lead a godly life and therefore if we would either perswade our selues or the world that we are indeede chosen to saluation we must be plentifull in all good works amp make conscience of euery euill way and to doe otherwise is as much as to chaunge the order of nature and as if the sun should cease to shine by day and the moone by night thirdly when god shall send vpon any of vs in this world crosses and afflictions either in bodie or in minde or any way else as this life is the vaile of miserie and teares and iudgement must begin at god house we must learne to beare them with all submission and contentation of mind for whome god knew before them he hath predestinate to be made like vnto his son but wherein is this likenes paul saith in the fellowship of his afflictions and in a conformitie to his death and the consideration of this that afflictions were ordained for vs in the eternal predestination of god must comfort our hearts and restraine our impatience so oft as we shall goe vnder the burden of them hence againe we learne that they which perswade themselues that they are in the fauour of god because they liue at ease in wealth and prosperitie are farre deceiued for saint paul saith god suffereth with long patience the vessells of wrath prepared to destruction to make knowne his power and to shew forth his wrath on them which beeing so then no man by outward blessings ought to plead that he hath the loue of god sheepe that goe in fat pastures come sooner to the slaughterhouse then those which are kept vpon the bare and they which are pampered with the wealth of this worlde sooner forsake god and therefore are sooner forsaken of god then others salomon saith no man knoweth loue or hatred that is by outward things for all things come alike to all the same condition is to the iust and to the vniust to the wicked and good to the pure and polluted lastly it may be an offence vnto vs when we consider that the doctrine of the gospel is either not knowne or else despised and persecuted of the whole world but we must stay our selues with this consideration that nothing comes to passe by chance that god knowes who are his and that there must be some in the world on whome god hath in his eternall counsell purposed to manifest his power and iustice againe ministers of the gospell may be discouraged when after long preaching they see little or no fruit of their labours the people whome they teach remaining as blinde impenitent and vnreformed as euer they were but they must also consider that it is the purpose of god to chose some to saluation and to refuse others and that of the first some are called sooner some later and that the second being left to themselues neuer come to repentance to this paul had regard when he saide if our gospell be hid it is hid to them that perish and againe we are vnto god the sweete sauour of christ in them that are saued and in them that perish hitherto i haue deliuered the truth of this weightie point of religion which also is the doctrine of the church of england now it followeth that wee should consider the falshoode sundrie divines haue deuised and in their writings published a new frame or platforme of the doctrine of predestination the effect and substance whereof is this the nature of god say they is infinite loue goodnes and mercie it selfe and therefore he propoundes vnto himselfe an ende answearable thereunto and that is the communication of his loue and goodnes vnto all his creatures now for the accomplishing of this supreame amp absolute ende he did foure things first he decreed to create man righteous in his own image secondly he foresaw the fall of man after his creatio yet so as he neither willed nor decreed it thirdly he decreed the vniuersall redemption of all amp euery man effectually by christ so be it they wil beleeue in him fourthly he decreed to call all amp euery man effectually so as if they will they may be saued this being done he in his eternall counsell foreseeing who would beleeue in christ did thereupon elect them to eternall saluation and againe foreseeing who would not beleeue but contemne grace offered did thereupon also decree to reiect them to eternall damnation this platforme howsoeuer it may seeme plausible to reason yet indeed it is nothing els but a deuise of mans braine as will appeare by sundrie defects and errours that be in it for first whereas it is auouched that adams fall came by the bare presciece of god without any decree or will of his it is a flat vntruth the putting of christ to death was as great a sinne as the fall of adam nay in some respects greater now that came to passe not onely by the foreknowledge of god but also by his determinate counsell and therefore as the church of ierusalem saith herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel gathered themselues togither to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and thy counsell had determined before to be done so may we say that adam in his fall did nothing but that which the hand of god and his counsell had determined before to be done and considering the will of god extends it selfe to the least things that are euen to sparrows whereof none doe light vpon the ground without our heauenly father how can a man in reason imagine that the fall of one of the most principall creatures that are shall fall out altogether without the will and decree of god and there can be nothing more absurd then to seuer the foreknowledge of god from his counsell or decree for by this meanes things shall come to passe god nilling or not knowing or not regarding them now if any thing come to passe god nilling it then that is done which god would not haue done and to say so is to bereaue him of his omnipotencie and if we shall say that things fall out god not knowing of them we make him to be imprudent and denie his omniscience lastly if we shall say that a thing is done god not regarding it we bring in an idole of our owne braines and stablish the idle god of the epicures but it is obiected to the contrarie that if god any way decreed and willed the fall of adam then he was the author of sinne which once to say is blasphemie answear the argument followes not there be three actions in the will of god one whereby he doth absolutely will any thing and delight in it and of all such things god himselfe is the author the second is wholly or absolutely to nill a thing and all thinges thus nilled can not possibly come to passe or haue the least beeing in nature there is also a third action which comes as a meane betweene the two former which is remissely or in part both to nill and will a thing whereby though god approoue not euill as it is euill and therfore doth it not yet he willeth the permitting of it to be done by others or the beeing of it because in respect of god that decreeth the permitting of euill it is good that there should be euill and on this maner and no otherwise god willed the fall of adam and therefore in the reason of any indifferent man though he decreed the fall yet shall he be free from the blame thereof which lies wholly vpon the doer these two caueats alwaies remembred first that god by his will did not constraine or force the will of adam to sinne or infuse into it any corruption and that therefore he sinned willingly and freely only by the decretum dei non tollit libertate voluntatis sed ordinat necessitie of immutabilitie amp not by the necessitie of coaction secondly that god willed the fall for a most worthie end which was to lay downe a way tending to the manifestation both of his iustice and mercie againe it is alleadged that if god willed adams fall then his will is flat contrarie to it selfe because he wills that which he had by expresse commaundement forbidden answer in deede if god should both wil and forbid one and the same thing in one and the same respect there should be a contradiction in god will but that god doth not he forbad adams fall as it was a sinne for so in euery commaundement sinne as it is sinne is condemned and punished and yet because it was in a new respect a meanes of manifesting his glorie who is able to bring light out of darknes therefore he willingly decreed the permission of it incest as it is a sinne it is condemned in the seuenth commandement and punished with death yet as incest was a punishment of dauids adulterie god is said to take his wiues and to giue them to his son absolom some againe as it appeares by their writings feare to ascribe vnto god so much as a permission of adams fall but no doubt they are deceiued for if these rules be true that god is omnipotent that he works all things that are by the counsell of his will and gouernes them that he hath care and regard ouer man that nothing is hid from him that he is vnchangeable there must needs be permission of will if the deuill could not enter so much as into an heard of swine without christs permission shall we thinke that he could compasse the fall and ouerthrow of man without a permission indeed to permit is not to hinder euill when one may and with man this is a fault but not with god because he is not bound to hinder the euill which he permits the second fault is that they make the prescience of mans faith amp vnbeliefe to be the impulsiue causes of god decree for they say that god eternally decrees to saue or refuse man because he did foresee that they would beleeue or not beleeue but indeed it is a manifest vntruth among the causes of al things that are there is an order set down by god himselfe in which order some causes are highest some lowest some in the middest now the highest cause of all is that which ouerrules all and is ouerruled of none and that is god will beyond which there can be no higher cause for god is placed aboue all and subiect to none and this very will of his is the cause of all things that haue beeing for we must not imagine that a thing first of all existeth and then afterward is willed of god but first of all god wills a thing and then afterward it comes to haue beeing nowe to say that foreseene faith or vnbeliefe are the moouing causes whereby god was induced to ordaine man either to saluation or to iust damnation is to vndoe this diuine order of causes and to displace the linkes in that god will is made a secondarie or middle cause subordinate to others causes placed aboue it and this is to make the will of god to depend vpon the qualitie and condition of the creature whereas all things depend vpon it againe paul saith that god hath opened the mysterie of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himselfe whereby he makes a distinction betweene the creature and the creatour man when they purpose the doing of any thing borrowe reasons of their purposes and wills out of themselues from the thinges to be done because mans bare will is no sufficient cause to vvarrant the doing of this or that in this or that manner vnlesse there be iust reason but god will is a simple and absolute rule of righteousnesse and a thing is good so farre forth as god wills it therefore there is no cause why he should goe forth of himselfe for externall inducements and reasons of his eternall counsell his very will in himselfe is a sufficient reason of all his purposes and decrees and hereupon paul saith that god purpose was in himselfe to shew that there is no dependance of his will vpon the creature and that in ordering and disposing of his decrees hee had no reference or respectiue consideration of the qualities and workes of man thirdly by this doctrine there is fastned vpon god want of wisedome who is wisedome it selfe and that is very absurd a simple man that hath in him but a sparke of the wisedome of god first of all intendes with himselfe the ende and euent of the busines to be done and then afterward the meanes whereby the ende is accomplished but in this platforme god is brought in in the first place to foresee and consider with himselfe the meanes which tende to the ende namely the faith and vnbeliefe of man and then afterwarde to determine with himselfe what shall be the ende and finall condition of euery man either in life or death as if a man should purpose with himselfe to builde an house without any consideration of the ende why and afterwarde conceiue with himselfe the particular vses to which hee will applie it fourthly hence it followeth that faith shall not onely be an instrument but also an efficient cause in the acte of iustification of a sinner before god for the cause of a cause is also the cause of the thing caused but foreseene faith is an impulsiue cause whereby god was mooued to choose some man to saluation as it is said and therefore it is not onely an instrument to apprehende christs righteousnes but also a cause or meanes to mooue god to iustifie a sinner because iustification proceedes of election which comes of foreseene faith which is erronious by the doctrine of all churches vnlesse they be popish fifthly this doctrine takes it for graunted that all both young and old euen infants that die in there infancie haue knowledge of the gospell because both faith and vnbeliefe in christ presuppose knowledge of our saluation by him considering that neither ordinarily nor extraordinarily man beleeue or contemne the thing vnknowne but howe false this is euen common experience doth shewe lastly this platforme quite ouerthrowes it selfe for whereas all man equally corrupt in adam are effectually both redeemed and called the difference betweene man and man stands not in beleeuing or not beleeuing for all beleeue but in this properly that some are confirmed in faith some are not now when all without exception are indewed with grace sufficient saluation i demaund why some man are confirmed in grace and others not confirmed as also of angels some were confirmed and stande and some not confirmed fell no other reason can be rendered but the will of god and to this must all come striue as long as they will that of man beeing in one and the same estate some are saued some iustly forsaken because god would againe as the foreseeing of faith doth presuppose god giuing of faith vnlesse man will say it is naturall so the foreseeing of faith in some man alone doth presuppose the giuing of faith to some man alone but why doth not god conferre the grace of constant faith to all because he will not so then those man whose faith was foreseene are saued not because their faith was foreseene but because god would the third faulte is that they ascribe vnto god a conditionall purpose or counsell whereby hee decrees that all man shall be saued so be it they will beleeue for it is euery way as much against common sense as if it had beene said that god decreed nothing at all concerning man a conditionall sentence determines nothing simply but conditionally and therefore vncertenly and when we speake of god to determine vncertenly is as much as if he had determined nothing at all specially when the thing determined is in the power of mans will and in respect of god the decree may come to passe or not come to passe man if they might alwaies haue their choise desire to determine of all their affaires simplie without codition and when they doe otherwise it is either because they knowe not the euent of things or because things to be done are not in their power no reason therefore that we should burden god with that whereof we would disburden our selues againe the maiestie of god is disgraced in this kind of decree god for his part would haue all man to be saued why then are they not man will not keepe the condition and beleeue this is flat to hang god will vpon mans will to make euery man an emperour and god his vnderling and to chaunge the order of nature by subordinating god will which is the first cause to the will of man which is the second cause whereas by the very lawe of nature the first cause should order and dispose the second cause but for the iustifying of a conditionall decree it is alleadged that there is no eternall and hidden decree of god beside the gospell which is god predestination reuealed answer it is an vntruth there be two wills in god quid vult fieri de nobis or in nobis one whereby hee determineth what he will doe vnto vs or in vs the other quid vult fieri nobis whereby he determineth what we shall doe to him now predestination is the first wherupon it is commonly defined to be the preparation of the blessings of god whereby they are deliuered which are deliuered and the gospell is the second againe predestination determines who they are and how many which are to be saued and hereupon christ saith i know whome j haue chosen but the gospell rather determines what kinde of ones and how they must be qualified which are to be saued lastly predestination in god decree it selfe and the gospell is an outward meanes of the exequution of it and therefore though the gospell be propounded with a condition yet the decree of god it selfe may be simple and absolute the fourth defect is the opinion of vniuersall sauing grace appertaining to all and euery man which may be fitly tearmed the schole of vniuersal atheisme for it pulls downe the pale of the church and laies it wast as euery common fielde it breedes a carelessenes in the vse of the meanes of grace the word amp sacraments when as man shall be perswaded that grace shall be offered to euery one effectually whether he be of the church or not at one time or other wheresoeuer or howsoeuer he liue as in the like case if man should be told that whether they liue in the market towne or no there shall be sufficient prouision brought them if they will but receiue it and accept of it who would then come to the market vniuersall grace hath three parts vniuersall election vniuersall redemption vniuersall vocation vniuersall election of all and euery man is a witlesse conceit for if man vniuersally be appointed to grace without exception then there is no electing or choosing of some out of mankinde to grace and if some alone be appointed to grace as it must needes be in election then is not grace vniuersall and it is flat against the word of god for christ auoucheth plainly that fewer be chosen then called and as afterward we shall see all are not called and he further saith that all which are giuen vnto him shall be one with him and haue life euerlasting but all man shall not be one with him and haue life euerlasting and therefore all man are not giuen to christ of the father that is ordained to saluation and the scripture saith that all mens names are not written in the booke of life and that the kingdome of heauen was not prepared for all and whereas man build this their vniuersall election vpon the largenes of the promise of the gospel vpon the like ground they might as wel make an vniuersall decree of reprobation whereby god decrees all man to be damned indefinitely vpon this condition if they doe not beleeue now if vniuersall reprobation be absurd as it is indeede then vniuersall election must take part therewith as for the vniuersal redemption of all amp euery man it is no better then a forgerie of mans braine there shall be many in the day of iudgement of whome christ shall say that he neuer knew them againe he saith he which beleeveth not is alreadie iudged and the wrath of god abides vpon him but if all were effectually redeemed and onely condemned for not beleeuing in christ it should haue beene said that they are alreadie iudged and that the wrath of god not abides but returnes vpon them christ makes no intercession for the worlde and therefore his redemption is not effectuall to all man for the intercession is the meanes of applying the satisfaction if it be said that by the world is meant onely contemners of grace it appeares to be otherwise in that christ opposeth the world to them which are the fathers and are gi en to christ by him thereby signifying that by the world he meanes all su h as are not the fathers and were neuer giuen to christ and he laies downe his life for his sheepe nowe the sheepe haue all these brands or markes they heare his voice they know him they follow him they shall not perish none shall plucke them out of christs hands and these are onely such of whome paul saith who shall lay any thing to the charge of god elect it is god that iustifieth who shall condemne and if this should be true that christ was crucified and died no lesse to make satisfaction for the sinnes of the damned then for the sinnes of peter and paul and the rest of the saints it followes necessarily that all their sinnes are forgiuen considering that remission of sinne depends inseparably vpon satisfaction made to god iustice for sinne and satisfaction doth necessarily abolish all fault wee graunt that christs death is sufficient to saue many thousand worlds we graunt againe it is euery way most effectuall in it selfe but that it is effectuall in or vnto the person of euery man that we denie for if it were thus effectuall then it should be applied to the person of euery man as to caine iudas nero heliogabalus ampc euen as the plaister is laide to the sore beeing applied christs righteousnes should be imputed for the iustification and sanctification of all and euery man and thus some iustified before god and sanctified should after goe to hell and be damned whereas dauid neuer so much as dreaming of this diuinitie saith that they are blessed which haue the pardon of their sinnes and paul that they which are iustified haue peace with god but let vs heare what reasons may be alleadged to iustifie the vniuersalitie of redemption i ezechiel verse as i liue saith the lord j will not the death of the vvicked but that the vvicked returne from his vvicked vvay ansvveare the place is to be vnderstoode not simplie but in respect of the twaine god rather wills the repentance of the sinner then his death againe he wils not death as it is the destruction of his creature and so this place may be vnderstoode yet neuerthelesse he will the same as it is a meanes of manifestation of his iustice and therefore the prophet isai saith that god createth euill ii tim god vvould haue all man to be saued and come to the acknovvledgement of the truth ansvveare the place is meant not of the persons of all particular man but of the orders and kindes of man for in the first verse paul exhorted timothie that praier should be made for all man and in the second verse opening his owne meaning he addeth these wordes for kings and all that be in authoritie as though he should say we must pray not onely for priuate man and for the common people but also for publicke persons though they persecute the gospell but why because in that very order god hath his elect which shall be saued and on this manner paul expoundes himselfe else where there is neither ievve nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ iii rom verse god hath shut vp all in vnbeliefe that he might haue mercie on all ansvveare the worde all must be vnderstoode of all that are to be saued both of iewes and gentiles as the article added to all importeth and the meaning is that god will saue all whome he purposeth to saue of his mercie and not of their merite because all are sinners as well iewes as gentiles thus paul expoundes himselfe galat the scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne that the promise by the faith of iesus christ should be giuen to them that beleeue and if we should expound the word all for euery particular man as some would haue paul must contradict himselfe who said before that god would haue mercie on whom he wil haue mercie amp whom he will hee hardeneth and in this very chapter his drift is to prooue the reiection of the iewes and the calling of the gentiles iv ioh god so loued the world that he hath giuen his onely begotten son that whosoeuer beleeueth in him shall not perish but haue euerlasting life and ioh i will giue my flesh for the life of the world answer by world we must no vnderstand euery particular man in the world but the elect both among the iewes and gentiles for in both these places christ doth ouerthwart the coceit of the iewes which thought that they alone were loued of god and not the gentiles and how this word is to be vnderstoode in the newe testament paul doth fully declare rom verse if saith he the fall of them that is the iewes be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles ampc and verse if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiuing be but life from the dead where by the world he vnderstads the bodie of the gentiles in the last age of the world and thus he fully declares his owne meaning when he saith to the corinthians god was in christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe v rom verse destroy not him with thy meate for whome christ died pet denying the lord that bought them and bring vpon themselues swift damnation therefore christ died for them also which are condemned answer the reason is not good for in these and such like places the scripture speakes of man not as they are indeede before god but as they are in appearance and profession and as they are in the acceptance of man for so long as a man holds and imbraces the christian faith so long in the iudgement of charitie we must esteeme him to be one that is redeemed by christ though in deede he be not and this is the meaning of peter when he saith that false prophets denie the lord that bought them vi in the preaching of the gospell grace is freely offered not onely to the elect but to all man indifferently and god in offer grace deludes no man and therefore christs death appertaines and belongs to all man indifferently answer the preaching of the gospell is an ordinance of god appointed for the gathering togither and the accomplishment of the number of the elect and therefore in the ministerie of the worde grace and saluation is offered principally and directly to the elect and onely by consequent to them which are ordained to iust damnation because they are mingled with the elect in the same societies amp because the ministers of god not knowing his secret counsell in charitie thinke all to be elect and though god in offer grace doe not conferre it to all yet is there no delusion for the offer of grace doth not only serue for the conuersion of a sinner but also to be an occasion by mens fault of blinding the minde and hardening the hearte and of taking away excuse in the day of iudgement to conclude this pointe vniuersall redemption of all man we graunt the scripture saith so and there is an universalitie among the elect and beleeuers but uniuersall redemption of all and euerie man as well the damned as the elect and that effectually we renounce as hauing neither footing in the scripture nor in the writings of any ancient and orthodoxe diuine for many hundred yeeres after christ his words not depraued and mistaken as for universall vocation it is of the same kind with the former because it is flat against the word of god in which is fully set downe a distinction of the whole world from the creation to the daies of christ into two partes one the people of god being receiued into the couenant the other being the greatest part of the world no people and forth of the couenant from the beginning of the worlde to the giuing of the lawe the church was shut up in the families of the patriarches and the couenant in the verie family of abraham was restrained to isaac and the members of these families for this cause were called the sonnes of god the rest of the world beside being tearmed as they were indeede the sonnes of man from the giuing of the lawe till christ the nation of the iewes was the church of god and the rest of the world beside no people of god and therefore esai calles them prisoners and them that are in darkenesse and ose such as are without mercie and no people and zachary such as are not ioyned to the lord and paul such as are set to walke in their owne waies beeing without god and without christ in the world and this distinction betweene iewe and gentile stoode till the verie ascension of christ and hereupon when he was to send his disciples to preach hee charged them not to goe into the way of the gentiles amp not to enter into the cities of the samaritanes but rather to goe to the lost sheepe of the house of israel amp when the woman of canaan made request for her daughter he gives a deniall at the first vpon this distinction saying it is not meete to take the childrens bread and giue it unto dogges and againe i am not sent but unto the lost sheepe of the house of israel it will be said that this distinction arose of this that the gentiles at the first fell away from the couenant and contemned the messias it is true indeede of the first heads of the gentiles the sonnes of noe but of their posterity it is false which in times folowing did not so much as heare of the couenant and the messias the prophet esai saith of christ a nation that knew not thee shall runne unto thee and paul speaking to the athenians saieth that the times of this their ignorance god regarded not but now admonisheth all man euery where to repent amp to the romans he saith that the mysterie touching christ and his benefits was kept secret since the world began amp now opened amp published among all natios and if the gentiles had but knowe of the messias why did not their poets and philosophers who in their writings notoriously abuse the iewes with sundry apella verpus recutitus sabbatarius cultor nabium nicknames at the least signifie the contempt of the redeemer wherefore to hold and much more to auouch by writing that all and euery one of the heathen were called it is most absurd and if it were so the canibals and the sauadge nation of america should haue knowen christ without preaching which by the history of the discouerie of those cuntries is knowen to be false againe if the vocation of euery man be effectuall then faith must be common to all man either by nature or by grace or both now to say the first namely that the power of beleeuing is common to all by nature is the heresie of the pelagians amp to say it is common to all by grace is false all man have not faith saith paul nay many to whom the gospell is preached doe not so much as understand it and giue assent unto it satan blinding their minds that the light of the glorious gospell of christ should not shine unto them and to say that faith is partly by nature amp partly by grace is the condemned heresie of the semi pelagian for wee can not so much as thinke a good thought of our selues the last defect in the platforme is that they ascribe unto god a wrong end of his counsels namely the communication of mercie or goodnesse in eternall happines for the absolute amp soueraigne ende of all god doings must be answerable to his nature which is not mercy and loue alone but also iustice it selfe and that is the manifestation of his glorie both in iustice and mercy by the expresse testimonie of scripture againe if this were so all man without exception should be saued because god can not be frustrated of his end amp purpose amp if but one man be damned he is daned either because god wil not saue him or because he cannot if they say he will not then he is changeable if he can not then he is not omnipotent considering his purpose was to convey happines to all creatures thus much of the efficient cause of the church namely god predestination which doctrine could not here be omitted cosidering no man can beleeue himselfe to be a meber of the church unlesse withall he beleeue that he is predestinate to life euerlasting now we come to the second point namely the mysticall vnion which is the very forme of the church whereby all rhat beleeue are made one with christ to the causing of this union things are required a donation or giuing of christ unto that man which is to be made one with him amp a coniunction betwene them both of the first the prophet esai saith vnto us a child is borne amp unto us a son is given amp paul who spared not his own son but gave him for us all how shall he not with him give vs all things also and touching it sundry points must be considered the first is what is meant by this giuing ansvvere it is an action or worke of god the father by the holy ghost whereby christ as redeemer in the appointed time is really communicated to all ordained to saluation in such manner that they may truly say that christ himselfe with all his benefites is theirs both in respect of right thereto and in respect of all fruite redounding thence and that as truly as any man may say that house and lande giuen him of his ancetours is his owne both to possesse and to use the second point is what is the verie thing giuen answer whole christ god and man is giuen because his humanitie without his godhead or the godhead without the humanitie doth not reconcile us to god yet in this giuing there must be a diverse consideration had of the two natures of christ for the communication of the godhead is meerely energeticall that is onely in respect of operation in that it doeth make the manhood personally vnited vnto it to be propitiatorie for our sinnes and meritorious of life eternall and to auouch any communication of the godhead in respect of essence were to bring in the heresie of the maniches and to maintaine a composition amp a commixtion of our natures with the nature of god againe in the manhood of christ we must distinguish betweene the subiect it selfe the substance of bodie and soule and the blessings in the subiect which tend to our saluation and the communication of the aforesaide manhoode is in respect of both without separation for no man can receiue sauing vertue from christ vnlesse first of all he receiue christ himselfe as no man can haue the treasure hid in the field unlesse first of all he haue the field and no man can be nourished by meate and drink unlesse first of all he receiue the substance of both and this is the cause why not only in the preaching of the word but also in the institution of the lordes supper expresse mention is made not only of christs merite but also of his verie body and bloode whereby the whole humanitie is signified as appeares by that place where it is said that the word was made flesh and though the flesh of it selfe profite nothing as s john saith yet as it is ioyned to the godhead of the son and doth subsist in his person it receiueth thence quickening vertue to reuiue and renewe all those to whome it shall be giuen lastly among the blessings that are stored up in the manhood of christ for our saluation some are giuen unto vs by imputation as when we are iustified by the righteousnesse indeed inherent in his manhood but imputed vnto us some by infusion as when holinesse is wrought in our hearts by the spirit as a fruite of that holinesse which is in the manhood of christ amp deriued from it as the light of one candle from another the thirde point is in what maner christ is giuen unto us ansvv god the father giueth christ unto his church not in any earthly or bodily manner as when a king bestoweth a gift with his owne hand and puttes it into the hande of his subiect but the manner is altogither celestiall and spirituall partly because it is brought to passe by the meere diuine operation of the holy ghost and partly because in respect of vs this gift is receiued by an instrument which is supernaturall namely faith whereby we lay hold of amp apply unto our selues the euangelicall promises and this maner of giuing may be conceiued thus a ma that neuer stirred foote out of england holdes and enioyes lande in turkey but how comes it to be his thus the emperour was willing and content to bestow it and the man for his part as willing to accept and receiue it and by this meanes that which at the first was the emperours by mutuall consent becomes the mans in the same manner god the father hath made an evangelical couenant with his church in which of his mercy hee ha h made a graunt of his owne son vnto us with righteousnesse and life euerlasting in him and we againe by his grace accept of this graunt and receiue the same by faith and thus by mutuall consent according to the tenour of the couenant any repentant sinner may truly say though i now haue mine abode upon earth amp christ in respect of his manhood be locally in heaue yet is he truly mine to haue amp to enioy his body is mine his blood is mine as for the giuing amp receiving of the body amp blood of christ in bodily maner which the papists maintaine in auouching the reall transubstatiatio of bread and wine in the sacraments into the body amp blood of christ and the lutheranes also in teaching that his body and bloode is substantially either in or with or under the bread and wine is an erronious conceit flat opposite to sundrie points of the christian faith for christ to this verie houre retaineth still the essence and essentiall properties of a true bodie and wee beleeue that really and visibly he ascended into heauen and there abides till his seconde comming to the last iudgement who then hauing but common reason would imagine a communication of the bodie of christ pent up in the element of bread and conveyed into our body by the mouth and stomacke the third point is whether we are not lordes of christ he being thus giuen unto us ans no for this donation is not single but mutuall as christ is giuen to us so wee againe are giuen to christ as he himselfe saith those whome thou hast given me father i have kept and wee are giuen unto him in that our body and soules are made his not onely as he is god but also as he is our redeemer and our sinnes with the guilt thereof are made his by imputation amp the punishment thereof is wholly laide upon him this is all the dowrie which the church being the spouse of christ hath brought unto him the fift point is how any man in particular may know that christ is giuen unto him of the father ans when god giues christ to man he withall giues man grace and power to receiue christ and to apprehend him with all his benefits and this we doe when wee utterly renounce our selues this world and all things therein bewaile our sinnes past resting on the death of christ for the pardon of them all and as it were with both the armes of faith catching hold vpon him in all esta es both in life and death when the heart of any man is truly disposed and inclined to doe these and the like things we may truly say that god hath giuen him grace to receiue christ the second thing required to make us one with christ is the mysticall vnion which is a coniunction whereby christ and his church are actually coupled into one whol mysticall bodie now that we may the better conceiue the nature of it sundrie questions are to be mooued the first what kinde of coniunction this is ansvver in the scripture we meete with three kind of coniunctions the first is coniunction in nature when sundry things are coupled all by one and the same nature as the father the son and the holy ghost being three distinct subsistances are all one and therefore ioyned in one godhead or diuine nature now christ and the beleeuer are not ioyned in nature for then they twaine should haue one body amp soule the second coniunction is in person when things in nature different so concurre togither that they make but one person as body and soule make one man and the godhead of the son with his manhood make but one christ in whome there is an union of distinct natures with unitie of person now christ and a christian are not ioyned in person for christ is one person peter a second and paul a third distinct from them both and so many man as there be so many seuerall persons the third coniunction is in spirit and this is the coniunction meant in this place wherby christ and his church are ioyned togither for the very same spirit of god that dwelleth in the manhood of christ and filleth it with all graces aboue measure is deriued thence and dwelleth in all the true members of the church and filleth them with the like graces in measure and therefore s john saith hereby wee know that wee dwell in him and hee in us because he hath given vs of his spirit hence it followes that the bond of this coniunction is one amp the same spirit descending from christ the head to all his members creating also in them the instrument of faith whereby they apprehend christ and make him their owne the second is what are the things united ansvv not the bodie of the beleeuer to the body of christ or the soule to his soule but the whole person of the man to the whole person of christ yet in this order wee are first of all amp immediatly ioyned to the manhoode of christ and by the manhood to the godhead the thirde question is what is the manner of this coniunction answer wee must not thinke that christ and his church are ioyned by imagination as the mind of man and the thing whereof he thinkes or by consent of heart as one friend is ioyned with another and as the iewes conuerted were all of one heart and soule or by any abode in one place or by touching as sea and land are both ioyned togither and make one globe or by any composition or commixtion of substances as when many ingredients are put togither to make one medecine but this coniunction is altogither spirituall as the former giuing was and incomprehensible to mans reason and therefore we must rather labour to feele it by experience in the heart then to conceiue it in the braine yet neuerthelesse it shall not be amisse to consider a semblance of it in this comparison suppose a man hauing the partes of his bodie disioyned farre asunder his head lying in italy one arme in germany the other in spaine and his legges with us in england suppose further all these partes or quarters haue all one soule extending it selfe unto them all and quickening ech of them seuerally as though they were nearely ioyned togither and though the partes be seuered many hundred miles asunder yet the distance of place doeth not hinder the coniunction considering one and the same soule doth inlarge it selfe and giue life vnto them all in the same maner the head of the mysticall bodie christ our sauiour is now in heauen and some of his members in heauen with him and some in earth and of these some in england some in germany some in italie some in spaine distant many thousand miles asunder and the spirit of god is as it were the soule of this body which giueth spirituall life to all the members distance of place doth not hinder this coniunction because the holy ghost which linketh all the partes togither is infinite the benefites which we receiue by this mysticall union are manifold for it is the ground of the conveiance of all grace the first that by meanes hereof every christian as he is a christian or a man regenerate hath his beginning and being in christ howsoeuer as he is a ma he hath his being amp subsisting in himselfe as paul saith ye are of god in christ and wee are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones how will some say can this be after this maner the comparison is taken from our first parentes eve was made of a rib taken out of adams side he being cast into a slumber this being done adam awaked amp said this now is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh christ was nailed on the crosse and his most pretious blood was shedde and out of it arise and spring all true christians that is out of the merite of christes death and passion whereby they become newe creatures secondly euerie one that beleeueth in christ by reason of this union hath an unspeakeable prerogatiue for hereby he is first united to christ and by reason thereof is also ioyned to the whole trinitie the father the son and the holy ghost and shall haue eternall fellowshippe with them thirdly sundrie man specially papistes deride the doctrine of iustification by imputed righteousnesse thinking it as absurd that a ma should be iust by that righteousnesse which is inherent in the person of christ as if we should say that one man may liue by the soule of another or be learned by the learning of another but here we may see that it hath sufficient foundation for there is a most nere and straite union betweene christ and all that beleeue in him and in this union christ with all his benefites according to the tenour of the couenant of grace is made ours really amp therefore we may stand iust before god by his righteousnes it being indeed his because it is in him as in a subiect yet so as it is also ours because it is giuen unto us of god now there is no such union betwene man amp ma amp for that cause one man can not liue by the soule of another or be learned by the learning of another fourthly from this fountaine springs our sanctification whereby wee die to sinne amp are renewed in righteousnes and holines wormes and flies that haue lyen dead all winter if they be laid in the sun in the spring time begin to reuiue by vertue thereof euen so when we are united to christ amp are as it were laide in the beames of thi blessed son of righteousnesse vertue is deriued thence which warmeth our benummed heartes deade in sinne and reviveth us to newenesse of life whereby we begin to affect and like good things and put in practise all the duties of religion firstly hence we haue the protection of god angels for they alwaies wait and attend on christ and because wee are made one with him they attend upon us also lastly by reason of this union with christ euery beleeuer commeth to haue interest and to recouer his title in the creatures of god and to haue the holy and lawful use of them all for we must consider that although adam created in the image of god was made lord over all things in heauen amp earth yet when he fell by ea ing the forbidden fruite he and in him all mankinde lost the title and use of them all now therefore that a man may recover his interest hee must first of all be united and made one with christ and then by christ who is lord and king ouer all shall he recouer that title in the creatures of god which hee had by creation and be made lorde ouer them againe but some will say if this be so then a christian man may haue and enioy all creatures at his pleasure and therefore the goods of other man ans the reason is not good for in this life we haue no more but jus ad rem right unto the creature amp jus in re right in it that is actuall possession is reserued for the life to come therefore wee content our selues with our allowed portions giuen unto us by god by his grace using them in holy manner expecting by hope the full fruition of all thinges till after this life againe if all title to the creatures be recouered by christ it may be demanded whether infidel haue any interest to their goods or no ans infidel before man are right lordes of all their landes and possessions which they haue obtained by lawful meanes and in the courtes of man they are not to be depriued of them but before god they are but vsurpers because they hold them not in capite that is in christ neither haue they any holy and right use of them for to the uncleane all things are vncleane and they must first of all become members of christ before they can hold amp enioy them aright amp use them wel the duties which are to be learned of the doctrine of this vnion are manifolde and first of all wee are taught to purge our handes and heartes of all our sinnes and especially to auoide all those sinnes whereby mens body are defiled as drunkennesse uncleannesse fornication for they driue away the spirit of god from his owne house and dissolue the bond of the coniunction betweene christ and vs secondly we must euery one of us which professe our selues to be members of christ labour to become conformable unto him in holinesse of life and to become new creatures for this union requireth thus much let a man take the griftes of a crabbe tree and set them into good stockes yet will they not chaunge their sappe but bring foorth fruite according to their owne nature euen sowre crabbes but it must not be so with us wee are indeed wild oliues and the braunches of wilde vines yet seeing we are perswaded that wee are grafted into christ and made one with him we must lay aside our wild and soure nature and take upon us the nature of the true vine beare good fruite haue good iuyce in us and render sweete wine thirdly wee are taught hence to be plentifull in all good workes consideriag wee are ioyned to him that is the fountaine of grace and therefore christ saieth i am the true vine and my father is the husbande man every braunch that beareth not fruite in mee hee taketh avvay and everie one that beareth fruite hee purgeth it that it may beare more fruite and the prophet esai compares the church of god to a vineyarde with a tower and a wine presse in it and god himselfe comes often downe vnto it to see the fruites of the valley to see if the vine budde and the pomegranates flourish and further wee must bring forth fruite vvith patience for the lorde of this vineyarde comes with crosses and afflictions as with a pruning knife in his hand to pare and to dresse us that wee may be fit to bring foorth fruite plentifully in duties of pietie to god and in duties of loue to all man yes to our enemy crhistian man are trees of righteousnes growing by the water of the sanctuary but what trees not like ours for they are rooted upwarde in heauen in christ and their graines and branches growe downward that they may beare fruite among man hitherto we haue heard what the church is now to beleeue the church is nothing else but to beleeue that there is a company of the predestinate made one in christ and that withall we are in the number of them before wee proceede any further three rules must be obserued touching the church in generall the first that christ alone is the head of the catholike church amp that hee neither hath nor can haue any creature in heauen or earth to be his fellow herein for the church is his body and none but he can perfourme the duty of an head unto it which dutie stands in two things the first is to gouerne the church by such power and authoritie whereby he can and doth prescribe lawes properly binding the consciences of all his members the second is by grace to quicken and put spirituall life into them so as they shall be able to say that they liue not but christ in them as for the supremacie of the sea of rome whereby the pope will needs stand ministeriall heade to the catholike church is a satanicall forgerie for the headshippe as i may tearme it of christ is of that nature or qualitie that it can admitte no deputy whether wee respect the commaunding or the quickening power of christ before nam d nay christ needes no vicar or deputy for hee is all sufficient in him selfe and alwaies present with his church as hee him selfe testifieth saying where tvvo or three are gathered togither in my name there am i in the middest among them and whereas all commissions cease in the presence of him that giues the commission it is as much pride and arrogancie for the pope to take unto himselfe the title of the heade and universall bishoppe of the church as it is for a subiect to keepe him selfe in commission in the presence of his king the seconde rule is that there is no saluation out of the church and that therefore euerie one which is to be saued must become a member amp a citizen of the catholike and apostolike church amp such as remaine for euer out of the same perish eternally therefore s john saieth they went out of us they were not of us for if they had beene of vs they woulde have remained with vs but this commeth to passe that it might appeare that they are not all of vs and againe that such as be holy are in the citie of god but without that is forth of the church are dogges inchaunters whoremongers adulterers ampc and the arke out of which all perished figured the church out of which all are condemned and for this cause saint luke saieth that the lorde added to the church from day to day such as shoulde be saved and the reason hereof is plaine for without christ there is no saluation but out of the militant church there is no christ nor faith in christ and therefore no saluation againe foorth of the militant church there are no meanes of saluation no preaching of the worde no invocation of god name no sacraments and therefore no saluation for this cause euery man must be admonished euermore to ioyne himselfe to some particular church being a sounde member of the catholike church the thirde rule is that the church which here wee beleeue is onely one as christ himselfe speaketh my dove is alone and my vndefiled is the onely daughter of her mother and as there is onely one god and one redeemer one faith one baptisme and one way of saluation by christ onely so there is but one church alone the catholicke church hath two partes the church triumphant in heauen and the church militant on earth the triumphant church may thus be described it is a company of the spirites of iust man triumphing over the flesh the devill and the vvorlde praising god first i say it is a company of the spirites of man as the holy ghost expressely tearmeth it because the soules onely of the godly departed as of abraham isaac iacob dauid ampc are as yet ascended into heauen and not their body furthermore the properties of this company are two the first is to make triumph ouer their spirituall enemy the flesh the deuill the worlde for the righteous man so long as he liues in this world is in continuall comb te without truce with all these enemy of his saluation and by constant faith obtaining victory in the ende of his life hee is translated in glorious and triumphant manner into the kingdome of glorie this was signified to john in a vision in which hee saw an innumerable company of all sorts of nation kinreds people and tongues stande before the lambe clothed in long vvhite robes with palmes in their handes in token that they haue beene warriours but now by christ haue gotten the victorie and are made conquerours their second propertie is to praise and magnifie the name of god as it followeth in the former place saying amen praise and glorie and vvisedome and thankes honour povver and might be vnto our god for evermore hence it may be demanded whether angels be of this triumphant church or no ansvvere the blessed angels be in heauen in the presence of god the father the son and the holy ghost but they are not of the mysticall bodie of christ because they are not under him as he is their redeemer considering they can not be redeemed which neuer fell and it can not be prooued that they now stande by the vertue of christs redemption but they are under him as hee is their lord and king and by the power of christ as hee is god and their god are they confirmed and therefore as i take it wee can not say that angels are members of the mysticall body of christ or of the triumphant church the church militant may be thus described it is the company of the elect or faithfull living under the crosse desiring to be remooved and to be with christ i say not that the militant church is the whole bodie of the elect but only that part thereof which liueth upon earth and the infallible marke thereof is that faith in christ which is taught and deliuered in the writings of the prophets and apostles and this faith againe may be discerned by two markes the first is that the members of this company liue vnder the crosse and profite by it in all spirituall grace and therefore it is saide that we must through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of heaven and our sauiour christ saieth if any man will come after me let him deny himselfe and take vp his crosse every day and follow me the second marke is a desire to depart hence and to be with christ as paul saith wee love rather to be removed out of this body and to be with christ and againe i desire to be loosed and to be with christ which is best of all where yet we must remember that the members of christ doe not desire death simply and absolutely but in two respectes i that they might leaue off to sinne and by sinning leaue to displease god ii that they might come to enioy happinesse in heauen and to be with christ touching the generall estate of the militant church two questions are to be considered the first how farre forth god is present with it assisting it by his grace answere god giues his spirit unto it in such a measure that although the gates of hell cannot preuaile against it yet neuerthelesse it remaines still subiect to errour both in doctrine and manners for that which is true in euerie member of the church is also true in the whole but euery member of the militant church is subiect to errour both in doctrine and manners because man in this life are but in parte enlightened and sanctified and therefore still remaine subiect to blindnesse of mind and ignorance and to the rebellion of their willes and affections whereby it comes to passe that they may easily faile either in iudgement or in practise againe that which may befall one or two particular churches may likewise befall all the particular churches vpon earth all beeing in one and the same condition but this may befall one or two particular churches to faile either in doctrine or manners the church of ephesus failed in leauing her first loue whereupon christ threatneth to remooue from her the candlesticke and the church of galatia was remooued to an other gospell from him that had called them in the grace of christ now why may not the same things befall twentie yes an hundred churches which befell these twaine lastly experience sheweth this to be true in that generall councels haue erred the counce l of nicene beeing to reforme sundrie behauiours among the bishops amp elde s would with common cosent haue forbidden mariage unto them thinking it profitable to be so unlesse paphnutius had better informed them out of the scriptures in the third councell at carthagena certaine bookes apocrypha as the booke of syrach toby and the macchabees are numbred in the canon and yet were excluded by the councell of laodicea and the saying of a divine is receiued that former councells are to be reformed and amended by the latter but papistes maintaining that the church can not erre alleadge the promise of christ how be it when he is come which is the spirite of trueth hee vvill leade you into all truth ansvver the promise is directed to the apostles who with their apostolicall authoririe had this priuiledge graunted them that in the teaching and penning of the gospell they could not erre and therefore in the councell at ierusalem they conclude thus it seemes good vnto vs and to the holy ghost and if the promise be further extended to all the church it must be understoode with a limitation that god will giue his spirit unto the members thereof to lead them into all truth so farre forth as shall be needfull for their saluation the second question is wherein standes the dignitie amp excellencie of the church ansvvere it standes in subiection and obedience vnto the will amp word of his spouse and heade christ iesus and hence it followeth that the church is not to chalenge unto her selfe authority ouer the scriptures but onely a ministerie or ministeriall service whereby shee is appointed of god to preserue and keepe to publish amp preach them and to giue testimony of them and for this cause it is called the pillar and ground of trueth the church of rome not content with this saieth further that the authoritie of the church in respect of us is aboue the authoritie of the scripture because say they we can not know scripture to be scripture but by the testimonie of the church but indeed they speake an untruth for the testimony of man that are subiect to errour can not be greater and of more force with us then the testimonie of god who cannot erre againe the church hath her beginning from the worde for there can not be a church without faith and there is no faith without the word and there is no word out of the scriptures and therefore the church in respect of vs depends on the scripture and not the scripture on the church and as the lawier which hath no further power but to expound the law is vnder the law so the church which hath authoritie onely to publish and expound the scriptures can not authorize them vnto vs but must submit her selfe vnto them and whereas it is alleadged that faith comes by hearing and this hearing is in respect of the voice of the church and that therefore faith comes by the voice of the church the answeare is that the place must be vnderstood not of that generall faith whereby we are resolued that scripture is scripture but of iustifying faith whereby we attaine vnto saluation and faith comes by hearing the voice of the church not as it is the churches voice but as it is a ministery or means to publish the word of god which is both the cause amp obiect of our beleeuing now on the contrarie we must hold that as the carpenter knowes his rule to be straight not by any other rule applied vnto it but by it selfe for casting his eye vpon it he presently discernes whether it be straight or no so we know and are resolued that scripture is scripture euen by the scripture it selfe though the church say nothing so be it we haue the spirit of discerning when we read heare and consider of the scripture and yet the testimonie of the church is not to be despised for though it breed not a perswasion in vs of the certentie of the scripture yet is it a very good inducement thereto the militant church hath many parts for as the ocean sea which is but one is deuided into parts according to the regions and country against which it lieth as into the english spanish italian sea ampc so the church dispersed ouer the face of the whole earth is deuided into other particular churches according as the country are seuerall in which it is seated as into the church of england and ireland the church of fraunce the church of germany ampc againe particular churches are in a twofold estate sometime they lie hid in persecution wanting the publicke preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments amp sometimes again they are visible carrying before the eyes of the world an open profession of the name of christ as the moone is sometime eclipsed amp sometime shineth in the full in the first estate was the church of israel in the daies of eliah when he wished to die because the people had forsaken the couenant of the lord broke down his altars slaine his prophets with the sword and he was left alone and they sought to take away his life also behold a lamentable estate when so worthie a prophet could not finde an other beside himselfe that feared god yet marke what the lord saith vnto him i haue left seuen thousand in israel euen all the knees that haue not bowed vnto baal and euery mouth that hath not kissed him againe it is said that israel had bin a long season without the true god without priest to teach and without the lawe neither must this trouble any that god should so farre forth forsake his church for when ordinarie meanes of saluation faile he then gathereth his elect by extraordinarie meanes as when the children of israel wandered in the wildernesse wanting both circumcision and the passeouer he made a supplie by manna and by the pillar of a cloude hence we haue direction to answeare the papists who demaunde of vs where our church was threescore yeares agoe before the daies of luther we say that then for the space of many hundred yeares an vniuersall apostasie ouerspread the face of the whole earth and that our church then was not visible to the worlde but lay hidde vnder the chaffe of popery and the truth of this the records of all ages manifest the second estate of the church is when it flourisheth and is visible nor that the faith and secret election of man can be seene for no man can discerne these thinges but by outward signes but because it is apparant in respect of the outwarde assemblies gathered to the preaching of the worde and the administration of the sacraments for the praise and glorie of god and their mutuall edification and the visible church may be thus described it is a mixt company of man professing the faith assembled together by the preaching of the word first of all i call it a mixt company because in it there be true beleeuers and hypocrites elect and reprobate good and badde the church is the lord field in which the enemie soweth his tares it is the corne flore in which lieth wheat and chaffe it is a bad of man in which beside those that be of valour amp courage there be white liuered souldiours and it is called a church of the better part namely the elect whereof it consisteth though they be in number fewe as for the vngodly though they be in the church yet they are no more parts of it indeed the the superfluous humour in the vains are parts of the body but to proceed how are the members of the visible church qualified and discerned the answear followeth in the definition professing the faith whereby i meane the profession of that religion which hath beene taught from the beginning and is now recorded in the writings of the prophets and apostles and this profession is a signe and marke whereby a man is declared and made manifest to be a member of the church againe because the profession of the faith is otherwhiles true and syncere and otherwhiles onely in shew therefore there be also two sorts of members of the visible church members before god and members before man a member of the church before god is he that beside the outward profession of the faith hath inwardly a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained whereby he is indeede a true member of the church members before man whome we may call reputed members are such as haue nothing els but the outward profession wanting the good conscience and the faith vnfained the reason why they are to be esteemed members of vs is because we are bound by the rule of charitie to thinke of man as they appeare vnto vs leauing secret iudgements vnto god i added in the last place that the church is gathered by the word preached to shew that the cause whereby it is begunne and continued is the word which for that cause is called the immortall seede whereby we are borne anew and milke whereby we are fedde and cherished to life euerlasting and hence it followeth necessarily that the preaching of the doctrine of the prophets and apostles ioyned with any measure of faith and obedience is an vnfallible marke of a true church indeede it is true there be three things required to the good estate of a church the preaching of the gospell the administration of the sacraments and due exequution of discipline according to the word yet if the two latter be wanting if there be preaching of the worde with obedience in the people there is for substance a true church of god for it is the banner of christ displaied vnder which all that war against the flesh the deuill the worlde must range themselues as the lord saith by the prophet isai i will lift vp my hand to the gentiles and set vp my standard vnto the people and they shall bring their sonnes in their armes and their daughters shall be carried vpon their shoulders hence it followeth that man which want the preaching of the gospell must either procure the same vnto themselues or if that cannot be because they liue in the middest of idolatrous nation as in spaine and italie it is requisite that they should ioyne themselues to those places where with libertie of conscience they may inioy this happie blessing man are not to haue their hearts glued to the honours and riches of this worlde but they should be of dauids minde and rather desire to be dorekeepers in the house of god then to dwell in the tents of vngodlinesse in the canticles the spouse of christ saith shew mercie o thou whome my soule loueth where thou feedest where thou liest at noone for why should i be as shee that turneth aside to the flockes of thy companions to whome he answeareth thus if thou knowe not o thou the fairest among woman get thee forth by the steppes of the flocke and feede thy kiddes by the tents of the shepheards that is in those places where the doctrine of righteousnes and life euerlasting by the messias is published when the shunamites child was dead shee told her husband that she would goe to the man of god to whom he answeared thus why wilt thou goe to him to day it is neither nevve moone nor sabbath day whereby is signified that when teaching was skarse in israel the people did resort to the prophets for instruction and consolation and dauid saith that the people wheresoeuer their aboad was went from strength to strength till they appeared before god in sion and oftentimes they beeing proselytes there aboad must needs be out of the precincts of iewrie thus we see what the visible church is nowe further concerning it three questions are to be skaned the first is how we may discerne whether particular man and particular churches holding errours be sound members of the catholicke church or no for the answearing of this wee must make a double distinction one of errours the other of persons that erre of errours some are destroyers of the faith some only weakners of it a destroier is that which ouerturneth any fundamentall point of religion which is of that nature that if it be denied religion it selfe is ouerturned as the deniall of the death of christ amp the immortalitie of the soule iustification by works and such like and the summe of these fundamentall points is comprised in the creede of the apostles and the decalogue a weakning errour is that the holding whereof doth not ouerturne any point in the foundation of saluation as the errour of free will and sundrie such like this distinction is made by the holy ghost who saith expressely that the doctrines of repentance and faith and baptismes and laying on of hands and the resurrection and the last iudgement are the foundation namely of religion and againe that christ is the foundation and that other doctrines consonant to the word are as gold and siluer laid thereupon secondly persons erring are of two sorts some erre of weakenes beeing carried away by others or of simple ignorance not yet beeing conuicted and informed concerning the truth some againe erre of obstinacie or affected ignorance which hauing bin admonished and conuicted still perseuere in their forged opinions this beeing said wee nowe come to the point if any man or church shall hold an errour of the lighter kinde he still remaines a member of the church of god and so must be reputed of vs as when a lutherane shall hold that images are still to be retained in the church that there is an vniuersall election of all man ampc for these and such like opinions may be maintained the foundation of saluation vnraced this which i say is flatly auouched by paul if any man saith he build on this foundation gold siluer precious stones timber hay or stubble his work shall be made manifest by the fire ampc and if any mans worke burne he shall loose but yet he shall be safe himselfe and therefore the hay and stubble of mens errours beside the foundation on which they are laide doe not debarre them from beeing christians or members of the church a man breakes downe the windowes of his house the house standes he breakes downe the roofe or the walles the house yet stands though deformed he pulls vp the foundation the house it selfe falls and ceaseth to be an house now religion which we professe is like an house or building and some points thereof are like windowes dores walls roofes and some are the foundation and the former may be battered the foundation standing againe if the errour be directly or by necessarie consequent euen in common sense against the foundation consideration must be had whether the church or partie erreth of weaknes or malice if of weaknes the partie is to be esteemed as a member of the catholicke church and thus paul writes vnto the church of galatia as to a church of god though by false teachers it had bin turned a way to another gospel and imbraced the fundamentall errour of iustification by works but when any man or church shal hold fundamentall errours in obstinacie or affected ignorance we are then not bound to repute them any loger as churches or christians but as such to whom condemnation belongs as paul sheweth by the example of iannes and iambres and as ianes and iambres saith he withstood moses so doe these also resist the truth man of corrupt mindes reprobate concerning the faith yet withall this caueat must euer be remembred that we rather condemne the errour then the person that erreth because god mercie is like a bottomlesse sea whereby he worketh what he will and when he will in the hearts of miserable sinners the second question is where at this day we may finde such visible churches as are indeede sound members of the catholick church and for the resoluing of it we are to go through all country and religions in the world and first to beginne with turkes and iewes wee are not in any wise to acknowledge their assemblies for churches because they worship not god in christ who is the heade of the church as for the assemblies of papists which haue bin a great part of the world if thereby we vnderstand company of man holding the pope for their head and beleeuing the doctrine established in the councill of trent in name they are called churches but indeed they are no true or sound members of the catholick church for both in their doctrine amp in the worship of god they race the very foundation of religion which will appeare by these three points first of all they hold iustification by works of grace auouching that they are not only iustified before god by the merit of christ but also by their owne doings which opinion flatly ouer urneth iustification by christ for as paul saith to the galatians if ye be circum ised christ profiteth you nothing that is if yee looke to be iustified by the works of the ceremoniall law yee are fallen from christ ioyne circumcision amp christ together in the matter of iustification and yee doe quite ouerthrow iustification by christ now if this be true which is the word of god that can not lie then we say to the papists if yee will needes be iustified by works of grace ye are fallen from grace the second point is that they maintaine a daily reall sacrifice of the bodie of christ in the masse for the sinnes of the quicke and dead and this is also a fundamentall heresie for christs sacrifice on the crosse must either be a perfect sacrifice or no sacrifice and if it be often iterated and repeated by the masse priest it is not perfect but imperfect the third point is that they worship the images of the trinitie and of saints departed and their breaden god which is as vile an abomination as euer was among the gentiles all beeing directly against the true meaning of the second commandement and defacing the worship of god in the very substance thereof thus then it appeares that the old church of rome is changed and is now at this day of a spouse of christ become an harlot and therefore no more a church of christ indeed then the carkasse of a deade man that weareth a liuing mans garment is a liuing man though he looke neuer so like him and whereas they pleade for themselues that they haue succession from the apostles the answeare is that succession of person is nothing without succession of doctrine which they want and we see that heretikes haue succeeded lawful ministers secondly whereas it is alleadged that in the popish assemblies the sacrament of baptisme is rightly for substance administred and that also it is a note of a church three things may be answered first that baptisme seuered from the preaching of the gospel is no more a signe of a church then the seale seuered from the indenture is of force and that is nothing circumcision was vsed in colchis yet no church amp among the samaritans amp yet no people secodly baptisme is in the assemblies of the church of rome as the purse of the true man in the hand of the thiefe amp indeed it doth no more argue them to be churches then the true mans purse argues the thiefe to be a true man for baptisme though it be in their assemblies yet doth it appertaine not vnto them but vnto an other hidden church of god which he hath in all ages gathered forth of the midst of them thirdly though they haue the outward baptisme yet they by necessarie consequent of doctrine ouerturne the inward baptisme that stands in iustification and sanctification moreouer whereas it is alledged that they maintaine the booke of the old and new testament penned by the prophets and apostles the answear is that they doe it with adding to the canon and by corrupting the natiue sense of the scriptures in the very foundation and therefore they are but as a lanthorne that shews light to others and none to it selfe fourthly it is further said that they hold the creede of the apostles and make the same confession of faith that we doe i answeare that in shew of wordes they doe so indeede but by necessarie consequents in the rest of their doctrine they ouerturne one of the natures and all the offices of christ and therewithall most of the articles of the creede and herein they deale as a father that in outward shew tenders the bodie of his child and will not abide the least blemish vpon it and yet by secret conveiances inwardly annoies the heart the braine or the liuer and so in truth destroies the same fifthly it is alledged that antichrist must sit in the temple of god that is the church therefore say some that desire an vnion between vs and the papists popish assemblies are true churches but the argument is not good for it is one thing to be in the church an other thing to be of it and antichrist is said to sit in the church not as a member thereof but as an vsurper or as the pyrate in the ship of the marchant amp hece it cannot be prooued that assemblies of papists are churches but that in them and with them there is mingled an other hidden church in the midst whereof antichrist the pope ruleth though himselfe hath no part therein lastly whereas some being no papists think their churches to be like a bodie diseased and full of soares and wounds fro the head to the foot amp the throat also cut yet so as life is still remaining we may better thinke their foule errours considered amp their worship of god which is nothing els but a mixture of iudaisme and paganisme that it is a rotten and dead corps void of spirituall life and therefore we haue seuered our selues from the church of rome vpon iust cause neither are we schismaticks in so doing but they rather because the groud amp the proper cause of the schisme is in the as for the assemblies of anabaptists libertines antinomies trit eits arrians samosa enias they are no churches of god but conspiracies of monstrous heretikes iudicially condemned in the primitiue church and againe by the malice of satan renewed and revived in this age the same we are to thinke and say of the familie of loue as for the churches of germany commonly called the churches of the lutheranes they are to be reputed of vs as the true churches of god though their augustane confession haue not satisfied the expectation of other reformed churches yet haue they all the same enemy in matter of religion and doe alike confesse the father the son and the holy ghost and of the office of the mediatour of faith and good works of the word the church and the magistrate are all of one iudgement they differ indeede from vs in the question of the sacrament but it is no sufficient cause to induce vs to hold the as no church for that there is a true or reall receiuing of the bodie and blood of christ in the lordes supper wee all agree and wee ioyntly confesse that christ is there present so farre forth that hee doth truly feede vs with his very bodie and blood to eternall life and all the controuersie lies in the manner of receiuing we contenting our selues with that spirituall receiuing which is by the hande of faith they adding therto the corporall whereby they imagine themselues to receiue christ with the hand and mouth of the bodie and though to maintaine this their opinion they be constrained to turne the ascension of christ into a dispa ition whereby his bodie being visible becomes invisible yet in the maine points we agree that christ ascended into heauen that he entred into his kingdome in our name and for vs that we are gouerned and preserued by his power and might and that whatsoeuer good thing we haue or doe proceeds wholly from the grace of his spirit indeede the opinion of the vbiquitie of the bodie of christ reviveth the condemned heresies of eutiches and nestorius and it ouerturneth by necessarie consequent most of the articles of faith but that was priuate to some man as brentius and others and was not receiued of whole churches and whereas the man were godly and learned and we are vncerten with what affection and how long they held this errour we rest our selues in condemning it leauing the persons to god againe popish transubstantiation and lutherian consubstantiation are both against the truth of the manhoode of christ yet with great difference transubstantiation is flat against an article of faith for if christs bodie be made of bread and his blood of wine which must needes be if there be a conuersion of the one into the other then was not he conceiued and borne of the virgin marie for it can not both be made of bakers breade and of the substance of the virgin againe it abolisheth the outwarde signe in the lordes supper and the and so ouerturnes the sacrament analogie betweene the signe and the thing signified but consubstantiation doth not so neither doeth it ouerturne the substance of any article of religion but onely a maine point in philosophie which is that a body doth occupy only one place at once furthermore the churches of heluetia amp savoie amp the free cities of france amp the low country amp scotland are to be reuereced as the true churches of god as their confessios make manifest and no lesse must we thinke of our owne churches in england and ireland for we hold beleeue and maintaine and preach the true faith that is the auncient doctrine of saluation by christ taught and published by the prophets and apostles as the booke of the articles of faith agreed vpon in open parliament doe fully shewe amp withal now we are and haue bin ready to testifie this our faith by venturing our liues euen in the cause of religion against foreign power and especially the spainard and hereupon all the churches in europe giue vnto vs the hand of fellowship and whereas sundrie among vs that separate and indeed excommunicate themselues giue out that there is no church in england no ministers no sacraments their peremptorie asseuerations wanting sufficient grounde are but as paper shot they alleadge that our assemblies are full of grieuous blottes and enormities ansvv the defects and corruptions of churches must be distinguished and they be either in doctrine or manners againe corruptions in doctrine must be further distinguished some of them are errours indeed but beside the foundation amp some errors directly against the foundation and these ouerturne all religion wheras the former do not now it can not be shewed that in our churches is taught any one errour that raceth the foundation and consequently annihillateth the truth of god church indeed there is controuersie among vs touching the point of ecclesiasticall regiment but marke in what manner vvee all ioyntly agree in the substance of the regiment confessing freely that there must be preaching of the word administration of the sacraments according to the institution and the vse of the power of the kaies in admonitions suspencions excommunications the difference betweene vs is onely touching the persons and the manner of putting this gouernment in exequution and therefore man on both parts though both hold not the truth in this point yet because both hold christ the foundation they still remaine brother and true members of christ as for corruptions in manners they make not a church to be no church but a badde church when as the wicked scribes and pharisies sitting in moses chaire taught the things which he had written the people are commaunded to heare them and to doe the thinges which they say not doing the thinges which they doe and whereas it is saide that we hold christ in word and denie him in deede that is answeared thus deniall of christ is double either in iudgement or in fact deniall in iudgement ioyned with obstinacie makes a christian to be no christian deniall in fact the iudgement still remaining sound makes not a man to be no christian but a badde christian when the iewes had crucified the lord of life they still remained a church if any vpon earth and notwithstanding this their fact the apostles acknowledged that the couenant amp the promises still belonged vnto them and they neuer made any separation from their synagogues till such time as they had bin sufficiently conuicted by the apostolicall ministerie that iesus christ was the true messias thus wee see where at this day we may finde the true church of god nowe i come to the third question and that is at what time a man may with good conscience make separation from a church answeare so long as a church makes no separation from christ wee must make no separation from it and when it separates from christ wee may also separate from it and therefore in tvvo cases there is vvarrant of separation the one is when the vvorshippe of god is corrupt in substance and for this we haue a commandement be not saith paul vnequally yoked with infidel for what fellowshippe hath righteousnes with vnrighteousnes or what communion hath light with darknes or what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath the beleeuer with the infidell or what agreement hath the temple of god with idoles wherefore come out from among them and separate your selues saith the lord and we haue a practise of this in the old testament when ieroboam had set vp idoles in israel then the priests and leuites came to iudah and ierusalem to serue the lorde the second is when the doctrine of religion is corrupt in substance as paul saith if any man teach otherwise and consent not to the wholesome wordes of our lord iesus christ and to the doctrine which is acdording to godlines he is puffed vp from such separate your selues a practise of this wee haue in the apostle paul who beeing in ephesus in a synagogue of the iewes spake boldly for the space of three moneths disputing and exhorting to the thinges which concerne the kingdome of god but when certen man were hardned and disobeied speaking euill of the way of god he departed from them and separated the disciples of ephesus and the like he did at rome also as for the corruptions that be in the manners of man that be of the church they are no sufficient warrant of separation vnlesse it be from priuate company as we are admonished by the apostle paul and by the examples of dauid and lot by this which hath beene saide it appeares that the practise of such as make separation from vs is very badde and scismaticall considering our churches faile not either in the substance of doctrine or in the substance of the true worship of god now to proceede in the creede the church is further set forth by certen properties and prerogatiues the properties or qualities are two holines and largenes that the church is holy it appeares by peter which cals it an holy nation and a chosen people and by saint john who calls it the holy citie and it is so called that it may be distinguished from the false church which is tearmed in scriptures the synagogue of satan and the malignant church now this holines of the church is nothing els but a created qualitie in euery true member thereof whereby the image of god which was lost by the fall of adam is againe renewed and res ored the author of it is god by his word and spirit by little and little abolishing the corruption of sinne and sanctifying vs throughout ioh verse father sanctifie them in thy truth thy word is truth and holines must be conceiued to be in the church on this manner it is perfect in the church triumphant and it is onely begunne in the church militant in this life and that for speciall cause that we might giue all glorie to god that we might not be high minded that we might worke ou saluation with feare and trembling that we might denie our selues and wholly depende vpon god hence wee learne three things first that the church of rome erreth in teaching that a wicked man yes such an one as shall neuer be saued may be a true member of the catholicke church for in reason euery man should be answearable to the qualitie and condition of the church whereof hee is a member if it be holy as it is hee must be holy also secondly we are euery one of vs as paul saith to timothie to exercise our selues vnto godlines making conscience of all our former vnholy waies endeauouring our selues to please god in the obedience of all his commaundements it is a disgrace to the holy church of god that man professing themselues to be members of it should be vnholy thirdly our dutie is to eschewe the societie of atheists drunkardes fornicatours blasphemers and all wicked and vngodly persons as paul saith be no companions of them and haue no fellowship with the vnprofitable workes of darknes and he chargeth the thessalonians that if any man among them walke inordinately they haue no company with him that he may be ashamed the largenes of the church is noted in the worde catholicke that is generall or vniuersall and it is so called for three causes for first of all it is generall in respect of time because the church hath had a beeing in all times and ages euer since the giuing of the promise to our first parents in paradise secondly it is generall in respect of the persons of man for it standes of all sortes and degrees of man high and lowe rich and pore learned and vnlearned ampc thirdly it is catholicke or vniuersall in respect of place because it hath beene gathered from all the parts of the earth specially now in the time of the new testament when our sauiour christ saith that the gospell shall be preached in the vvhole worlde to this purpose john saith in the revelation i beheld and loe a great multitude which no man could number of all nation and kinreds and peoples and tongues stoode before the throne and before the lambe cloathed vvith long vvhite robes and palmes in their handes and the church which we here professe to beleeue is called catholicke that we may distinguish it from particular churches which are not beleeued but seene with eye whereof mention is made often in the scriptures rom corinthian the church in their house and the churches of asia coloss salute nymphas and the church in his house act the church of ierusalem act the church at antioche ampc that the church is catholicke in respect of time place person it ministers matter of endelesse comfort vnto vs for hereby we see that no order degree or state of man are excluded from grace in christ vnlesse they will exclude themselues saint john saith if any man sinne we haue an advocate with the father iesus christ the righteous nowe it might be answeared it is true indeede christ is an advocate to some man but he is no advocate to me saint john therefore saith further and he is the reconciliation for our sinnes and not for our sinnes onely but for the whole world that is for all beleeuers of what condition or degree soeuer thus much of the properties of the church now follow the prerogatiues or benefits which god bestoweth on it which are in number foure the first is expressed in these wordes the communion of saints where communion signifieth that fellowshippe or societie that one hath with an other and by saints we vnderstand not dead man inrolled in the popes calender but all that are sanctified by the blood of christ whether they be liuing or dead as paul saith vnto the church of god which is at corinthus to the that are sanctified in iesus christ saints by calling and god is the god of peace in all the churches of the saints nowe if wee adde the clause i beleeue vnto these words the meaning is this i confesse and acknowledge that there is a spirituall fellowshippe and societie among all the members of christ beeing the faithfull servant and children of god and withall i beleeue that i am partaker of the same with the rest this communion hath two parts fellowship of the members with the head and of the members with themselues the communion of the members with their head is not outwarde but altogether spirituall in the conscience and for the opening of it we must consider what the church receiueth of christ and what he receiues of it the church receiues of christ foure most worthie benefits the first that christ our mediatour god and man hath truly giuen himselfe vnto vs and is become our lot and portion and withall god the father and the holy spirit in him as dauid saith iehova is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cuppe thou shalt maintaine my lotte the lines are fallen vnto me in pleasant places yes j haue a faire heritage and my flesh faileth and my heart also but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for euer the second is the right of adoption whereby all the faithfull whether in heauen or earth are actually made the children of god the benefit is wonderfull howsoeuer carnall man esteeme not of it if a man should either by election or birth or any way els be made the sone amp heire of an earthly prince he would think himselfe highly aduanced how highly then are they extolled which are made the sonnes of god himselfe the third benefit is a title and right to the righteousnes of christ in his sufferings and his fulfilling of the lawe the excellencie of it is vnspeakeable because it serues to award the greatest temptations of the deuill whe the devil replieth thus thou article a transgressour of the law of god therefore thou shalt be damned by meanes of that communion which we haue with christ we answere againe that christ suffered the curse of the law to free us from due and deserued damnation and when he further replies that seeing wee neuer fulfilled the law we can not therefore enter into heauen we answere againe that christes obedience is a fulfilling of the lawe for us and his whole righteousnesse is ours to make us stand righteous before god the fourth benefite is a right to the kingdome of heauen as christ comforting his disciples saith feare not little flocke it is your fathers pleasure to give you a kingdome and hence it is sundrie times called act coloss ephesians the inheritance and the lot of the saints furthermore for the conu iance of these benefits unto us god hath ordained the preaching of the worde and the administration of the sacraments specially the lord supper and hath commaunded the solemne and ordinarie use of them in the church and hereupon the lord supper is called the communion the cup of blessing saith paul which we blesse is it not the communion of the blood of christ amp the bread which we breake is it not the communion of the bodie of christ that is a signe and seale of the communion againe the thinges which christ receiveth of us are two our sinnes with the punishment thereof made his by application or imputation and our afflictions with all the miseries of this life which he accountes his owne amp therefore doth as it were put under his shoulder to beare the burden of them and this communion betweene christ and us is expressed in the scriptures by that blessed and heauenly bargaine in which their is mutuall exchaunge betweene christ and us he imparts unto us milke and wine without silver or money to refresh us and gold tried by the fire that wee may become rich and white raiment that we may be cloathed and eye s lve to annoint our eyes that we may see amp we for our partes returne unto him nothing but blindnesse and nakednesse and povertie and the loathsome burden of our filthie sinnes the second parte of the communion is that which the saints haue one with another and it is either of the liuing with the liuing or of the liuing vvith the dead now the communion of the liuing standes in three things i in like affection ii in the giftes of the spirit iii in the use of temporall riches for the first communion in affection is whereby all the servant of god are like affected to god to christ to their owne sinnes and each to other they are all of one nature and heart alike disposed though they be not acquainted nor haue any externall fellowshippe in the flesh as in a family children are for the most part one like another and brought up alike euen so it is in god familie which is his church the members thereof are all alike in heart and affection and the reason is because they haue one spirite to guide them all and therefore s peter saieth the multitude of them that beleeved were of one heart and of one soule neither any of them said that any thing of that which he possessed was his owne but they had all things common and the prophet esai foretelling the unitie which should be in the kingdome of christ saieth the wolfe shall dwell vvith the lambe and the leopard shall lye with the kidde and the calfe and the lyon and the fatte beast togither and a litle childe shall leade them the covve and the beare shall feede and their yong ones shall lye togither and the lyon shall eate strawe like the bullocke the sucking child shall play vpon the hole of the aspe and the wayned child shall put his hand into the cockatrice hole by these beastes are signified man that be of a wicked amp brutish nature which when they shall be brought into the kingdome of christ shall lay aside the same amp become louing gentle curteous amp all of one minde and s peter requires of the church the practise of brotherly loue and that is to carrie a tender affection to man not because they are of the same flesh but because they are ioyned in the bond of one spirit with us furthermore by reason of this that all the children of god are of one heart there followes another duty of this communion whereby they beare one the burdens of another amp when one meber of the church is grieued all are grieued when one reioyceth all reioyce as in the body when one member suffereth all suffer the second braunch of their communion is in the giftes of god spirite as loue hope feare ampc and this is shewed when one man doth employ the graces of god bestowed on him for the good and saluation of another as a candle spendeth it selfe to giue light to others so must god people spend those gifts which god hath giuen them for the benefite of their brother a christian man howsoeuer hee be the freest man upon earth yet is he servant to all man especially to the church of god to doe seruice unto the members of it by loue for the good of all and this good is procured when vvee convey the graces of god bestowed on us to our breethren and that is done fiue waies i by example ii by admonition iii by exhortation iiii by consolation v by prayer the first which is good example wee are inioyned by christ saying let your light so shine before man that they may see your good vvorkes and glorifie your father vvhich is in heauen and that our hartes might be touched with speciall care of this dutie the lord settes before us his owne blessed example saying be yee holy as i am holy and learne of me that i am meeke and lowly and paul saith be ye follovvers of me as i follovv christ and the higher man are exalted the more carefull ought they to be in giuing good example for let a man of note or estimation doe euill and hee shall presently haue many followers euill example runnes from one to another like a leprosie or infection and this christ signified when hee said that the figge tree planted in the vineyarde if it beare no fruite makes all the ground barren the second meanes of communication of the giftes of god vnto others is admonition which is an ordinance of god whereby christian man are to recouer their breethren from their sinnes a man by occasion fallen into the water is in danger of his life and the reaching of the hande by another is the meanes to saue him now euerie man when hee sinneth doeth as much as in him lieth cast his soule into the very pit of hell and wholesome admonitions are as the reaching out of the hande to recover him againe but it will peraduenture be saide how must wee proceede in admonishing of others answer we are to obserue three things the first is to search whether we that are to reprooue be faultie our selues in the same thing or no first we must take ou the beame that is in our owne eye and so we shall see clearely to put out the mote in our brothers eye ii before wee reprooue wee must be sure that the fault is committed we must not go upon heare say or likelihoods and therefore the holy ghost saith let us consider or observe one another to provoke vnto love or good workes iii before we reproove wee must in christian wisdome make choice of time and place for all times and places serue not to this purpose and therefore salomon saith it is the glory of a man to passe by an offence furthermore in the act of admonishing two things are to be obserued i a man must deliuer the words of his admonition so farre foorth as hee can out of the word of god so as the partie which is admonished may in the person of man see god himselfe to reprooue him ii his reproofe must be made with as much compassion and fellow feeling of other mens wants as may be as paul saieth if any man be fallen by occasion into any fault ye which are spirituall as chirurgians tederly set armes amp legs in ioynt restore such an one with the spirit of meekenes the third way of communicating good things to others is exhortation and it is a meanes to excite and stirre them on forwarde which doe alreadie walke in the way of godlinesse therefore the holy ghost saith exhort one another daily least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne but alas the practise of this dutie as also of the former is hard to be found among man for it is usuall in families that masters and fathers in stead of admonishing their servant and children teach them the practise of sinne in swearing blaspheming slaundering ampc and as for exhortation it is not used let a man that hath the feare of god offend neuer so little in stead of brotherly exhortation hee shall heare his profession cast in his teeth and his hearing of sermons this practise is so generall that many beginning newly to tread in the steppes of godlinesse are hereby daunted and quite driuen backe the fourth way is consolation which is a meanes appointed by god wherby one man shoulde vvith vvords of heavenly comforte refresh the soules of others afflicted with sicknesse or any other way feeling the hand of god either in body or in mind and this dutie is as little regarded as any of the former in time of mens sicknesse neighbours come in but what say they i am sorie to see you in this case i hope to see you well againe i would be sory else ampc not one of an hundred can speake a worde of comfort to the wearie but we are faultie herein for with what affection doe we beleeue the communion of saints when we our selues are as drie fountaines that doe scarse convey a drop of refreshing to others the last meanes is praier whereby god church procureth god blessings for the seuerall members thereof and they againe for the whole and herein lies a principall point of the communion of saints which ministreth notable comfort to euery christia heart for hence we may reason thus i am indeede a member of the catholike church of god and therefore though my owne prayers be weake yet my comfort is this i knowe that i am partaker of all the good praiers of all the people of god dispersed ouer the face of the whole earth my fellowe members and of all the blessings which god bestowes on them this will make us in all our troubles to say with elisha feare not for they that be with vs are more then they that be with them when the people of israel had sinned in worshipping the golden calfe the wrath of the lord was kindled amp made a breach into them as canon shott against a wall but moses the servant of god stood in the breach before the lord to turne away his wrath least hee shoulde destroy them and the prayer of moses was so effectuall that the lord said let me alone as though moses by praier had held the hand of god that he could not punish the people and some think that stevens praier for his enemy when he was stoned was a meanes of pauls conuersion and surely though the e were no other reason yet this were sufficient to mooue a man to imbrace christian religion considering that being a member of the church hee hath parte in all the praiers of the saintes through the world and of the blessings of god that come thereby the third part of this communion is in temporall things as goods and riches whereby i meane no spirituall communion doth not barr a division of temporall goods act corinthian anabaptisticall communion but that which was used in the primitiue church when they had all things common in respect of use and some solde their goods and possessions and parted them to all man as euery one had neede and by their example we are taught to be content to employ those goods which god hath bestowed on us for the good of our fellow members within the compasse of our callings and to our abilitie amp beyond our ability if need require paul saith do good to all but specially to the which are of the houshold of faith the communion of the liuing with the deade standes in two things the one is that the saintes departed in the church triumphant doe in generall pray for the church militant vpon earth de iring the finall deliuerance of all their fellow members from all their miseries and therefore in the apocalyps they crie on this manner how long lord holy and true doest not thou iudge and avenge our bloode on them that dwell on the earth i say in generall because they pray not for the particular conditions and persons of man upon earth considering they neither know nor se nor heare us neither can they tell what things are done upon earth the second is that the godly on earth doe in heart and affection converse with them in heauen desiring continually to be dissolued and to be with christ now whereas the papists do further inlarge this communion auouching that the saintes in heauen make intercession to christ for us and impart their merits vnto us amp that we againe for that cause are to invocate them amp to do unto them religious worship we dissent from being resolued that these things are but inventions of mans braine wanting warrant of the word lastly to conclude a question may be demanded how any one of us may particularly know and be assured in our selues that we haue part in this communion of saints ans s john opens this point to the full when he saieth if vvee say that we have fellowship vvith him and yet vvalke in darkenesse vve lye but if wee walke in the light as hee is light then we haue fellowship one with another and the bloode of christ purgeth vs from all our sinnes in which wordes hee makes knowledge of god will ioyned with obedience to be an infallible marke of one that is in the communion as on the contrarie ignorance of god will or disobedience or both to be tokens of one that hath neither fellowship with christ or with the true members of christ and therefore to end this point if we would haue fellowship with christ let us learn to know what sin is amp to fli fro the same as fro the bane of our soules amp to make conscience of euery evil way the duties to be learned by rhe communion of the saints are manifold and first of all if we do beleeue the fellowship which all the faithfull haue with christ amp with themselues and be resolued that we haue part therein then must we separate and withdrawe our selues from all ungodly and unlawful societies of man in the world whatsoeuer they be unlawful societies are manifold but i will only touch one which euery where annoieth religion and hindreth greatly this communion of saints amp that is when man ioyne them selues in company to passe away the time in drink gaming ampc behold a large fellowship which beareth sway in all places there is almost no towne but there is at the least one knot of such companions amp he that will not be combined vvith such loose mates he is thought to be a man of no good nature he is foisted forth of euery company he is no body amp if a man will yeeld to run riot with them in the mispending of his time amp goods he is thought to be the best fellow in the world but vvhat is done in this societie and hovv do these cupcompanions spend their time surely the greatest part of day amp night is usually spent in swearing gaming drink surfetting revelling amp railing on the ministers of the vvord amp such as professe religion to omit the enormities vvhich they procure unto themselues hereby amp this behauiour spreads it selfe like a canker ouer euery place amp it defiles both tovvne and cuntry but vve that looke for comfort by the communion of saints must not cast in our lotte vvith such a vvicked generation but separate our selues from them for undoubtedly their societie is not of god but of the deuill and they that are of this societie can not be of the holie communion of saints and surely except the magistrate by the sword or the church by the power of the kaies doe pull downe such fellowship the holy societie of god church and people must needes decay excommunication is a censure ordained of god for this end to banish them from this heauenly communion of the members of christ that liue inordinately and haue communion with man in the workes of darkenesse secondly by this we are taught that man professing the same religion must be linked in societie and converse togither in christian loue meekenesse gentlenesse amp patience as s paul taught the philippians if there be any fellowship of the spirit if there be any compassion and mercy fulfill my ioy that we may be like minded having the same love beeing of one accord and of like iudgement and againe keepe saith he the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace why marke how his reason is fe ched from this communion because there is one body one spirit even as you are called into the hope of your vocation one lorde one faith one hope one baptisme one god and father of all which is above all and in all and no doubt the same reason made dauid say all my delight is in the saints which be vpon earth thirdly euery christian man that acknowledgeth this communion must carrie about with him a fellowfeeling that is an heart touched with compassion in regard of all the miseries that befall either the whole church or any meber thereof as christ our head teacheth us by his owne exaple when he called to saul amp said saul saul why persecutest thou me giving him to understand that he is touched with the abuses done to his church as if they had directly beene done to his owne person the prophet amos reproueth the people because they dranke wine in bowles and annointed themselues with the chiefe ointments but why was it not lawful for them to doe so yes but the cause for which they are reprooved followeth no man saith he is sory for the affliction of ioseph in the middest of their delightes and pleasures they had no regard or compassion of the miseries of the poore church and servant of god elsewhere in affliction which euery man ought to shew orth in the practise of all duties of loue and therefore paul saith pray alwaies with all maner of praiers and supplications in the spirit and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplications for the saints and he highly commendeth the philippians for communicating to his afflictions and further he biddeth philemon to comfort onesimus his bowels in the lorde and s john saieth if a mans life woulde saue his neighbours soule hee must lay it downe for him if need require wee haue all of us daily occasion to practise this duty towards the afflicted members of god church in other cuntries for howsoeuer we enioy the gospell with peace yet they are under persecution for the same and so oft as wee heare report of this we should suffer our hearts to be grieued with them and pray to god for them wee must he e be admonished not to seeke our owne things but to referre the labours of our callings to the common good especially of the church whereof we are members as for them that seeke for nothing but to maintaine their owne estate and wealth and therefore in their trade use false weights and measures the ingrossing corrupting mingling of wares glosing lying smoothing swearing forswearing dissembling griping oppressing of the poore ampc they may plead for themselues what they will but in truth they neuer yet knew what the communion of saints meant lastly considering wee are all knitte into one mysticall body and haue mutuall fellowship in the same our dutie is both to redresse the faultes of our breethren and to couer them as the hande in the bodie laies the plaister upon the sore in the foote or in the legge and withall couers it loue couers the multitude of sinnes and when man disgrace their brother for their wants and blase them to the world they doe not the dutie of fellow members thus much for the first benefit bestowed on the church the second is forgivenesse of sinnes which may be thus described forgivenesse of sins is a blessing of god upon his church procured by the death amp passion of christ whereby god esteemes of sinne as no sinne or as not committed in this description i haue couched fiue points which we are seuerally to consider the first who is the authour of forgiuenesse of sinnes ansvv god whose blessing it is for sinne is onely committed against god and the violating of his lawes amp commandements are properly sinnes and the offence done to any man or creature is no more in it selfe but an offence or iniurie yes the breach of mans comandement is no sinne unlesse it doe imply withall the breach of god commandement therefore it is a prerogatiue belonging to god alone to pardon sinne and when wee are taught to say forgiue us our trespasses as wee forgive them that trespasse against vs the meaning is not that we forgiue sinnes as they are sinnes but onely as trespasses that is losses hurtes and damages done unto us by man it may be further saide god hath giuen this power and commaundement to his ministers to forgiue sinnes saying whose sinnes yee remitte they are remitted ansvvere god ministers doe not properly forgiue sinnes but onely in the name of god according to his worde pronounce to a penitent sinner that his sinnes are pardoned and forgiuen of god and therefore it is a most certaen trueth that none can forgiue sinnes but god onely it was auouched by the pharisies and not denied by christ hence it followeth that remission of sinne being once granted remaines for euer because god loue unto the elect is unchangeable and his decree concerning their saluation can not be altered the second point is to whome remission of sinnes is giuen answer to the catholike church that is to the whole company of man predestinate to saluation as esai saieth the people that dvvell therein that is in the church shall have their sinnes forgiuen and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be named a citie sought out and not forsaken and if there had bene an uniuersall remission of sinnes to all man as some doe dreame it should not here haue bin made a peculiar prerogatiue of the church the thirde point is what is the means wherby pardo of sin is procured at god hand ans the death amp passion of christ so paul saith christ dyed for our sinnes that is christ died to be a paiment amp satisfaction to god iustice for our sins and s john saith the blood of iesus christ his son clenseth vs fro all sinne and peter saith knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver amp gold fro your vaine conversation ampc but with the pretious blood of christ as of a lamb undefiled amp without spot the fourth point is after what maner sinne is forgiuen answer by an action of god whereby for the merite of christ hee esteemes and accountes sinne as no sinne or as if it had neuer beene committed therefore dauid saieth blessed is the man to whome the lorde imputeth no sinne and in esai the lorde saieth i have put avvay thy transgressions like a cloud and thy sinnes as a myst now wee know that cloudes and mystes which appeare for a time are afterwarde by the sun utterly dispersed and king hezekias when he would shewe that the lord had forgiuen him his sinnes saith god hath cast them behind his backe alluding to the maner of man who when they will not remember or regard a thing doe turne their backes upon it and micheas saieth that god doth cast all the sinnes of his people into the bottome of the sea alluding to pharao whom the lord drowned in the bottome of the redde sea and christ hath taught us to pray thus forgive vs our debtes as wee forgive our debters in which wordes is an allusion to creditours who then forgiue debts when they account that which is debt as no debt and crosse the booke hence it appeares that damnable amp vile is the opinio of the church of rome which holdeth that there is a remission of the fault without a remission of the punishment amp withall the doctrines of humane satisfactions amp indulgencies and purgatorie amp praier for the dead built upon this foundatio are of the same kind moreouer wee must remember to adde too this clause i beleeve and then the meaning is this i do not only beleeue that god doth giue pardon of sinne to his church amp people for that the verie devil beleeue but withall i beleeue the forgiuenes of mine owne particular sins hence it appeares that it was the iudgement of the primitiue church that man should beleeue the forgiuenesse of their owne sinnes by this prerogative we reape endlesse comfort for the pardon of sinne is a most wonderfull blessing and without it euery man is more miserable and wretched then the most vile creature that euer was we loathe the serpent or the toade but if a man haue not the pardon of his sinnes procured by the death and passion of christ hee is a thousand folde worse then they for when they die there is the end of their woe and miserie but when man dieth without this benefite there is the beginning of his for first in soule till the day of iudgement and then both in body and soule for euermore he shall enter into the endlesse paines and tormentes of hell in which if one shoulde continue so many thousand yeres as there are drops in the ocean sea and then be deliuered it were some ase but hauing continued so long which is an unspeakeable length of time he must remaine there as long againe and after that for euer and euer without release and therefore among all the benefits that euer were or can be thought of this is the greatest amp most pretious among all the burdens that can befall a man what is the greatest some wil say sickenesse some ignominie some pouertie some contempt but indeed among all the heauiest and the greatest is the burden of a mans owne sinnes lying upon the conscience and pressing it downe without any assurance of pardon dauid being a king had no doubt all that heart could wish and yet hee laying aside all the roialties and pleasures of his kingdome saith this one thing aboue all that he is a blessed ma that is eased of the burde of his sinnes a lazar man full of sores is vgly to the sight and we can not abide to looke upon him but no lazar is so lothsome to us as all sinners are in the sight of god amp therfore dauid counted him blessed whose sinnes were c vered it may be some will say there is no cause why a man should thus magnifie the pardon of sinne considering it is but a common benefite thus indeede man may imagine which neuer knewe vvhat sinne meant but let a man onely as it vvere but vvith the tippe of his finger haue a little feeling of the smarte of his sinnes hee shall finde his estate so fearefull that if the vvhole vvorlde were set before him on the one side and the pardon of sins on the other hee would choose the pardon of his sinne before ten thousand worldes though many drowsie protestant esteeme nothing of it yet to the touched conscience it is a treasure which when a man findes he hides it and goes home and selles all that hee hath and buyes it therefore this benefit is most excellent and for it the members of god church haue great cause to giue god thankes without ceasing the duties to be learned hence are these and first of all here comes a common fault of man to be rebuked every one will say that he beleeueth the remission of sins yet no man almost laboureth for a true amp certen persvvasion hereof in his owne conscience amp for proofe hereof propound this question to the common christian doest thou persvvade thy selfe that god giues remission of sinnes unto his church the answer will be i know and beleeue it but aske him further doest thou beleeue the pardon of thine owne sinnes and then comes in a blinde answer i haue a good hope to god ward but i can not tell i thinke no man can say so much for god saieth to no man thy sinnes are pardoned but this is to speake flat contraries to say they beleeue and they can not tell and it bewraies exceeding negligence in matters of saluation but let them that feare god or loue their owne soules health giue all diligence to make sure the remission of their owne sinnes withall avoiding hardnesse of heart and drowsinesse of spirit the most fearefull iudgements of god which euery where take place the foolish virgines went forth to meete the bridegroome with lampes in their handes as well as the wise but they neuer so much as dreamed of the horne of oile till the comming of the bridegrome so many man live in the church of god as members thereof holding up the lampe of glorious profession but in the meane season they seeke onely for the thinges of this life neuer casting how they may assure them selues in conscience touching their reconciliation with god till the day of death come secondly if we be here bound to beleeue the pardon of all our sinnes then wee must euerie day humble our selues before god and seeke pardon for our daily offences for he giues grace to the humble or contrite he f les the hungrie with good things when the rich are sent empty away when benhadad the king of syria was discomfited and ouercome by the king of israel by the counsell of his servant who tolde him that the kings of israel were mercifull man hee sent them cloathed in sackcloath with ropes about their neckes to intreate for peace and fauour now when the king saw their submission he made couenant of peace with him we by our sinnes must iustly deserue hell death and condemnation euerie day and therefore it standeth us in hand to come into the presence of god and to humble our selues before him in sackcloath and ashes craving and intreating for nothing in the worlde so much as for pardon of our sinnes and that day by day without ceasing till the lorde giue this blessed answere to our consciences that all our sinnes are put out of his remembrance we must not thinke that god putteth grace into mens heartes when they lie snurting upon their elbowes and either not use or despise the meanes but wee must first use the meanes partly by making confession of our sinnes to god and partly by crying to heauen for pardon and then when by his grace wee begin to desire grace hee giues further grace lastly if we beleeue the pardon of our sinnes then wee must chaunge the tenour and course of our liues and take heede of breaking god commaundementes by doing any of those things whereof our consciences doe accuse us and tell us that by them we haue displeased god heretofore a man that for some misdemeanour hath bene cast into prison and lyen there many yeeres winter and sommer in cold irons when he obtaines libertie hee will often bethinke himselfe of his old miserie and take heede for eue least hee fall into the same offence againe and hee which hath seene his owne sinnes and felt the smart of them and withall by god goodnes obtained assurance touching the pardon of them will neuer wittingly and willingly commit the like sinnes any more but in all things chaunge the course of his life as for such as say that they haue the pardon of their sinnes and yet liue in them still they deceiue themselues and haue no faith at all thus much for the second benefite which god bestoweth on his church namely remission of sinnes now followeth the third in these wordes the resurrection of the body in the handling wherof sundry points must be considered the first whether there be a resurrection or no this question must needs be handled because epicures and atheists in all ages and at this day some doe call this article in question now that there is a resurrection of the body after death it may be prooued by many arguments whereof i will onely touch the principall the first is taken from the worke of redemption saint john writeth that christ came to dissolue the workes of the devill which are sinne and by sinne death and hence i reason thus if sinne and death are to be dissolued utterly then the body of the faithfull which are dead in the graue must needes be made aliue otherwise death is not abolished but sinne and death must be utterly abolished therefore there shall be a resurrection secondly god had made a couenat with his church the tenor wherof is this i will be thy god amp thou shalt be my people this couenat is not for a day or an age or for a thousande yeeres or ages but it is euerlasting amp without end so as god people may say of god for euer god is our god amp likewise god will say of his church for euermore this people is my people now if god couenant be euerlasting then all the faithfull departed from the beginning of the world must be raised again to life and if god should leaue his people in the graue under death for euer how could they be called the people of god for he is a god of mercy and of life it selfe amp therefore though they abide long in the earth yet they must at length be reuiued againe this argument christ useth against the sadduces which denied the resurrection god is not the god of the dead but of the living but god is the god of abraha isaac amp iacob which are dead and therfore they must rise againe the third argument may be taken from the tenour and order of god iustice it is an especiall part of god glory to shewe forth his mercie on the godly and his iustice upon the wicked in rewarding them according to their workes as the apostle saith god will reward every man according to his workes to them that by continuance in vvell doing seeke glorie and honour and immortalitie life eternall but vnto them that disobey the trueth that be contentious and obey vnrighteousnesse shall be indignation and wrath but in this life god rewardeth not man according to their doings and therefore salomon speaking of the estate of all man in this world saith all things come alike to all and the same condition is to the iust and vniust to the good and bad to the pure and polluted to him that offereth s crifice and to him that offreth none nay which is more here the wicked flourish and the godly are afflicted the ungodly haue hearts ease and all things at will whereas the godly are oppressed and ouerwhelmed with all kinde of miseries and are as sheepe appointed for the slaughter it remaines therefore that there must needes be a generall resurrection of all man after this life that the righteous may obtaine a reward of god free mercie and the wicked utter shame and confusion but some will say it is sufficient that god doe this to the soule of euery man the body needeth not to rise againe i answer that the ungodly man doeth not worke wickednes only in his soule but his body also is an instrument thereof and the godly doe not onely practise righteousnes in their soules but in their body also the body of the wicked are the instrumentes of sinne and the body of the righteous are the weapons of righteousnesse and therefore their body must rise againe that both in bodie and soule they may receiue a rewarde according to that which they haue wrought in them the fourth argument which is also used by paul is this christ himselfe is risen and therefore all the faithfull shall rise againe for he rose not for himselfe as a priuat man but in our roome and steade and for us if the head be risen then the mebers also shal rise againe for by the same power whereby christ raised himselfe he both can amp will raise all those that be of his mysticall bodie he beeing the first fruits of them that sleepe the fifth argument is taken from expresse testimonie of scripture iob hath an excellent place for this purpose i am sure saith he that my redeemer liueth and he shall stande the last on the earth and though after my skinne wormes destroy this bodie yet j shall see god in my flesh whom i my selfe shall see and mine eies shall behold and none other for me and saint paul to the corinthians auoucheth and prooueth this point at large by sundrie arguments which i will not stand to repeat this one remembered if saith he the dead rise not againe then your faith is vaine our preaching is in vaine and the godly departed are perished the sixth argument may be taken from the order of nature which ministreth certain resemblances of the resurrection which though they be no sufficient proofes yet may they be inducements to the truth both philosophers and also divines haue written of the phoenix that first shee is consumed to ashes by the heat of the sun and that afterward of her ashes riseth a young one and on this manner is her kinde preserued againe swallowes wormes and flyes which haue lien dead in the winter season in the spring by vertue of the sun heat reuiue againe so likewise man fall in sounes and traunses beeing for a time without breath or shew of life and yet afterward come againe and to vse pauls example before the corne can grow and beare fruit it must first be cast into the ground and there rotte and if this were not seene by experience man would not beleeue it againe euery present day is as it were dead and buried in the night following and yet afterward it returns againe the next morning lastly we reade how the old prophet raised some from death and our sauiour christ raised lazarus among the rest that had lien foure daies in the graue and stanke why then should any thinke it impossible for god to raise all man to life but let vs see what reasons may be alleadged to the contrarie first it is alleadged that the resurrection of body resolued to dust and ashes is against common sense amp reason answeare it is aboue reason but not against reason for if impotent and miserable man as experience sheweth can by article euen of ashes make the most curious workemanship of glasse why may we not in reason thinke that the omnipotent and euerliuing god is able to raise mens body out of the dust secondly it is said that mens body beeing dead are turned into dust and so are mingled with the body of beast and other creatures and one mans bodie with another and that by reason of this confusion man cannot possibly rise with their own body answer howsoeuer this is impossible with man yet it is possible with god for he that in the beginning was able to create all things of nothing is much more able to make euery mans body at the resurrectio of his own matter amp to distinguish the dust of mens body from the dust of beast and the dust of one mans bodie from another the goldsmith by his article ca sunder diverse metells one fro another amp some man out of one metell can draw another why then should we thinke it vnpossible for the almightie god to do the like it may be further obiected thus a man is eaten by a wolfe the wolfe is eaten by a lyon the lyon by the foules of the ayre and the foules of the ayre eaten againe by man againe one man is eaten of another as it is vsuall among the canibals nowe the body of that man which is turned into so many substaces especially into the bodie of another man cannot rise againe amp if the one doth the other doth not ans this reason is but a cavill of mans braine for we must not think that whatsoeuer entreth into the bodie amp is turned into the substance therof must rise again amp become a part of the bodie at the day of iudgement but euery man shall then haue so much substance of his own as shal make his bodie to be entire amp perfect though another mans flesh once eaten be no part therof againe it is vrged that because flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of god therfore the body of man shall not rise againe answer by flesh amp blood is not meant the body of man simple but the body of man as they are in weaknes without glorie subiect to corruption for flesh amp blood in scripture signifies sometime the originall sinne amp corruption of nature amp sometime mans nature subiect to miseries amp infirmities or the bodie in corruption before it be glorified and so it must be vnderstoode in this place lastly it is obiected that salomon saith the condition of the children of man and the condition of beast are euen as one condition now beast rise not againe after this life amp therefore there is no resurrection of man answer in that place salomon expoundeth himselfe they are like in dying for so he saith as the one dieth so dieth the other he speaketh not of their estate after death the second point to be considered is the cause of the resurrection in mankinde we must consider two parts the elect amp the reprobate and they both shall rise againe at the day of iudgement but by diverse causes the godly haue one cause of their resurrection amp the vngodly another the cause why the godly rise again is the resurrection of christ yes it is the proper cause which procureth and effecteth their resurrection in the scripture adam amp christ are compared together amp christ is called the second adam these were two roots the first adam was the root of all makind and he conuaieth sinne amp by sinne death to all that sprang of him christ onely excepted the second adam which is the root of all the elect couaieth life both in body amp soule to all that are vnited to him amp by the vertue of his resurrection they shall rise againe after this life for looke as the power of the godhead of christ when he was dead in the graue raised his bodie the third day so shall the same power of christ his godhead conuaie it selfe vnto all the faithfull which eue in death remain vnited vnto him amp raise the vp at the last day and for this cause christ is called a quickning spirit nowe the cause why the wicked rise againe is not the vertue of christs resurrection but the vertue of god curse set downe in his word in the day that thou shalt eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill thou shalt die the death that is a double death both of bodie and soule and therefore they arise onely by the power of christ as he is a iudge that this sentence may be verified on them and that they may suffer both in bodie and soule eternall punishment in hell fire furthermore saint john setteth downe the outwarde meanes whereby the dead shalbe raised namely the voyce of christ the houre shall come saith he in which all that are in the graues shall heare his voice and they shall come forth for as he created all things by his word so at the day of iudgement by the same voice all shalbe raised againe this may be a good reason to mooue vs to heare the ministers of god reuerently for that which they teach is the very word of god and therefore we are to pray that it may be as effectuall in raising vs vp from the graue of sinne in this life as it shalbe after this life in raising vs vp from the graue of death vnto iudgement thirdly we are to consider what manner of body shal rise at the last day answeare the same body for substance this iob knew well when he said i shall see him at the last day in my flesh whome i my selfe shall see and none other for me with these same eies neuerthelesse the body of the elect shalbe altered in qualitie being made incorruptible and filled with glorie the last point to be considered is the ende why these body shall rise againe the principall ende which god intendeth is his owne glorie in the manifestation of his iustice and mercie now at the last day when all man shall be raised to iudgement by the voice of christ the godly to life and the wicked to condemnation there shall be a full manifestation both of his mercie and iustice and therefore by consequent a full manifestation of his glorie thus much for the doctrines touching the resurrection now followe the vses first it serueth wonderfully for the comfort of all christian hearts dauid speaking not onely of christ but also of himselfe saith most notably mine heart is glad my tongue reioyceth and my flesh also doth rest in hope why so for saith he thou shalt not leaue my soule in graue neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption though the daies of this life be daies of woe and miserie yet the day of the resurrection shall be vnto all the children of god a time of reioycing and felicitie and as peter saith it is the time of refreshing whosoeuer is now an hungred shall then eate and be filled with the fruit of the tree of life and whosoeuer is now naked shalbe then cloathed with the white garments dipped in the bloode of the lambe and whosoeuer is now lame shal haue all his mebers restored perfectly and as this day is ioyfull to the godly so on the contrarie it is a day of woe and miserie to the vngodly as saint john saith they that haue done euill shall come forth to the resurrection of condemnation if they might cease to liue after this life and die as the beast doth o then it would be well with them for then they might haue an ende of their miserie but the wicked must after this life rise againe to condemnation which is the accomplishment of their eternall woe and wretchednes a rufull and dolefull case to consider and yet is it the state of all vnbeleeuing and vnrepentant sinners if a man were bidden to goe to bedde that after he had slept and was risen againe he might goe to execution it would make his heart to ake within him yet this yes a thousand fold worse is the state of all impenitent sinners they must sleepe in the graue for a while and then rise againe that a second death may be inflicted vpon them in bodie and soule which is the suffering of the full wrath of god both in bodie and soule eternally this beeing so let vs imbrace the good counsell of saint peter who saith amende your liues and turne that your sinnes may be done away when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord if a man die repentant for his sinnes it is a day of refreshing but if he die in his sinnes impenitent and hard hearted it is a day of eternall horrour desperation and confusion againe if wee beleeue that our body shall rise againe after this life and stand before god at the last day of iudgement wee must daily enter into a serious consideration of this time and haue in minde that one day we must meete the lord face to face a trauailer comes into an inne hauing but a pennie in his purse he sits downe and call for all store of prouision and dainties now what is to be thought of him surely in the iudgemet of all man his behauiour bekens follie or rather madnes but why because he spends freely and hath not regard to the reckoning which must follow how foolish then and madde is the practise of euery man that liueth in his sinnes amp bathing himselfe in his pleasures in this worlde neuer bethinking how he shall meete god at the last day of iudgement amp there make reckoning for all his doings an ancient divine writes of himself that this saying ranne in his minde and sounded alwaies in his eares arise ye dead and come vnto iudgement and this ought alwaies to be souding in our eares that while we haue time we should prepare our selues to meete god at the last day thirdly if we beleeue the resurrection of the bodie we are not to weepe and mourne immoderately for our friends deceased our sauiour christ did weepe for lazarus and when stephen was stoned to death certaine man that feared god buried him and made great lamentation for him and therefore mourning is not condemned amp we must not be as stocks that are bereft of all compassion yet remember we must what saint paul saith to the thessalonians i would not brother haue you ignorant concerning those which are asleepe that ye sorrow not as others which haue no hope for the godly man properly dieth not but laies himselfe down to take a sleepe after his manifold labours in this life which beeing ended he must rise againe to ioyes euerlasting and therefore we must moderate and mingle our mourning for the deceased with this and such like comforts fourthly we are taught hence to labour and striue against the naturall feare of death for if there be a resurrection of our body after this life then death is but a passage or middle way from this life to eternall life if a begger should be commanded to put off his old ragges that he might be clo hed with rich and costly garments would he be sorie because he should stand naked a while till he were wholly bestripped of his ragges no surely well thus doth god when he calls a man to death he bids him put off his old ragges of sinne amp corruption amp be clothed with the glorious robe of christs righteousnes amp our abode in the graue is but for a space while corruption be put off this is pauls argument saying we know that when our earthly house of this tabernacle shalbe dissolued we haue a building giuen of god which is an house not made with hands but eternall in the heauens fifthly whereas the godly are subiect to manifold afflictions amp miseries both in bodie and minde in this life here they shal find a sufficient stay to quiet amp calme their minds if they consider that after this short life is ended there will insue a ioyfull resurrection iob in the extremitie of all his temptations made this the comfort to his soule that one day he should rise again in which he should enioy the glorious presence of his creator and the h ghost saith that the servant of god in the daies of antioch were racked and tormented and would not be deliuered why so because they looked for a better resurrection lastly the consideration of this point serueth to be a bridle to restrain a man from sinne amp a spurre to make him go forward in all godlines of life and conuersation s paul had hope toward god that the resurrection of the dead should be both of the iust amp vniust now what did this mooue him vnto marke herein saith he that is in this respect i endeauour my self to haue alwaies a cleare coscience towards god and towards man and let vs for our parts likewise remember the last iudgement that it may be a meanes to mooue vs so to behaue our selues in all our actions that we may keep a good conscience before god and before man and let it also be a bridle vnto vs to keepe vs backe from all manner of sinne for what is the cause why man daily defile their body amp soules with so many damnable practises without any remorse of conscience surely they neuer seriously remember the day of the resurrection after this life wherin they must stand before christ to giue an account of that which they haue done in this life whether it be good or badde thus much of the duties now marke it is further said the resurrection of the bodie if the bodie rise it must first fal here then this point is wrapped vp as a confessed truth that all man must die the first death and yet considering that the members of the church haue the pardon of their sinnes which are the cause of death it may be demaunded why they must die ansvve re vvee are to know that when they die death doth not seaze vpon the as it is in his own nature a curse for in that respect it was borne of christ vpon the crosse and that for vs but for two other causes which wee must thinke vpon as beeing speciall meanes to make a man willing to die i they must die that originall corruption may be vtterly abolished for no man liuing on earth is perfectly sanctified and originall sinne is remaining for speciall causes to the last moment of this life amp then it is abolished and not before ii the godly die that by death as by a straight gate they may passe from this vale of miserie to eternall life and thus christ by his death makes death to be no death and turnes a curse into a blessing and to proceede it is not here said the resurrection of the soule but of the bodie onely what then will some say becommeth of the soule diverse haue thought that the soules then though they doe not die yet are still kept within the bodie beeing as it were a sleepe till the last day but god word saith to the contrarie for in the revelation it is said the soules of the godly lie vnder the altar and cry how long lord iesus and in the gospel of luke dives in soule did suffer woe and torments in hell and lazarus had ioy in abrahas bosom againe some others think that mens soules after this life doe passe from one mans bodie to another and herod may seeme to haue beene of this opinion for when newes was brought him of christ he said that john baptist beeing beheaded was risen againe thinking that the soule of john baptist was put into the bodie of some other man and for proofe herof some alledge the example of nebuchadnezzar who forsaking the societie of man liued as a beast and did eate grasse like a beast and they imagine that his owne soule went out of him and that the soule of a beast entred in the roome thereof but this indeede is a fonde conceit for euen then he had the soule of a man when he liued as a beast being only stricke by the hand of god with an exceeding madnes whereby he was bereft of common reason as doth appeare by that clause in the text where it is saide that his vnderstanding or knowledge returned to him againe againe some other thinke that the soule neither dieth nor sleepeth nor passeth out of one bodie into an other but wandereth here on earth amog man amp oftetimes appeareth to this or that ma amp this is the opinion of some hereticks amp of the common people which thinke that dead man walke and for proofe hereof some alleadge the practise of the witch of endor who is said to make samuel to appeare before saul but the truth is it was not samuel in deede but onely a counterfait of him for not all the witches in the world nor all the devil in hell are able to disquiet the soules of the faithfull departed which are in the keeping of the lord without wandring from place to place for when man die in the faith their soules are immediatly translated into heauen amp there abide till the last iudgement and contrariwise if man die in their sinnes their soules goe straight to the place of eternall condemnation and there abide as in a prison as peter saith in a word when the breath goeth out of the bodie the soule of euery man goeth straight either to heaue or hel and there is no third place of aboad metioned in scripture to conclude the resurrection of the bodie is expressely mentioned in the creede to shew that there is no resurrection of the soule which neither dieth nor sleepeth but is a spirituall and inuisible substance liuing and abiding for euer as well forth of the bodie as in the same thus much of the third prerogatiue or benefit now followeth the fourth amp last in these words and life euerlasting to handle this point to the full and to open the nature of it as it deserueth is not in the power of man for both the prophet esai and saint paul say that the eye hath not seene and the eare hath not heard neither came it into mans heart to thinke of those things which god hath prepared for those that loue him again paul when he was wrapt into the third heauen saith that he saw things not to be vttered neuerthelesse we may in some part describe the same so farre forth as god in this case hath reuealed his wil vnto vs wherefore in this last prerogatiue i consider two things the first is life it selfe the second is the continuance of life noted in the word euerlasting life it selfe is that whereby any thing acteth liueth amp moueth it selfe amp it is twofold vncreated or created vncreated life is the very godhead it selfe wherby god liueth absolutely in himselfe from himselfe amp by himselfe giuing life and being to all things that liue and haue beeing amp this life is not meant here because it is not communicable to any creature created life is a qualitie in the creature and its againe twofold natural spiritual natural life is that wherby man in this world liue by meat amp drinke amp al such means as are ministred by god prouidence spirituall life is that most blessed and happie estate in which all the elect shall raigne with christ their head in the heauens after this life amp after the day of iudgemet for euer and euer and this alone is the life which in the creed we confesse and beleeue amp it consisteth in an immediate coniunctio and communion or fellowship with god himself as christ in his solemne praier to his father a litle before his death signifieth i pray not for these alone but for them also which shall beleeue in me through thy word that they all may be one as thou o father article in me amp i in thee euen that they may be one also in vs and when saint john in the revelation saith behold the tabernacle of god is with man he will dwell with them and they shal be his people and god himselfe shall be there god with them he sheweth that the very foundation of that happines which god hath prepared for his seruats stands in a societie between god amp the whereby god shall dwell with them in heauen and they againe shall there inioy his glorious presence touching this communion three points must be considered the first is in what order man shall haue fellowship with god ans this comunion shalbe first of al with christ as he is man and by reason that the manhood of christ is personally vnited to the godhead of the son it shall also be with christ as he is god and consequently with the father amp the h ghost the reason of this order is because christ though he be the author and the fountaine of eternall life as he is god yet he conuaies the same vnto vs onely in amp by his flesh or manhood yet must we not here thinke that life proceedeth from the manhood it selfe as from a cause efficient for the flesh quickneth not by any vertue fro it selfe but by the word to which it is personally vnited it beeing as it were a pipe eternally to convaie life from the the godhead vnto vs the second point is in what thing this communion consisteth ans s paul openeth this point to the very full when he saith that after christ hath subdued all things vnto him then god shall be all in all that is god himselfe immediately shalbe all good things that heart can wish to all the elect but some man may say what is not god all in all vnto vs euen in this life for whatsoeuer good things we haue they are all from him answer it is true indeed god is all in all euen in this life but how not immediately but by outwarde meanes and that also in small measure for he conuaies his goodnes amp mercie vnto vs so long as we liue on earth partly by his creatures and partly by his word and sacraments but after this life is ended all helps and outward meanes shall cease christ shall giue vp his kingdom and as he is mediatour shal cease to put in exequution the office of a priest a prophet or a king all authoritie and power shalbe abolished and therefore all callings in the three maine estates of the church the common wealth the familie shal haue an end there shalbe no more magistrate and subiect pastor amp people master and servant father and son husband and wife there shalbe no more vse of meat drinke clothing respiration physick sleepe and yet for all this the condition of man shalbe many thousand fold more blessed then euer it was for the godhead in the trinitie immediatly without all meanes shalbe all things to all the chosen people of god in the kingdome of heauen world without end this may seeme straunge to mans reason but it is the very flat truth of the worde of god saint john in the description of the heauenly hierusalem saith that there shall be no temple in it why how then shall god be worshipped marke what followeth the lorde god almightie and the lambe are the temple of it vvhereby is signified that although now we vse the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments as meanes of our fellowship with god yet when this life is ended they must all cease god and christ being instead of all these meanes vnto vs and he addes further the citie hath no neede of the sun neither of the moone to shine in it what then will some say must there be nothing but darknes not so for the glorie of god doth lighten it and the lambe is the light of it againe he saith that in the paradise of god there is the river of water of life and the tree of life bearing fruit euery moneth and that is christ and therefore we shall haue no neede of meat drinke apparell sleepe ampc but christ himselfe our head and redeemer shalbe in stead of them all vnto vs on whome all the elect shall feede and by whome both in bodie and soule they shall be preserued euermore if a man would haue glorie the father son and holy ghost shall be his glorie if a man desire wealth and pleasure god himselfe shall be wealth and pleasure vnto him and whatsoeuer else the heart of man can wish hence it appeares that this communion is most admirable and that no togue can tell nor heart conceiue the least part of it the third point is touching the benefits or prerogatiues that proceede of this communion and they are in number sixe the first is an absolute freedome from all wants in the minde there shall be no ignorance no vnbeliefe no distrust in god no ambition no envy anger nor carnall lust nor terrour in conscience or corrupt affectio in the bodie there shalbe no soare no sicknes nor paine for god shall wipe away all teares from their eyes nay then all defects or wants in bodie or soule or in both shalbe supplied and the whole man made perfect euery way the second is perfect knowledge of god in this life the church amp al the servant of god know him but in part moses would haue seene god face but he was permitted to see only his hinder parts amp as paul saith now we know in part and darkely as through a glasse in this life wee can o otherwise discerne but as an old ma through spectacles and the creatures but specially the word of god amp the sacraments are the spectacles of our mind wherin we behold his iustice mercie loue ampc amp without the we can discerne little or nothing yet after this life when that which is perfect is come and that which is imperfect is abolished we shall see god as he is to be seene not as through a glasse but face to face and we shall know him as we are knowne of his maiestie so farre forth as possibly a creature may god in deede is infinite and therefore the full knowledge of his maiestie can no more be comprehended by the vnderstanding of a creature which is finite then the sea by a spoone yet neuerthelesse god shall be knowne euery way of man so farre forth as a creature may knowe the creator now vpon this that the elect haue such fulnes of knowledge it may be demanded whether man shal know one an other after this life or no ansvveare this question is oftener mooued by such as are ignorant then by them that haue knowledge and oftentimes it is tossed in the mouthes of them that haue little religion in their hearts and therefore i answeare first man should rather haue care to seeke howe they may come to heauen then to dispute what they shall doe when they are there the common prouerb is true it is not good counting of chickins before they be hatched secondly i say that man in heauen shall know each other yes they shall know them which were neuer knowne or seene of them before in this life which may be gathered by proportion out of god word adam in his innocencie knew eue whome he had neuer seene before and gaue her a fit name so soone as shee was created and when our sauiour christ was transfigured in the mount peter knew moses and elijah whome before he had neuer seene and therefore it is like that the elect shall know each other in heauen where their knowledge amp their whol estate shalbe fully perfited but whither they shall know one an other after an earthly manner as to say this man was my father this was mine vncle this my teacher ampc the worde of god saith nothing and therefore i will be silent and must be content a while to be ignorant in this point the third prerogatiue of euerlasting blessednes is that the elect shall loue god with as perfect loue as a creature possiblie can the manner of louing god is to loue him for himselfe and the measure is to loue him without measure and both shall be found in heauen for the saints of god shall haue an actuall fruition of god himselfe and be as it were swallowed vp with a sea of his loue and wholly rauished therewith for which cause as farre as creatures can they shall loue him againe againe the loue of a thing is according to the knowledge thereof but in this life god s knowne of man onely in part and therefore is loued onely but in part but after this life whe the elect shal know god fully they shall loue him without measure and in this respect loue hath a prerogatiue aboue faith or hope howsoeuer in some respects againe they goe beyond loue the fourth prerogatiue is that the saints of god keepe a perpetuall sabbath in heauen in this life it is kept but euery seuenth day and when it is best of all sanctified it is done but in part but in heauen euery day is a sabbath as the lord saith by the prophet isai from moneth to moneth and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh shall come and worship before me and therefore the life to come shalbe spent in the perpetuall seruice of god fifthly the body of all the elect after this life in the kingdome of heauen shall be like the glorious bodie of christ so paul saith christ iesus our lord shall chage our vile body that they may be like his glorious bodie now the resemblance betweene christs bodie and ours standeth in these things as christs bodie is vncorruptible so shall our body be void of all corruption as christs bodie is immortall so ours in the kingdome of heauen shall neuer die as christs bodie is spirituall so shal ours be made spirituall as the apostle saith it is sowen a naturall bodie it is raised a spirituall bodie not because the bodie shall be changed into a spirit for it shall remaine the same in substance and that for euer but because it shall be preserued by a spirituall and divine manner for in this life it is preserued by meat drinke cloathing sleepe physicke rest and diet but afterward without all these meanes the life of the bodie shalbe continued and bodie and soule keepe together by the immediate power of god spirit for euer and euer thus the bodie of christ is now preserued in heauen and so shall the body of all the elect be after the day of iudgement furthermore as christs bodie is now a shining bodie as doth appeare by his transfiguration in the mount so in all likelihood after the resurrection the body of the elect shall be shining and bright alwaies remaining the same for substance lastly as christs bodie after it rose againe from the graue had this propertie of agilitie beside swiftnes to passe from the earth to the third heauen being in distance many thousand miles from vs and that without violence so shal the body of the saints for beeing glorified they shall be able as well to ascende vpwarde as to goe downewarde and to mooue without violence and that very swiftly the sixth and last prerogatiue is an vnspeakable and eternall ioy as dauid saith in thy presence is fulnes of ioy at thy right had there are pleasures for euermore it is said that when salomon was crowned king the people reioyced exceedingly if there were such great ioy at his coronation which was but an earthly prince what ioy then shall there be when the elect shall see the true salomon crowned with glorie in the kingdome of heauen it is saide that the wise man which came from the east to worshippe christ when they saw the starre standing ouer the place where the babe was were exceeding glad how much more shall the elect reioyce when they shall see christ not lying in a manger but crowned with immortall glorie in the kingdome of heauen wherefore this ioy of the elect after this life is most wonderfull and can not be vttered the propertie of life eternall is to be an inheritance which god bestoweth on them which are made his sonnes in christ who is the onely begotten son of the father hence it followes necessarily that in the scriptures it is called a reward not because it is deserued by our workes as the church of rome erroniously teacheth but for other causes first because life eternall is due to all that beleue by vertue of christs merit for as his righteousnes is made ours by imputation so consequently the merit thereof is also ours and by it all personall merits in our selues vtterly excluded we deserue or merit eternall happines as a reward which neuerthelesse in respect of our selues is the free and meere gift of god the second is because there is a resemblance betweene eternall life and a reward for as a reward is giuen to a workman after his worke is done so euerlasting life is giuen vnto man after the trauailes and miseries of this life are ended the degrees of life are three the first is in this life when man beeing iustified and sanctified haue peace with god many imagine that there is no eternal life till after death but they are deceiued for it begins in this world as our sauiour christ testifieth saying verily verily i say vnto you he that heareth my wordes and beleeueth him that sent me hath euerlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but hath passed from death to life this beeing so we are hence to learne a good lesson considering we looke for life euerlasting after this life we must not deceiue our selues lingring and deferring the time till the last gaspe but wee must lay the foundation of life eternall in our selues in this worlde and haue the earnest thereof laide vp in our hearts against the day of death but how is that done wee must repent vs heartily of all our sinnes and seeke to be assured in conscience that god the father of christ is our father god the son our redeemer and god the holy ghost our comforter for as christ saith this is life eternall to knowe thee the onely god and whome thou hast sent iesus christ and wee must goe further yet endeauouring to say with paul that we liue not but that christ liueth in vs which when wee can say wee haue in vs the very seede of eternall life the second degree is in the ende of this life when the bodie freed from all diseases paines and miseries is laid to rest in the earth and the soule is receiued into heauen the third is aft r the day of iudgement when bodie and soule revnited shall both be aduanced to eternall glorie againe in this thirde degree of life there be in all likelihood sundrie degrees of glorie daniel speaking of the estate of the elect after this life saieth they that be wise shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament and they that turne many to righteousnesse shall shine as the starres for evermore now wee knowe there is difference betweene the brightnesse of the firmament and the brightnesse of the starres agane there be degrees of torments in hell as a peares by the saying of christ it shall be easier for tyrus and sydon in that day then for this generation and therefore there be proportionall degrees of glorie and paul saieth there is one glory of the sun another glory of the moone another glory of the stars for one starre differeth from another in glory so is the resurrection of the dead in which words he applies the differences of excellencie that be in the creatures to set forth the differences of glorie that shall be in mens body after the resurrection furthermore if we may coniecture it may be the degrees of glorie shall be answerable to the diverse measures of giftes and graces bestowed on man in this life and according to the imployance of them to the glorie of god and edification of the church and therefore the twelue apostles who were exceedingly enriched with the giftes of the spirite and were master builders of the church of the new testament shall sit on thrones and iudge the twelue tribes of israel but it may be obiected that if there be degrees of glorie in heauen some shall want glory ansvvere not so though some haue more and some lesse yet all shall haue sufficient take sundry vessels whereof some are bigger and some lesse and cast them all into the sea some will receiue more water and some lesse and yet all shall be full and no want in any and so likewise among the saintes of god in heauen some shall haue more glorie some lesse and yet all without exception full of glorie and whereas it is alledged that all the labourers in the vineyarde receiue each of them a pennie equallie for their hire the answere is that our sauiour christ in that parable intendes not to set foorth the equalitie of celestiall glorie and what shall be the estate of the godly after this life but the verie drifte of the parable is to shew that they which are called first haue no cause to bragge or insulte ouer others which as yet are uncalled considering they may be made equall or be preferred before them thus much of life it selfe now followes the continuance thereof which the scriptures haue noted in calling it eternall or euerlasting and to this ende paul saieth that christ hath abolished death and brought not onely life but also immortalitie to light by the gospell and this verie circumstance serues greatly to commende the happinesse of the godly in that after they haue made an entrance into it they shal neuer see terme of time or end suppose the whol world were a sea and that euery thousand yeeres expired a bird must carrie away or drinke up one onely drop of it in processe of time it will come to passe that this sea though verie huge shall be dried up but yet many thousand millions of yeres must be passed before this can be done now if a man should enioy happinesse in heauen onely for the space of time in which the sea is in drying up he woulde thinke his case most happie and blessed but behold the elect shall enioy the kingdome of heauen not only for that time but when it is ended they shall enioy it as long againe and when all is done they shall be as farre from the ending of this their ioy as they were at the beginning hauing thus seene what life euerlasting is let us now come to the use of the article and first of all if wee beleeue that there is an eternall happinesse and that the same belonges unto us then wee must use this present world and all the things therin as though we used them not and whatsoeuer wee doe in this worlde yet the eyes of our mindes must be alwaies cast toward the blessed estate prepared for us in heauen as a pilgrime in a straunge lande hath alwaies his eyes towarde his iourneyes ende and is then grieued when by any meanes hee is out of the way so much wee alwaies haue our mindes and heartes set on euerlasting life and be grieued when wee are by any way hindred in the strait way that leadeth thereunto wee haue a notable patterne of this dutie set out unto us in the patriarke abraham who beeing called of god obeyed to goe out into a place which hee shoulde afterward receiue for inheritance and hee went out not knowing whither hee went and by faith aboade in the lande of canaan as in a straunge cuntrey and as one that dvvelt in tentes now the cause that mooued him was life euerlasting for the text saith hee looked for a citie having a foundation whose builder and maker is god and wee ought euerie one of us for our partes to be like affected to all the things of this life neuer setting our hearts upon them but using them as a pilgrime doth his staffe in the way so long as it is an helpe and stay for him in his iourney hee is content to carrie it in his hande but so soone as it beginneth to trouble him he casteth it away secondly all that professe the gospell of christ may hence learne to beare the crosses and afflictions which god shall lay on them in this worlde it is god usuall manner to begin corrections in his owne family upon his owne children and as peter saieth iudgement beginneth at god house looke as a mother that waines her childe layeth wormewoode or some other bitter thing vpon her brest to make the childe loathe the milke so likewise god makes vs often feele the miseries and crosses of this life that our loue and liking might be turned from this worlde and fixed in heauen as raw flesh is loathsome to the stomacke so is euerie sinner and unmortified man loathsome unto god till the lorde by afflictions mortifie in him the corruptions of his nature and specially the loue of this worlde but when a man is afflicted how shall hee be able to endure the crosse surely by resoluing himselfe that the lorde hath prepared life euerlasting for him thus wee reade that moses by faith when he was come to age refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter and choosed rather to suffer adversitie vvith the people of god then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season esteeming the rebuke of christ greater riches then the treasures of egypt but i pray you what mooued moses to be of this minde the reason is added because he had respect to the recompence of reward that is he had alwaies a speciall regard to life euerlasting amp that was it that made him content and willing to suffer affliction with god people in the land of goshen here then behold a notable president for us to follow in which wee are taught that the best way to indure afflictions with patience is to haue an eye to the recompence of reward this is it that makes the yoke of christ easie and lightsome when it shall please god to bring unto us a cup of affliction and bid us drinke a draught thereof to the verie bottom the meditation of life eternall must be as sugar in our pockets to sweeten the cup withall lastly if this be true that god of his goodnesse amp endlesse mercie towardes mankind hath prepared life euerlasting yet not for all man but for the elect whose names are written in the booke of life we must aboue all thinges in this world seeke to be partakers of the same let us receiue this as from the lorde and lay it to our hearts whatsoeuer we doe euening or morning day or night whether we be young or old rich or poore first we must seeke for the kingdome of heauen and his righteousnesse if this benefit were common to all and not proper to the church lesse care might be had but seeing it is proper to some alone for this verie cause let all our studies be to obtaine the beginnings of life euerlasting euen in this life for if we haue it not whosoeuer wee be it had bene better for us that we had neuer bene borne or that we had bene borne dogges and toades then man for when they die there is an end of their miserie but man if hee loose everlasting happinesse hath ten thousand millions of yeeres to liue in miserie and in the torments of hell and when that time is ended hee is as farre from the ende of his miserie as hee was at the beginning wherefore i pray you let not the deuill steale this meditation out of your hearts but be carefull to repent of all your sinnes and to beleeue in christ for the pardon of them all that by this meanes yee may come to haue the pawne and earnest of the spirite concerning life euerlasting euen in this world what a miserable thing is it that man should liue long in this world and not so much as dreame of another life till the last gaspe but we must not suffer satan thus to abuse and bewitch vs for if we haue not eternall life in this world we shall neuer haue it hitherto by god goodnesse i haue shewed the meaning of the creede now to drawe to a conclusion the generall vses which are to be made of it follow and first of all we learne by it that the church of rome hath no cause to condemne us for heretikes for we doe truly hold and beleeue the whole apostolicall symbole or creed which is an epitome of the scriptures and the verie keie of faith it will be said that we denie the popes supremacie iustification by workes purgatorie the sacrifice of the masse for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead the invocation and intercession of saintes ampc which are the greatest pointes of religion it is true indeed we denie and renounce them as doctrines of devil perswading our selues that if they indeed had beene apostolicall and the verie grounds and pillars of religion as they are now auouched to be they should in no wise haue bin left forth of the creed for it is an ouersight in making a confession of faith to omit the principall points and rules of faith it will be further saide that in the creed we beleeue the church amp so consequetly are to beleeue all these former points which are taught and avouched by the church but this defence is foolish for it takes this for graunted that the church of rome is the church here ment which we denie unlesse they can proue a particular church to be vniversall or catholicke nay i adde further that the principall grounds of popish faith for which they contend with us as for life and death are not mentioned in any other creedes which were made by the churches amp councels for many hundred yeres after christ secondly the creed serues as a storehouse of remedies against all troubles amp temptations whatsoeuer i if a man be grieued for the losse of earthly riches let him consider that he beleeues god to be his creatour who will therfore guide and preserue his owne workemanship amp by his prouidece minister all things needfull unto it and that he hath not lost the principall blessing of all in that he hath god to be his father christ to be his redeemer amp the h ghost to be his comforter and that considering he lookes for life eternall he is not to be ouermuch carefull for this life amp that christ being our lord will not forsake us being the seruats in his own house but will prouide things needfull for us ii if any man be grieued in respect of outward disgrace and contempt let him remember that he beleeues in christ crucified and that therefore hee is to reioyce in contempt for righteousnesse sake iii they which are troubled for the decease of friends are to comfort themselues in the comunion of saints and that they haue god the father amp christ and the holy ghost for their friends iiii against bodily captivitie let man consider that they beleeue in christ their lord whose seruice is perfect libertie v against the feare of bodily diseases we must remember the resurrection of the bodie in which all diseases and infirmities shalbe abolished vi if a man feare the death of the body let him consider that hee beleeues in christ which died vpon the crosse who by death hath vanquished death vii the feare of persecution is restrained if we call to remembrance that god is a father almightie not onely able but also willing to represse the power of the adversarie so farre forth as shall be for the good of his children viii terrours arising of the consideration of the last iudgement are delayed by remembrance of this that christ shall be our iudge who is our redeemer ix feare of damnation is remedied by cosideration that christ died to make satisfaction for us and now sits at the right hand of his father to make intercession for us amp by the resurrection of the body to life euerlasting x terrours of conscience for sinne are repressed if we consider that god is a father and therefore much in sparing amp that it is a prerogative of the church to haue remission of sinnes

in the former part of this chapter moses hath faithfully related the drying of the water after the stood and noahs sacrificing vnto god with god acceptance thereof now in this verse and the next he recordeth such lawes and decrees as god made with noah touching the restoration of nature perished by the flood as well for the sparing of the creatures from such like destruction as for the continuance of his prouidence in needefull times and seasons meete for their future preseruation these wordes containe the first of these lawes wherein we may obserue three points moses his preface to this law the law it selfe and the reason thereof i the preface and the lord said in his heart these words must not be taken properly for god hath not an heart as man hath neither speaketh he as man doth but hereby is meant that god determined and set downe with himselfe this law and decree in this phrase of speech note this one thing if it had pleased him god could haue spoken to man by a voice the hearing whereof would haue confounded him but as here we see he doth abase himselfe and as it were lay aside his honour and might and speaketh vnto vs after the manner of man euen to the capacitie of the most simple which teacheth vs that it is the good will and pleasure of god that not onely the learned but euen the vnlettered and most ignorant should knowe and vnderstand the holy scripture for els he would neuer haue penned them in a phrase amp style that doth so well accord to the capacitie of the simple ii point the decree it selfe i will henceforth curse the ground no more for mans cause this is the peremptorie lawe of god touching the restoration of nature wherein are contained two things first what god hath done secondly what god will not doe hereafter the thing that god hath done is the cursing of the earth for he saith i will curse no more implying that he once cursed it in this obserue that god may truly be said to be a cause of curses and to curse his creatures not onely for that he doth ordaine and decree all curses but also because he inflicteth them vpon the creatures yet so as the same is alwaies most iustly deserued by sinne before it be inflicted of the lord and so must god cursing of the earth be vnderstood in this place as a fruit of his wrath for the sinne of man accordingly god is said directly to isa create euill because whatsoeuer afflictions curses and punishments are in the world they are ordained and inflicted by god vpon the creatures for the sinne of man this plainly confuteth the common opinion of ignorant people who hold that all good things as peace wealth ioy and felicitie come from god but all euill as affliction calamitie curses amp iudgements come from the deuill and god onely suffereth the this is a most erroneous and blind conceipt which filleth many a soule with much anguish and impatience for what comfort can he haue in the time of trouble that is perswaded it commeth wholly from the deuill and the hand of god is not therein we therefore must learne to reforme this opinion and know that crosses and troubles come from god this dauid knew well and therefore when shemi cursed him and railed on him he forbad ab shai to touch him because saith he sam what if or it may be god hath bid him curse dauid so ioseph telleth his brother who most traiterously sold him into egypt that gen the lord sent him before them secondly here consider the impulsiue cause that moued god to curse the earth by a flood it was not in the earth but in man i wil henceforth curse the earth no more for man that is for mans sinnes in the newe testament there are two especiall sinnes recorded for which god sent this curse first carnall securitie they were choaked with worldly cares and drowned in earthly pleasures in the daies of noah they did eat and drinke marrie and giue in marriage matth secondly the contempt of the gospell in the ministerie of noah who preached an hundred and twentie yeares vnto them while the arke was in building but they were disobedient as pet s peter saith following their owne pleasures and delights whereby it appeares that these two sinnes securitie and contempt of the gospel are most grieuous sinnes for these brought destruction not onely vpon all mankind noah and his familie excepted but euen vpon all creatures that liued by breath now looke as these sinnes were in the old world euen so are they rife in this last age according to the prophecie of our sauiour christ luke as it was in the daies of noah so shall it bee in the daies of the son of man and as this is the state of the whole world so it is the state of this our church most man are drowned in the pleasures of this world amp choked with the cares thereof for howsoeuer they will heare the gospell preached yet few apply their hearts to beleeue the same shewing forth the power therof by repentace fro dead works amp amendment of life in new obedience but we must know that if these two sins brought a curse euen destruction vpon the old world then no doubt they will bring a fearfull curse vpon this age though not by water yet some other way that shall countervaile the flood and therefore we must lay these things to our hearts that vnles we abandon securitie and worldly lustes and withall doe repent and beleeue at the preaching of the gospell we shall see that god heauie curse will fall vpon vs for if we match the old world in sinne wee must not looke to come behinde them in iudgements the second thing in this decree is what god will not doe hereafter namely curse the earth any more this must be vnderstood of that particular curse which the lord laide on the earth by water when he drowned the world for the generall curses that were laid vpo the ground and on mankind for adams sinne remaine still and shall not be taken quite away till the end of the world so that the meaning of this lawe is that the lord will no more drowne the whole earth for the sinne of man by a flood here then wee see the cause why the sea being as raging and stirring as euer it was doth notwithstanding keepe it selfe within it boundes and not ouerflow the world and why the clowdes beeing as full of water as euer they were doe not powre downe more floods vpon the earth to destroy it surely it is by vertue of this particular lawe and decree of god whereunto the sea and clowds become obedient i will henceforth curse the earth no more and here we haue iust occasion to take knowledge and veiw of our owne wretched and damnable estate how we are sold vnder sinne for howsoeuer we were created blessed and happie yet by our fall in adam we are become far worse then any earthly creature for each creature in his kind as the sun the moone and starres the sea amp cloudes amp all other obey the commandement of god but man of all creatures hauing lawes giuen him of god to keepe rebelleth in breaking the same and to him it is meate and drinke by nature to liue in the transgression of god commandements thus by comparing our selues with the brute creatures we may learne to humble our selues and to be abashed when we see them which were made to serue vs to goe before vs in obedience to the lawes of our creator iii point the reason of god decree in these words for the imagination of mans heart is evil euen from his youth at the first this reason may seeme very strange that god should no more curse the earth for man because the imagination of his heart is euill in all likelihood god should haue saide the contrarie i will still curse the earth because the imaginations of mans heart are euill for so he saith chap verse that seeing all the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart were onely euill continually therefore hee would destroy the man from the earth and from man to beast amp euery creeping thing howe can both these stand together ans thus in the sixt chapter the lord saith he wil once destroy the world by water because of the wickednes of the imaginations of man heart and here he saith he will not proceed to curse the earth againe and againe by the same punishment because the imaginations of mans heart are euill euen from his youth as if hee should say i haue once drowned the worlde for the wickednes of mans inventions but if i should thus proceede to deale with man according to the wicked imagination of his heart i must bring euery yeare a new flood vpo the earth because i see the frame of mans heart is euill continually here then obserue that god in the preseruation of mankind doth temper and moderate his iustice by mercie for if he should deale according to mans deserts hee should euery day bring curses vpon him yes so soone as a man is borne hee should be destroyed but god dealeth not so rigorously hee mingleth mercy with iustice whereby the whole frame of heauen and earth the state of man and all societies doe stand that which habacuke prayed for hab in iustice or wrath remember mercie the lord hath performed euer since the flood yes since the fall of adam there bee three great and weightie causes which mooued god to temper iustice with mercie for the preseruation of mankinde and other creatures first that hereby hee might shew his patience amp long suffering towards the vessells of wrath as the apostle rom speaketh that is towards such as will not repent that at the last day they may bee most iustly condemned secondly that there may bee a company of man vpon earth which may worshipe god for god hath speciall care of his owne glorie among man and therefore tempers iustice with mercie in their preseruation that they might glorifie him psalm verse there is mercie or pardon with thee that thou maist bee feared that is wheras oh lord thou mightest in iustice throwe all man to hell suddenly yet in mercie thou pardonest the sinnes of some for this end that they might worship thee feare being put for worship and obedience thirdly and principally that the elect and chosen of god might bee gathered for god in his eternall counsell and decree hath appointed and set downe a certaine number of man vnto whom hee will giue eternall life and for their cause doth hee spare the whole worlde from daylie destruction but when that number shall bee accomplished then shall heauen and earth goe together and the worlde shall bee no more and here by the way this third cause of the continuance of nature must teach vs our dutie to wit that seeing it pleaseth god in mercie to giue vs liberty to liue a space of time in this worlde some twentie some thirtie ome fourtie or fiftie yeares and that for this ende that heerein wee might bee fitted for his kingdome when as in the rigour of his iustice hee might haue cast vs to hell in our mothers wombe or so soone as we were borne wee therefore must bee carefull not to despise this long suffering amp patience of god but rather labour in the feare of god that it may become pet salvation vnto vs by our conscionable endeauour in all such meanes vnto the ende as hee hath sanctified for the working of the graces of life in the hearts of his children and thus much for the reason in generall that wee may the better perceiue in this reason the state of man in respect of his naturall imaginations the words are more particularly to be vnfolded for the imaginations of mans heart ampc the heart in scripture is taken sundrie waies sometimes for that fleshie part of man in the middle of the bodie which is the fountaine of vitall blood sometime for the soule of man sometime for the faculties of the soule and sometime for the middle of any thing as psalm the heart of the sea mat the heart of the earth that is the middle thereof heere it is taken for the vnderstanding facultie of the soule whereby man vseth reason which s paule calleth ephesians the spirit of the minde by imaginations hee meaneth the frame or framing of the heart and this is taken two waies of some for the naturall disposition of the vnderstanding after the fall of man of others for that which the minde and vnderstanding by thinking frameth plotteth and deuiseth that is for the effect thereof wee may take it both waies yet i rather approoue the latter for chap the lord saith hee wil once destroy all flesh and giueth this reason for the frame and thought of mans heart is euill continually where by thoughtes or imaginations can nothing else bee meant but that which is deuised and plotted in the thoughtes of mans heart so salomon speaking of an heart which god hateth saith it is framing or thinking thoughtes of wickednes prov by mans heart we must not vnderstand the heart of some particular persons as of those that liued in the old world alone but of all man generally man beeing put for whole mankind is euill that is it imagineth and thinketh that which is against the lawe of god from his childhood that is so soone as he beginneth to thinke to reason or conceiue of any thing so soone doth hee imagine amp conceiue that which is euill so that the whole meaning is this the minde amp vnderstanding part of man is naturally so corrupt that so soone as he can vse reason he doth nothing but imagine that which is wicked and against the lawe of god the words thus explaned containe in them two maine points touching the frame of mans heart by nature the first is this the imagination and conceite of euery man is naturally euill this appeareth not onely in this place but else where rom the wisdome of the flesh is not an enemie but emnitie against god againe such as the fountaine is such are the streames that flowe thence but our minde and vnderstanding the fountaine of our thoughts is by nature sinfull tit to the impure their mindes and consciences are defiled and againe corinthian of our selues we are not able to thinke a good thought and therefore the thoughtes that come from thence must needes also bee corrupt mans imagination stands in thoughts the vnderstanding deviseth by thinking and these thoughts of the imagination are all naturally wicked math from the heart saith christ proceede evill thoughts and salomon saith the thoughts of the wicked as all man are by nature are an abhom nation to the lord seeing that naturall imagination is practised by euill thoughtes wee must something consider of the naturall thoughts of man and herein handle these two poynts f rst whether the thoughtes of man may bee knowne secondly what the naturall thoughts of man be for the first there are two waies to knowe mans thoughts either directly without meanes or indirectly by meanes the first way is proper to god alone for no creature in heauen or earth can immediately and directly know the thoughts of man this salomon confesseth in his notable praier to god king thou onely knowest the thoughts of all the children of man ierem the heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things who can know it ver i the lord search the heart and trie thereines the second way to knowe mens thoughts is indirectly and by meanes which be three by instinct from god by reuelation from the scripture and by signes first by an extraordinarie instinct so did king elisha disclose the king of syrias counsell to the king of israell and by the same meanes he tolde his servant king gehezi what he did behind his back when he tooke gifts of naaman the assirian and so did act peter tell ananias and saphyra of their false conueyances with the money that they tooke for their possession and yet here we must vnderstand that when god reuealed these secret thoughts to man it was onely in some things at some times and for some speciall causes wherevpon nathan was faine to reuoke his counsell which hee gaue to dauid for the building of the house of god chronicle when he knew the will of god more perfectly and so was elijah deceiued when he said he was left alone of all israel that serued god for king god told him hee had reserued seuen thousand that neuer bowed the knee to baal which elijah knew not secondly mens thoughts may be known by revelation from scripture for therin that spirit speaketh euidently which knoweth the frame of the heart and hence it is that in the ministerie of this word the thoughts of naturall man are made manifest corint thirdly mans thoughts are knowne by signes as speeches and actions thus peter knew the act heart of simon magus and paul the heart act of elimas and thus may any ma know the thoughts of another eue as he may know the tree by his fruit and the fountain by his streame besides these three are two other meanes added whereby to know mens thoughts one by the papists and an other by the astrologians the papists say the saints in heaue know mens thoughts not directly of them selues but by reflectio in the glasse of the trintie but this is a meere forgery of their own which isaia neuer knew saying thus of the saints departed isa abraham is ignorant of vs and israel knoweth vs not but thou lord article our redeemer and the saints vnder the altar crie reverand how long lord how long wilt thou not iudge and auenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth giuing vs to vnderstand that they are not so sharpe sighted as by the glasse of the trinitie to see into the day of the last iudgement and therfore not into the thoughts of mens hearts so that there are onely three waies to know the thoughts of man and so they may be knowne hauing found that the thoughts of man may be knowne we come now to see what be the naturall cogitations of euerie sinfull man although they be almost infinite in themselues yet they may be reduced to three heads they either concern god or a mans neighbour or els a mans owne selfe of this thought there is no god touching god there be in man foure capitall euill thoughts first that there is no god which as it is first in order so it is the most notorious and vile damnable thought that can be in a naturall man and that this is one of the thoughts of man naturally appeareth by the expresse testimonie of god himselfe who knoweth the thoughts of man better then man doth psalm the wicked thinketh alwaies there is no god and againe psalm the foole hath said in his heart there is no god touching this thought obserue these foure points first in whome it is secondly how a man by thinking should denie god thirdly what is the fruit of this thought and fourthly the examination of our hearts touching this thought for the first we must not thinke that this wicked thought is onely in some notorious and hainous sinners but it is in the corrupt minde and imagination of euery man that commeth of ada naturally not one excepted saue christ alone so the foole of whome david psalm speaketh must be taken not for some speciall sinner but for euery man that liueth vncalled amp without repentance how ciuill so euer his life be other waies though some shame restraine his tongue from vttering it yet by nature his corrupt heart is prone to thinke there is no god this is made euidet by s paul rom who going about to prooue that al man are sinners by nature aleadgeth for his proofe diverse testimonies of scripture and particularly out of these two psalmes before cited whereby he giues vs to vnderstand that the foole there mentioned must be vnderstood of euery naturall man but it will be said that it is ingrafted in mans nature to hold and thinke there is a god amp therefore euery man doth not denie god in his heart ans we must know that these two thoughts there is a god and there is no god may be and are both in one and the same heart the same ma that by the light of nature thinketh there is a god may by that corruption amp darkenes of mind that came by adams fall thinke there is no god for two contraries beeing not in the highest degre may be in one and the same subiect as light and darkenesse in the same house heate and cold in the same body ii point howe doth a man by thinking denie god in his heart ans two waies first by turning the true god into an idol of mans braine secondly by placing somewhat that is not god in the roome of the true god for the first the imagination of euery man naturally without further light from the word of god doth turne the true god into an idoll and therefore paul saith of the galatians that before their vocation gal they did seruice to them which were no god and of the ephesians that ephesians they were without god in the world euen because they did not in their mindes conceiue of god aright and accordingly worship him though the wiser sort amongst them did acknowledge one god the creator of heauen and earth and therefore david saith plainely that psalm all the god of the gentiles are idols or vanities nay as the apostle saith deuills corinthian that which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice vnto deuills amp not vnto god now mans mind turneth the true god into an idoll by three notorious thoughts which are the roote of many damnable sinnes in this life first by thinking that god is not present in all places whereby god is robbed of his attribute of omni presece for the true god being infinite must be in all places which when the heart of man denieth it imagineth god to be such a one as he is not amp so turneth him into an idoll and that man naturally thinketh thus of god the scripture is plain iob wicked man are brought in speaking of god as though he were shut vp in heauen amp had nothing to do in the world is not god on high in the heauen and behold the height of the starres how high they are how should god know can he iudge ampc so the psalmist expresseth the thoughts of the wicked in their practise of sinne god hideth away his face amp wil neuer see amp the lord shall not see psalm yes they who seeke the deepe to hide their counsell from the lorde whose workes are in darkenes say who seeth vs who knoweth vs isay secondly by thinking there is no prouidence of god whereby hee ordereth and disposeth all thinges in the world particularly that this is an other naturall thought the psalmist sheweth plainly bringing in the wicked man saying thus of god god hath forgotten he hideth his face and he shall not see and the prophet zephanie bringeth in the sinner speaking thus of god that he doth neither good nor euill thirdly by thinking there is no iustice in god this is done when man imagin with themselues that albeit they proceede in the practise of sinne yet god will not punish them according to the threatning of his word if we doubt whether such an imagination be in mans heart read deut where moses directly forbiddeth the people to say in their hearts i shall haue peace though i walke in the stubbornes of my heart this is that psalm blessing of a mans selfe in sinne which dauid chargeth vpon the couetous and wicked thus they sinne that amos amos put far away the evill day and say the euill shall not come hereby god is robbed of his iustice and made a god all of mercie such a one as will not punish sinne and so indeed is made an idoll of mans brain the second way whereby a man denyeth god in thought is by placing in the roome of the true god an idoll of his owne braine this man doe by thinking some other thing beside the true god to bee their chiefest good thus voluptuous man make philipp their bellie their god and couetous man make coloss riches their god by placing their felicitie in pleasure and in riches for looke what a man thinketh to bee the best thing in the worlde for him that is his god though it bee the devill himselfe or any other creature and for this cause is the devill called the god of the world because the man of this world iudge their owne courses wherin they serue the deuill the best thing in the worlde for them yes farre better then the seruice of god amp therfore giue their hearts thereto for affection followeth opinion amp that which a man affecteth most hee must needes thinke best of and therefore what a man affecteth most that maketh hee to become his god so that iudging other things beside the true god to be best for him he must needs place the in the roome of the true god amp so in his imagination donie god iii point what is the fruite of this thought for thereby wee shall best iudge what a cursed thing this is to thinke there is no god this thought bringeth forth the most notorious sins that can be eue atheisme it selfe which is a sinne whereby man sundrie waies deny god and it is two fold either in practise or in iudgement atheisme in practise is that sinne wherby man deny god in their deedes liues and conversations amp so declare this thought this is a most horrible sinne and a huge burthen to the whole earth and yet many that liue in the bosome of the church are fouly tainted heerewith this atheisme in practise hath three speciall branches hypocrisie epicurisme and witchcraft hypocrisie is a sinne whereby man worship the true god but yet in a false manner giving vnto god the outwarde action and hold backe from him the true worship of the heart epicurisme is a sinne wherby man contemne god and giue themselues wholie to their pleasures spending their time in eating drink and other delightes and not seeking or fearing god and this is the sinne of the richer sort in this age witchcraft or magicke is that sinne wherby man renounce the true god and betake themselues to the aide counsell amp helpe of the deuill either by himselfe or in his instruments this is a large sinne and a great part of atheisme and many are taynted with this sinne either because they are practisioners of witchcraft or else doe seeke helpe of such atheisme in iudgement is that sinne whereby in opinion and perswasion of heart man denie god and this likewise hath three degrees first when man hold and accordingly worshippe the true god creator of heauen and earth but yet so as they conceiue of and worship him otherwise then hee hath reuealed himselfe in his word to this first degree wee must referre the three great religions of the turke of the iewe and of the papists for as they stand at this day they are three great partes of atheisme the turke worshippeth god the maker of heauen amp earth amp likewise reuerenceth christ as man acknowledging him to be a prophet yes a more worthie prophet then his muhammad and yet his religio is atheisme for he coceaueth of god out of the trinitie and so worshippeth nothing but an idoll againe the religion of the iewes at this day is a part of atheisme for howsoeuer they hold one god and acknowledge the bookes of the olde testament for the scriptures of god yet they worship not that god in christ and so instead of the true god frame an idoll in their owne brain for as christ ioh saith whosoeuer denieth the son the same hath not the father so that they wanting christ and by consequent the father also indeed and truly haue no god but as christ tould the samaritans john they worship they knowe not what thirdly the religion of the papists at this day is a part of atheisme we must indeed distinguish it from the two former for in worde they acknowledge the trinitie in vnitie and vnitie in trinitie amp their doctrine of the vnion of christs two natures in one person is according to the scripture but yet if we marke the drift and sequele of their doctrine in other points wee shall find it to bee close atheisme as may bee prooved by two reasons first because the true god who is the creator of heauen and earth is infinite in iustice and mercie but according to the doctrine of the papists god is not infinite in iustice amp mercie and therefore to them is not the true god for first god iustice according to them is not infinite for they teach that a man by his owne proper workes of penance which bee finite amp imperfect may truly satisfy god for the guils of temporall punishment secondly they make thou only of god imperfect by rhem on rom sect pe cing vp the some with mans merits in the worke of redemption for god mercie is either euery way mercie or no mercie as paule saith rom if it bee of grace it is no more of workes or else were grace no more grace and if it bee of workes it is no more grace or else were worke no more worke secondly the christ of the papists is a false christ this will appeare by plaine reason out of their doctrine for first they spoile christ of his true manhood by their doctrine of reall presence wherein they hould that christs body is not onely in heauen but really amp substantially in all places wher the sacrifice of the masse is offered thus they make it omnipotent amp so quite take away the nature of a bodie secondly they disgrade christ from the three offices of his mediatorship first from his kingly office by rhem on ephesian sect placing the pope in his roome and stead as his deputy in christs presence for they giue power to the pope to rule the catholique church and to make lawes to bind mens consciences which bee thinges proper to christ alone where in they doe as much as if they should take the crowne from christs head amp set it on the popes for to claime regencie in the presence of the lawful prince is to proclaime rebellion against the prince for commission of vicegerencie ceaseth in the presence of him that appointeth it nowe christ is alwaies present with his church math and therefore the pope by his claime must needes thrust christ out of his office secondly from his priestly office which consisteth in satisfaction and intercession christs satisfaction they nullifie by rhem on rom sect ioyning therewith the satisfaction of mens workes for thereby they make it imperfect and they robbe him of his intercession by rhem on co sect communicating the same to saintes yes they exalt the virgine marie far aboue christ in this worke for they praie her to aske the father to command christ her son by the authoritie of a mother to doe thus and thus for them and so make christ her vnderling thirdly from his propheticall office by making the pope the infallible iudge of all controuersies avowing that they rather desire to knowe the auncient institution of christian religion from the popes mouth then from holy writte nowe thus robbing christ of his offices they make him a false christ and so wanting the son they cannot haue the father for he ioh that hath not the son hath not the father and therefore popish religion wanting the father and the son cannot bee a true religion but meere coloured atheisme in iudgement the second degree of atheisme in iudgement is when man place some idoll in rome of the true god houlding the same for their god thus did the gentiles sinne in worshipping the son and the moone and the starres or other creatures the third degree is when a man doth avouch hould amp maintaine that there is no god at all this is the highest degree of atheisme and the most notorious sinne that can bee and all such persons as maintain this cursed thought are vnworthie the common breath of man for if that man shall die the death and that worthilie who shall avouch his lawful prince to be no prince howe much more ought hee to die the death though hee had a thousand liues that shall affirme the true god to bee no god thus wee see the fruites of this euill thought whereby the haynousnes of it doth plainly appeare iv point the examination of our owne hearts touching this thought whether it may be found among vs or not doubtles every one will labour to cleare himselfe hereof and the reason wherewith many doe sooth vp themselues is this because they neuer felt in themselues any such conceits as this that there is no god but wee may easily deceiue our selues herein for a man cannot alwaies discerne what bee the thoughts of his owne heart there be in man two kinds of cogitations or as one may say reasons the first is a single cogitation whereby a man simply thinketh or knoweth or iudgeth this or that and this is properly called the mind the other is a reflex cogitatio or reason whereby a man iudgeth that he knoweth or thinketh this or that and it is commonly called conscience now since adams fall the conscience is corrupt by originall sinne as be all other powers of mans soule whece it commeth to passe that conscience can not doe his dutie in giuing true testimonie concerning mans imaginations but a man may thinke euill and yet his conscience not tell him and therefore wee may nor say because wee feele not these euill thoughts in vs therefore we haue them not or we are free from them but that we may the better examine our hearts wee must come to the signes whereby this euill thought is best discerned dauid in the psalme setteth downe three signes hereof first v a disordered life secondly v not calling on the name of god by praier thirdly v contemning of them that put their trust in god looke where these are to be found there is this euill thought that there is no god nowe if wee examine our selues by these signes we shall finde this wicked thought to be amonst vs for first many indeede are content to heare god word but where is that man that reformeth his life according to that he heareth certen it is as their conscience can witnesse few turne vnto god vnfainedly fewe doe breake of their course in sinning now this vnreformed life is an infallible token of this damnable thought secondly the exercise of praier and inuocation on the name of god is rare among man no doubt many a touched heart doth euery day vnfainedly call on god for grace but yet generally this is true man goe on from day to day and from yeare to yeare and neuer pray vnto god for supply of grace indeede man plead for themselues that they vse to pray for they say the lord prayer the creede and the tenne commaundements but wee must know that with many this practise is nothing but a vaine repetition of words for prayer is an action of the heart and not the labour of the tongue and lippes onely so to say the lord prayer is not to pray for the words thereof may be repeated with the heart of an atheist and thirdly the contempt of them that put their trust in god is rise among vs for who is so much scorned and reproched as he that maketh profession of religion now may that complaint be iustly taken vp by the servant of god isai behold i and the children whome the lord hath giuen me are as signes and wonders and he that refraines from euill makes himselfe a pray to the euill tongue isa yet let these scoffers know what euer they be that seedes of atheisme doe possesse their soules to come yet more particularly to the triall of this thought in our selues whosoeuer denieth the presence of god denieth god now let the conscience answer whether we be not afraid to sinne in the presence of many mortall man and yet in the presence of god doe make no bones thereof so the eies of man be turned from vs now what is this but either flatly to denie the presence of god or at least to yeeld more feare and reuerence to man then we doe vnto god againe what is the cause why man vse oppression and iniustice deceit and lying in their wordly affaires is it not because this thought of atheisme doth possesse their hearts that god regardeth not these outward things durst man directly sinne against god in seeking these outward blessings for naturall life if they did rightly relie vpon god prouidence knowing euery good gift to come from his bountifull hand lastly let the conscience speake doth not thy heart while thou goest on in sinne say thus vnto thee god is mercifull i will heareafter repent and so shall i escape punishment if a man doe well obserue his owne heart he shall finde therin this vile thought which directly ouerturns the infinite iustice of god making him a god all of mercie when as indeede he is as well a god of iustice as of mercie by all which it is more then euident that naturally this vile thought runnes in mans heart there is no god vse hereby then we must learne to see what vile miserable and wretched sinners we are in our selues though we had no actuall outward sinnes yet this damnable thought maketh vs accursed if a man ecclesiastes curse the king in his heart the sinne is so great and heinous that the foules of heauen shall disclose it how horrible then is this sinn for a man in his thought to curse god the king of kings and lord of lord this therefore must humble vs in our selues before the lord againe hereby we must be admonished to vse all good meanes whereby wee may come to see and know not onely the grosse actuall sinnes of our liues but especially this damnable thought of our hearts few there be that doe see it and therefore we must be earnest with our selues in searching our owne hearts to find out this and such like abhominations that bee in vs and thus much for the first euill thought the second damnable thought of mans naturall heart concerning god is this the word of god is foolishnesse this thought must principally be vnderstood of the gospel as s paul declareth saying corinthian it hath pleased god by the foolishnes of preaching to saue them that beleeue where hee calleth the gospell of christ foolishnes not that it was so indeede but because the vnconuerted v corinthians and other grecians iudged the preaching of christ crucified the most foolish thing in all the world and in the next chapter he saith co the naturall man that is he that is not effectually called perceiueth not the things of the spirit of god to wit that a man must repent of his sinnes and beleeue in christ for the pardon of them if he would be saued they are foolishnes vnto him nicodemus answer to christ maketh this plaine ioh esteeming regeneration without which christ said no man could enter into the kingdome of heauen to be a mans returne into his mothers wombe and a birth from thence againe this wicked thought must be vnderstood of the lawe of god also the heart of man by nature iudgeth the threatnings of the lawe to be vntruthes and so foolishnesse hence the lord by moses forbad the people when they heard the threatnings and curses of the law denounced against them deut to blesse themselues in their hearts saying wee shall haue peace herevpon he denounceth a woe to them that deride his iudgements threatned and say isa let him make speede let him hasten his worke that wee may see it ampc as if they should say wee doe not beleeue that any such things shall come to passe like to the mockers of whome peter prophecieth pet who walk after their lusts and say where i the promise of his comming now that this is a most damnable thought may appeare by the cursed fruits therof for first hence ariseth that deuilish and carnall opinion of sundrie man that thinke and hold religion to be but humane policie to keepe man in awe and so vse it as a politicke devise to exercise mens braines to keepe them from sedition trecherie and rebellion secondly hence springs all apostacie and departing from the faith the galathians were a worthie church planted by the apostle paul yet euen in his time they began to fall away to another gospell which made him to maruel and the reason was this galat they were not contented with that simplicitie which is in christ but would ioyne with him the obseruation of legall ceremonies the like we may say of those famous easterne churches as those seauen churches of asia planted by the apostles wherin the truth flourished for a while but not long after the apostles times they fell into many damnable heresies as arrianisme amp such like yes about six hundred yeares after christ they embraced the damnable religion of muhammad in the west partes also were worthie and famous churches planted by the apostles and their successors as in italie france germany spaine amp england who about the same time of hudred yeares after christ fell to papisme which spread it selfe ouer all europe and further some few churches of greece excepted in which religion man abandon the gospel of christ and betake themselues to another gospell by adioyning to the truth of christ their owne deuises and this papisme hath raigned euer since till now of late amp so hath apostacie taken place in those churches which the apostles planted the cause whereof was in the wicked and sinnefull heart of man iudging the gospell foolishnes whereupon man were contented to yeilde themselues to any other religion rather then to that simplicitie of truth which is in christ iesus we now in england by god speciall mercie hold and teach the word of god but if god should alter our religion with the times the greatest part of man among vs would forsake the truth and cleaue to any other religion and that only vpon this ground because they iudge the gospell foolishnes let any man among vs broach an error or heresie amp it shall haue patrones at the first be it neuer so vile and absurd amp protectors afterward when that brutish heresie of the familie of loue tooke shipping in germany and ariued in england though it bee an opinion voyde of common sense yet it had applause amongst vs and was receiued of many and would haue spredde it selfe further if the preaching of the word with the care of the magistrate had not suppressed it and the reason heereof is this mans minde by nature is full of darknes he cannot without god speciall grace perceiue the things of god and so he iudgeth the gospell foolishnes and embraceth error rather then the truth yes loueth darknesse rather then the light because his deedes are euill ioh for the examination of our hearts touching this badde thought after due triall wee shall finde that the mindes of most among vs are possessed herewith for we are indeede content to come into the assemblies where god is worshipped and we doe submit our selues to the ministerie of the worde to bee taught and instructed therein wee haue our owne personal sinnes displaid and reprooued and withall very fearefull and terrible curses of the lawe denounced against vs for the same both iudgmentes in this life iudgements in death and also iudgements eternall after this life nowe let the conscience answere what is the cause when wee heare these things that wee be not mooued why are not our hearts touched with greefe and sadnesse when wee heare god iudgments due vnto vs for our sins daylie denounced against vs some indeed there bee whose hearts tremble at the worde but small is that number if a man runne thorough the streets and crie fire fire our hearts are suddenly stroken with great feare but the minister of god may stand and crie fire fire the fyre of hell which is isay kindled by the breath of the lord like a river of brimstone as the prophet speaketh and yet mens hearts are nothing mooued what is the cause that we should bee so affected with the burning of an old house by temporall fyre and be not affraid at the voyce of god which proclameth vnto vs eternall burning with the fire of god wrath surely the cause is this our hearts are forestalled with this false imagination that the curses of the lawe are foolishnes and that there bee no such torments as the world denounceth it will not sinke into the heart of a naturall man that his sinnes are so heinous and god iudgements so terrible against them as the worde maketh them and till such time as this damnable thought be taken away mens hearts will neuer bee touched with the threatnings of the law this is a barre to stoppe the way to all such passions as the lavve would worke againe when the minister of god speaketh of the pardon of sinne and of eternall life by christ who hath his heart melting for ioy in regard of this saluation though man be daily taught the doctrine of saluation yet who learneth the same though man bee called vpon to come into the kingdome of heauen yet fewe striue to enter in though wee bee daily exhorted to repent yet fewe turne to the lord all which bee branches of the gospell but man beleeue them not because their hearts bee filled with this damnable thought the gospell of christ is foolishnes when the israelites were restored from captiuitie in babilon it was as psalm a dreame vnto them nowe if that temporall deliuerance seemed a dreame what a dreame will this spiritual deliuerance from the captiuitie of hell amp death to the libertie of the sonnes of god in grace and glorie seeme to be and indeede to a naturall man it seemes foolishnes that god should become man and that christ by death should free man from death and by suffering the curse of the lawe should take away the same from vs and by his righteousnesse should iustifie vs vnto life all which notwithstanding be points of the gospell this also is the cause why after long teaching there is little turning or faithfull obedience yeelded vnto the gospel neither will it be better with man while this euill thought abideth in them vse if this bee a truth that euery naturall man thinketh the word of god to be foolishnes then wee must learne this lesson of the apostle corinthian hee that seemes to bee wise in this world must become a foole that he may be wise that is he must reiect his owne naturall reason and stoppe vp the eyes of his naturall minde like a blinde man and suffer himselfe wholly to bee guided by god spirite in the thinges of god that thereby he may bee made wise vnto saluation secondly we must heereby learne to make earnest praier vnto god ps for the opening of our eyes that we may bee able to vnderstand the gospell of christ and know the right meaning of that word of saluation for of our selues wee can neuer vnderstand it vnlesse the lord instruct vs by his spirit ioh no man commeth vnto me saith christ that is beleeueth except it bee giuen him of my father but verse euery one that hath heard and learned of the father commeth vnto mee thus much of this second euill thought from the former ariseth an other most vile thought in the heart of euery naturall man as a branch of the same namely because the word of god is foolishnes therefore i will not performe obedience thereunto that this is the naturall thought of man iob teacheth plainely for he bringeth in the wicked that is euery sinner saying thus to god iob depart from vs wee will not the knowledge of thy waies this the wicked man saith not with his mouth for none is so farre past all shame that dares thus blasphemously speake against god but thus hee saith in his heart his affections speake it when he purposed with himselfe to cast off the yoake of god and to liue after his owne lusts and therefore they say further v who is the almightie that wee should serue him as if one should say it is a disgrace to mee to abase my selfe to serue god i will not doe it the prophet ieremie bringeth in the lord saying thus to his people ier stand in the waies and behold and aske for the old way which is the good way and walke therein and yee shall find rest for your soules but in the same place the iewes answer we will not walke in thy waies shall wee thinke that they durst thus impudently answer the lord with open mouthes no surely but the prophet in these wordes setteth downe the purpose of their hearts who hardned the same obstinately against the word when they were exhorted to repentance and obedience before the lord our sauiour christ compareth himselfe to a noble man that goeth into a farre countrey now when he is gone the citizens of his countrey send messengers after him to tell him luke that they will not haue him to raigne ouer them which though it be properly to be vnderstood of the nation of the iewes who did indeede say so to our sauiour christ yet it may also be extended to all impenitent sinners who say in their hearts christ shall not raigne over vs for so long as a man is vncalled he carrieth a purpose to liue in sinne some in this sinne and some in that and so doing saith in his heart god shall not bee my god i will not submit my selfe vnto his lawes christ shall not raigne ouer me this is plaine and manifest by mens behauiour when they are reprooued for their sinnes tell the couetous man of his auarice the swearer of his blasphemy amp the drukard of his drunkennes ampc will he humble himselfe in conscience of his sinn nothing lesse but his heart will swell against thee as his furie and impatience will soone be wray and the reason is because he neuer thinketh of his owne estate how by creatio he oweth homage vnto god as to his creator for his purpose is to goe on in sinne and when he is reprooued for the same his desire is crossed which he can not abide and therefore rageth shewing thereby manifestly that in his heart hee saith he will not obey god commandements for the examination of our hearts touching this thought whether did we euer thinke thus with our selues i will not obey god commandements doubtles euery man wil answer for himselfe that he abhors this thought and yet after iust triall it will appeare that generally this thought is rife among vs for though we heare the word and receiue the sacraments the pledges of our saluation and will be counted the mebers of christ yet whats the cause that there is so little knowledge of god and obedience to his word and why doe man in their callings shew forth so small loue so little mercie iustice and good conscience the truth is that though some haue these things in them in some measute yet the bodie of our people is generally void of these good vertues and fruits of the spirit he that hath but halfe an eye may see it for where is that religious keeping of the sabboth that should be where is that serious performing of worship vnto god which ought to be all which argue that the heart is corrupt and deceiueable and saith indeed to god i will not obey thy word lord depart from me what man almost is there that saith with himselfe oh miserable man what haue i done the vse by this wicked imagination we may see how hard a thing it is truly and soundly to conuert a sinner vnto god and how easily a man may deceiue his owne soule and beguile the world by hypocrisie for a man by long exercise in the word may haue a great measure of knowledge and withall good wit and memorie and with them vtterance and by a common gift of the spirit be able e we must word truly and to conceiue prayer to good purpose and withall haue a cankred heart towards god poisoned with this damnable thought i will not obey the word of god for euery man that hath inwardly in him a purpose to liue though but in one sinne his heart is not vpright with god neither be god graces as faith and repentance sound in his heart for true repentance is a purpose and resolution to leaue all sinne and to please god in all things the third wicked imagination of ma heart concerning thing to worship god this iob sheweth to be true bringing in the wicked man saying iob what profit shall i haue if i pray vnto god we must not thinke that hee said thus with his mouth but in his heart and the prophet malachie bringeth in the iewes saying mal it is a vaine thing to serue god and what profit is it that wee haue kept his commandement amp that we walked humbly before the lord of hostes yes righteous dauid a man after god owne heart was ouertaken with this euill thought when he said psalm certenly i haue cleansed my heart in vaine and washed my hands in innocencie whereby it is plaine that this is a naturall evill thought in every man yet here we must remember that this evill thought comes not into the mind of man at all times but onely at such time when occasio is offered as namely when a man is called on to the seruice of god which vpon some occasion he is desirous to omitte then will his mind range about for libertie from god seruice and so will he bethink himselfe of the wicked mans estate who neuer serued god and yet is in better case outwardly then the godly man is and herevpon hee begins to say in his heart doutbles it is a vaine thing to serue god for the examination of our hearts touching this thought after iust triall it will be found among vs as the state of all sorts of families will declare among the poorer sort you shall see man labour from morning to evening and take great paines to prouide for the world but in the meane time where is the worship and seruice of god where is prayer and thanksgiuing morning and euenning surely it is neglected amp the reason is because they thinke thus in their heart so that i may haue prouision for the world it is no matter whether i serue god or not come to the rich mans house amp there you shal see them spend their time in eating drink gaming and such delightes but the worship of god is not regarded for thus they thinke with themselues if they may haue their pleasure all is well come amp reason with ordinary man and exhort them to vse the meanes of saluation and shew forth loue vnto religion sincerely their answer is they will doe as they haue done and as their forefathers did before them they trust their soules are as good to godward as the best and for ought they see none are worser then those that haue so much preaching and therfore they hope to bee saued though they doe not follow it so much and this also cometh fro this euill thought it is in vaine to serue god marke also in those places wher the gospel is preached if any seeme to make more conscience of sinne and of seruing god then others they are made a by word and a mocking stock and their profession is turned to their reproach which argues plainely that mans thought is this it is a vaine thing to serue god nay take a vew of the whole world and you shall see euery wher man giue themselues to will worship no nation is so barbarous as to denie vnto god all worship but doe they giue vnto him that which he commanded in his word nothing lesse it is either the meere invention of man or altogether stayned therewith this is most euident with the turke the iew and the papist yes our common sort of protestant haue their will worship for generally they content themselues with the mumbling ouer the words of the creede the lord prayer and tenne commandements perswading themselues that by the bare rehearsall of the words they haue sufficiently serued god now would wee know the cause hereof as also why man are so slack and cold in praier so carelesse and vnreuerent in hearing god word surely it is nothing but this vile imagination bewitching our soules that it is a vaine thing to serue god this quencheth the spirit and hindreth all good motios that be in our hearts the fourth euill thought concerning god is a thought of distrust thus framed in the minde god doth not regard me god will not helpe me god will not be mercifull vnto me this thought made entrance vnto the fall of our first parents for first eue looked vpon the fruit amp saw that it was beutifull and then entred into her heart a thought of distrust after this manner it may be it is not true which god hath said to vs concerning this fruit and it may be god regardeth vs not as we thinke he doth in that he denieth vs this fruit heere vpon her will and her affections were carried to the breaking of god commandement and so shee sinned by disobedience and adam also sinned when the people of israel murmured in the wildernes a moses sinned a sin for hee was debarred entrance into the land of canaa nowe what was moses sinne for both he amp aron v prayed to the lord and checked the people saying heare oh yee rebells ampc and at god commandement he brought water out of the rocke surely his sin was secret euen inward vnbeleefe and distrust in god promise for when hee smote the rocke he might thinke thus with himselfe it may bee that god will not nowe giue water out of the rocke amp this seemes the more probable because hee went beyond his comission in smiting thrise vpon the rock whe god bad him onely to speake v vnto it this euill thought takes hould of religious david also psalm i sayd in mine hast i am cast out of thy sight as though he should say heretofore i haue found fauour with god but nowe in mine aduersitie i am vtterly reiected againe psalm i said in my feare all man are lyers that is when feare of death tooke hould of mee then i thought that samuell lied vnto mee when he saide i should come to the kingdome ouer israell the children of israell did often bewray this thought of distrust when they were pinched with hunger and famine in the wildernes they say psalm can god prouid a table for vs in the wildernes can he giue bread and flesh for his people as if they should say we thinke he cannot nor will not yes the apostle peter was not free from this thought for when christ walking on the water commanded peter to come vnto him hee came out boldly and walked towards iesus but when mat hee sawe a mightie wind he began to sinke whence came this surely from a thought of distrust which hee had in his heart to this effect it may be god wil not support me in this my walking amp that this or some such thought was in his heart appeareth by christs answer to him saying h oh thou of little faith why diddest thou doubt by all which it is euident that this is a naturall thought in the minde of man which at some time troubleth the most righteous man that is now touching this thought of distrust two things are to bee skanned first the time when it taketh place in mans minde and secondly the daunger of it for the time this thought doth not alwaies take place in the minde of man but onely in the time of some daunger affliction and temptation and especially in the time of sicknesse and in the pangs of death thus in his grieuous affliction was righteous iob troubled with this thought of distrust for then hee complained that i god did hate him and gnash vpon him with his teeth and as his enemie sharpned his eyes against him yes that v hee made him as his butt and marke to shoote at and dauide in a greiuous trouble of minde thus complained psalm will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will hee shewe no more fauour is his mercie cleane gone for euer doth his promise faile for euermore hath god forgotten to be mercifull ampc whereby appeareth that in his affliction hee was greatly troubled with this distrustfull thought and there is no man liuing but when trouble and affliction comes hee shal feele in himselfe these thoughts of distrust indeede while peace and ease continue presumptuous thoughts possesse the minde but when the daies of peace bee gone amp troublesome times approach then presumptuous thoughts giue place and thoughtes of distrust come in their roome amp stead ii point the daunger of these thoughtes of distrust is verie great as the fruits thereof declare for hence arise first all horrours and terror of conscience all feares and astonishmentes of the heart for when the minde saith though falselie god doth not regard me god will not saue me then the trembling heart is full of horror and dread secondly hence commeth desperation it selfe wherby man cofidently avouch that god hath forsaken them and cast them of and that there is no hope of life but present death remaining for them this thought troubleth the minde of the wicked and of the repentant person also for desperation is nothing but the strength of this thought of distrust thirdly this weakneth the foundation of our saluation which standeth in the certentie of god promises for this thought of distrust denieth credite to god promises and maketh them vncertaine among all other euill thoughtes this doth most directly hinder saluatio for it is flat against faith as water is to fire for true faith makes a man say with good cosciece gal christ died and shedd his blood for mee god the father will bee mercifull vnto me and saue me but this distrustfull thought causeth a man to say the clean contrarie christ died not for me god will not saue me so that where this thought prevaileth true faith is not neither can take place vse considering the danger of this distrustful thought is so great we must be admonished in the feare of god to vse all good meanes while the daies of peace doe last that it take no place with vs in the daie of trouble and temptation the meanes to represse it are the preaching of the worde and the sacraments of baptisme and the lord supper for the first the word of god preached is a speciall meanes ordained of god for the true applying of god promises of mercie to our owne soules and therefore a most soueraigne remedie against this thought of distrust for whe the promises of mercie in christ are offered vnto god people in the preaching of the worde by a lawful minister it is as much as if christ himselfe in his owne person should speake vnto them by vertue of god ordinance if god from heauen should say to any man mercie belongeth to thee hee would beleeue if god say to cornelius boleeue thou and my mercie belongs to thee cornelius will beleeue if hee say to peter beleeue thou and my mercie belongs to thee peter will beleeue and if hee say so to marie magdalen shee will beleeue loe heere when the minister of god out of god worde saith to any man beleeue thou and repent thou and god mercie belongs vnto thee it is as much as if the lord should call him by name particularly and say vnto him beleeue thou and repent and my mercie belongs vnto thee yes it is all one as if god himselfe should say i am thy father and thou article my childe if thou wilt repent and beleeue the second meanes which is also very effectuall to cut off this thought of distrust is baptisme if an earthly prince giue a pardon to any man amp put the mans name in the pardon and his owne broade seale vnto it the man will neuer doubt of his pardon but beleeue it beholde in baptisme god entreth couenant with miserable wretched man and heerein makes promise of life vnto him yes hee puts the mans name in the couenant sealing the same with his owne seale amp therefore the party baptized must beleeue against this thought the thirde meanes is the lord supper rightly administred and receiued for therin the breade and wine giuen to the hand of euery communicant by the minister are particular pledges and tokens vnto them of speciall mercie in christ these are the meanes which wee must vse with all good conscience in the daies of peace that when troubles come this thought of distrust may not preuaile against vs and thus much of mans naturall euill thoughts against god many other might bee added herevnto but these beeing the principall i omit the rest now wee come to the euill thoughtes of mans naturall heart against his neighbour and to find them out wee must haue recourse to the second table of the morall lawe which was penned with respect to gal the corrupt estate of man forbidding that which mans corrupt heart thinketh naturally against his neighbour for euery commandement thereof is spirituall forbidding not onely the wicked actions euill wordes and gestures but all corrupt affections yes all euill imaginations of man against man these thoughts of man against his neighbour be of two sorts either without consent or with consent thoughts without consent are the very first euill motions of the minde which a man conceiueth against his neighbour to which the will neuer giueth consent and these are forbidden in the commandement thou shalt not lust thoughts with consent of will are such as a man conceiuing in his minde doth withall desire or purpose in his heart to practise and these are forbidden in the fift sixt seauenth eight and ninth commandements by reason whereof they may fittely be reduced to fiue heads they are either thoughts of dishonour against the fift commandement or thoughts of murther against the sixt or thoughts of aduletrie against the seuenth or thoughts of theft against the eight or thoughts of disgrace against the ninth commandement first a thought of dishonour is any thought that tendeth to the contempt and abasing of the person of our neighbour in respect of our selues and it is then conceiued in our mindes when we thinke thus of all other man beside our selues such and such a man is farre inferiour vnto me a base and contemptible fellow in regard of me example hereof we haue in the pharisie a man strict in profession and zealous in his religion who commeth to the temple to pray with the publican now marke what he saith luke oh god i thanke thee that i am not as other man are or as this publican which wordes proceede from such a proud thought as this lord i thanke thee all other man are farre inferiour vnto me i doe farre surpasse the common sort this publican is a base fellowe and no body to me if any shall imagine that this thought is not in euery mnn but in some few proud persons i answer it is by nature in euery person liuing without grace and therefore s paul giueth this commandement that philipp euery man in meekenesse should esteeme others better then himselfe giuing vs to vnderstand that by nature all man thinke best of themselues and esteeme others farre worse then themselues the vse if this thought of dishonour be in all mens hearts then behold what a pallace of all satanicall and damnable pride the heart of man is naturally it is like vnto the table of adoni bezek at which he sate in a chaire of estate and made others euen kings to eate meate like dogs vnder his feete with their thumbs cutte off such an one is euery man by nature hee lifteth vp himselfe saying i am the man and treadeth his brother vnder his feete as no body vnto him and this is the cause of much strife and hurt in all humane societies this causeth many iarres much skorning and great contempt among man in word and deede now that we may reforme this thought in vs wee must learne to say as iob did after he had beene afflicted and came to see his sinnes iob behold i am vile and with abraham gen i am but dust and ashes and with dauid i am a worme and no man psalm yes with paul rom we must labour to see our miserie by reason of sinne and that will helpe to pull downe the pride of our hearts the second euill thought of man against his neighbour with consent is a thought of murther or of any thing that tendeth thereto of this wee haue particular examples in scripture deut the lord forbiddeth the iewes to haue this murthering thought in their hearts i will not releeue the poore i will not doe good vnto them giuing vs to vnderstand that this was the common thought of the iewes or els he would not haue forbidden it yes the lord doth there set out this thought by two signes first an euill eye when a man turnes his countenance from the poore or looketh on them without compassion secondly vnmercifull dealing when a man will not helpe the poore by gift according to his abilitie and because all actions proceede from thoughts the heart beeing the fountaine of our deedes hence it appeareth that this murthering thought against the poore is rife in this age for where is the man that doth pitie the poore and doth good to them according to his abilitie nay the lord complaint against the iewes may be fitly applied to our times in regard of crueltie and oppression the spoile of the poore is in your houses what haue ye to doe that ye beate my people to peeces and grinde the faces of the poore isa the second example of a murthering thought is cocerning god church and it is this i will doe some spite or hurt to them that worship god for proofe hereof read psalm dauid bringeth in the babilonians edomites ampc saying thus one to another against god people the iewes let vs destroy them all together amp psalm let vs cut them off from beeing a people and let the name of israell be no more in remembrance now as this was their thought so is it the thought of all man naturally for that which was the disposition of babel edom moab and amnon against god church is the disposition of all man naturally for looke how generall the hatred of man is so generall is the purpose of mischiefe against those that professe religion for all man by nature are haters of god church amp people so christ saith to his disciples matth yee shall be be hated of all nation for my names sake yes whosoeuer killeth you shall thinke that he doth god good seruice and therefore this thought of doing mischiefe is as general euen in the minde of euery man by nature this further appeareth by the continuall persecution that hath euer beene raised agaiust god poore church since the beginning of the world it began at abell soone after the giuing of the couenant of grace to our first parents and hath continued to this day amp shall abide vnto the end so that if carnall man could look into their owne hearts they should there behold this murdering thought against god people this murdering thought commeth from another wicked imagination set downe by s peter who bringeth in the wicked of this world pet thinking it a strange thing that god children doe not as they doe and runne not with them vnto all excesse of riot liuing in drunkennes fornication and such other abhominations for this cause doe they coceiue hatred and purpose mischeife against god people and so will continue till god giue them grace to repent if any shall say this thought is not generall for nabuched nezer danie an heathen man shewed fauour to daniell and highly aduanced him i answer it is true he did so but that was a worke of god speciall providence who procured him fauour and disposed the kings heart to affect him as he did also the heart of the chiefe daniel eunuch otherwise nabuchad nezzer naturally did nothing but intend mischeife against god church as his rage against the three children did euidetly bewray daniel a third example of this murthering thought i adde which every minister of god word may obserue by daily experience and that is this when mens faults are particularly rebuked in the ministery of the word and the quicke as it were touched by applying the word to the cosciece then will the heart of a naturall man thus conceiue of the minister that reprooueth sinn this man meaneth me he hath some spyte and mallice against me that he thus reprooveth my particular faults when as the minister knew them not to be his personall sinnes but it is the power of the word that ransaketh the sinfull heart this is the fault of all carnall hearers who will heare quietly till their faults be rebuked but then they thinke maliciously of the preacher thus herod dealt with john baptist he heard him gladly for a while mark but when he was rebuked for his brother phillips wife then he cast john in prison luke and if conscience might bee iudge many an hearer would be found to haue an herods heart towards god minister the third thought of man touching his neighbour is the thought of adulterie which is the thought with consent to any vnchastitie such a thought had iudah cocerning tamar his daughter in lawe when gen he iudged her an whore and desired to lie with her and with such thoughts was ammons sam heart so sore vexed that hee fell sicke for his sister tamar this makes a man an adulterer in heart before god though actually he commit not the fact mat the fourth is the thought of theft which is the thought with consent of beguyling or wronging another in his goods or substace this is that imagining of iniquitie and working of wickednes vpon their beds in coueting of fieldsagainst which micah micah pronounceth a woe and this thought also possesseth their hearts that with the wicked israelites wish the time were come wherein they amos might make the epha small and the shekell great that is lessen the measure and inhance the pryce and falsifie the weights by deceit the first euill thought is a thought of disgrace which some way tendeth to the reproach and debasing of our neighbours good name as when a thing is well done to thinke amp iudge it to bee ill done or when a thing is a misse to iudge it worse then it is thus elie thought disgracefullie of hannah deeming her to bee dronke saying am put away thy dronkennes when shee prayed deuoutly from a v troubled soule to the lord thus eliab dauids eldest brother thought disgracefullie of dauid when he shewed himselfe willing to encounter with golyah that reuiled the hoast of the liuing god saying sam i know the pride and mallice of thine heart that thou article come to see the battell when as indeede the spirit of god put that motion into his heart to take away the shame from israell as the happie euent declared plainly so when our sauiour christ spake most comfortably to the sicke of the palsie saying math be of good comfort thy sinnes are forgiuen thee then the cursed hearts of the wicked pharisies thought thus in themselues u this man blasphemeth and when the gift of the holie ghost was sent vpon the apostles causing them to speake strange tounges to the great admiration of man of diverse nation then some of the malicious iewes thought they were dronke saying scoffingly they were full of newe wine act and this thought of disgrace is in euery man naturally bringing forth continually the fruits of disgrace as envy strife emulations dissentions and debates for loue thinketh not euill but naturally true loue is wanting in all man and therfore they cannot but thinke euill of others we see the fiue euill thoughts of mans naturall heart against his neighbour touching which two things are yet further to bee skanned to wit when these euill thoughtes doe arise in the minde and in whome they are for the first it is true that they doe not at all times arise in mens mindes but then onely when occasion is giuen at which time they arise so soone as it is giuen for mans heart is like to tinder or drie wood which burneth not of it selfe but so soone as fire is put to it then presently it kindleth when you come to talke with a naturall man it may be for the present hee thinketh not to lie but giue him occasion to lie and then hee soone bethinkes himselfe therof amp will not spare to vtter it if it may make for his aduantage and the like wee may say of malice adulterie theft disgrace or any other sinne against our neighbour doe but minister occasion there about to the naturall heart of man amp he thinketh of them and without god grace restraining or renuing him will bring forth the same in action the second point in whom are all these euill thoughts answer in all man naturallie without exception till they be renewed by god speciall grace yes the truth is these thoughts doe euery where abound for looke what man doe practise that first of all they thinke for the thought is the beginning of euery action but in the worlde all sins against the second table doe abound as the practise of dishonour of murther adulterie thefts and disgraces and therefore these euill thoughts from whence these actions come must needes be common vse by this wee may see what a huge masse of corruption the naturall heart of man is without god special grace for thoughts of dishonour make a mans heart a pallace of prid like the table of adoni bezek also thoughts of crueltie make mans heart a slaughterhouse thoughts of adulterie make it a most filthie stewes thoughts of theft make it to become a denne of theeues wherein all manner of fraud and bad dealing is plotted amp devised and lastly thoughts of disgrace make it a fountaine of backbyting debate slander and reuiling and therfore howsoeuer the outward life may be ordered ciuillie yet without god grace mans heart is most vile and those that pleade their good nature and good meaning are heere confuted for naturally the heart thinkes all euill against his neighbour the third kinde of mans naturall euill thoughtes are such as concerne himselfe amp they are principally foure the first may fitlie bee termed a thought of pride wherby euerie man naturallie thinkes himselfe most excellent and far to exceede all other man whatsoeuer thus the prophet isay bringeth in babylo speaking in her heart that is thinking isay i will ascend into heauen and exalt my throne aboue or besides the stars of god as if shee should thinke with her selfe i am farre more excellent then any other what soeuer amp therefore i am to bee exalted from the earth to heauen and to bee matched with god himselfe and the prophet zephame bringeth in ni iue speaking thus in her heart zeph i am and there is none besides me and so the proud pharisie in his priuate and secret prayer to god sayeth luke i thanke thee lorde that i am not as other man meaning that he is more excellent and the whore of babylo the hereticall church of rome is brought in saying of her selfe revelation i sit as a queene and am no widdowe and shall see no mourning all which places shew this to bee the nature of man to exalt himselfe in his owne heart aboue all others if any shall say heereby no more can bee prooued but that this thought is in some proud and insolent persons i adde therfore that as our first parents in the beginning did learne that proud lesso of the divell ye shall be as god so we being in their loynes when they sinned and descending from them by ordinarie gineration doe together with our nature receiue that corruption from them whereby wee thinke thus proudly of our selues that we far excell others and are as little god on earth in respect of others indeede the most will say for themselues wee abhorre this proude thought neither did wee euer finde it to bee in vs but we must know that the less we discern it in our selues the more it reigneth in our hearts and the more wee discerne and bewaile it the less place it taketh in vs now touching this thought of pride two things must bee obserued the danger and the highest degree of it for the danger of this thought the outward affecting of strange fashions in apparell is a wonderfull pride but the most vile and wretched pride of all is that spirituall pride of the heart whereby a man despiseth all other in regarde of himselfe and thinketh himselfe far better then any this i manifest by sundrie reasons as first from the fruites of this inward pride for hence doe slowe many damnable sinnes in mens liues and conuersations as first ambition whereby man are not content with that estate wherewith god hath belssed them but doe seeke by all meanes to bee advanced to higher dignitie amp estate secondly presumption whereby man dare enterprise things beyond their calling and aboue their power taking vppon them more then they are able for thirdly boasting wherby a man speaks of himselfe more then is seemely amp extolleth himselfe aboue his desert fourthly hipocrysie when a man pretendeth he hath that grace and religion which indeed he hath not or els maketh shew of more grace then is truly in him fiftly obstniacie when a man persisteth in an errour amp will not yeeld to the truth though it be manifested vnto him sixtly contention wherby man striue one against another in word or deed without relenting and lastly affectation of novelty especially in outward attyre for when a mans coceiues so highly of himselfe then withall he thinkes no manner of attyre good enough to bewtifie and adorne his body and so begins to deuise and affect strange and foreign attyre secondly the danger hereof appeareth hence that where this thought of pride raigneth as it doth in all man naturally there the spirit of grace dwelleth not mary in her song saith well luke god scattereth the imaginations of the proud that is of those which haue this coceit of their owne excellencie aboue others and s iames iam god resisteth the proud and giueth grace to the humble yes thus saith he isa that is high and excellent he that inhabiteth eternitie whose name is the holy one i dwell in the high amp holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to reuiue the spirit of the humble but he that lifteth vp himselfe his minde is not vpright in him habak thirdly such is the danger of this sinne that when all other sinnes die in a man this thought of pride dyeth not nay when other sinnes are mortified and god graces come in stead thereof yet this will then reuiue and make the graces of god matter whereon to worke as when an ignorant person attaines to some knowledge this pride will take occasion from that gift of god to puffe vp the heart yes when a man in true humilitie of heart shall renounce the actions of pride yet the wil pride be working for this is a fruit of pride to thinke well of our selues because we are not proud ii point the highest degree of this pride is when a man thinketh himselfe to bee equall with god this is a most notorious nay an abhominable height of pride and yet the truth is some man haue come herevnto thus the king of babel thought of himselfe when he said in his heart isa i will ascend aboue the height of the clowdes and will be like the most high it may seeme strange that man should thinke thus of themselues but we must know that man may doe it two waies first when they thinke they haue power of themselues whereby they are able to match or counteruaile the power of god so thought nabuchad nezar whe he said daniel who is that god that can deliuer you out of my hand such a thought had proud pharao in his heart when he said to moses amp aaron exod who is the lord that i should heare his voice amp let israel goe secondly when they take to themselues the honour of god and thinke it to be due to them thus did herod act when by silence he approued the blasphemous voice of the people who cried vnto him the voice of god and not of man and thus antichrist sitting in the temple of god thess exalts himselfe aboue all that is called god or worshipped now that man of sinne is the pope of rome for howsoeuer in word he humble himselfe amp call himselfe the servant of servant yet indeede through the pride of his heart he sitteth as god taking vnto himself that honour which is proper to god for he claimeth power to prescribe new rules of god worship to forgiue sinnes to make lawes to bind the conscience properly yes to open and shut heauen and to dispose at his pleasure of earthly kingdomes he taketh vpon him to dispence with the morall lawe and with apostolicall constitutions all which belong to god alone and none dare claime them to belong vnto him but he that matcheth himselfe with god and this is the highest decree of pride the vse by this euery man may see what he is of himselfe what a cursed and proud nature he carrieth about with him for euery man naturally when occasion is offered thinks highly of himselfe and basely of others in regard of himselfe let vs therefore take notice of this satanicall pride that is in our nature and striue against it for who would not be ashamed to say with the proud pharasie i thanke thee lord i am not as other man ampc or with the arrogant iewes stand apart touch me not i am holier then thou isay the second euill thought concerning a mans selfe is this i am sufficiently righteous and i need no repentance that this is the thought of euerie man naturally appeareth by the lord commandement to the people of israell forbidding them to say in their hearts when they were placed in the promised land deut that for their owne righteousnes the lord brought them in to possesse it wherby he giueth vs to vnderstand two things first that as the iewes did there so euerie man thinks himself to be righteous and secondly he thinks that god doth giue his blessings vnto him for his owne righteousnes for the lord vseth not to forbidde such a thought as man naturally haue not in them so in like manner when ieremie rebuked the people for their sinnes they said ierem they were innocent and guiltles they had not sinned and the church of laodicea saith thus of her selfe reverand i am rich and neede nothing that is i abound in spirituall graces this is the thought of the proud luke pharisie who trusts in himselfe that he is iust and therfore braggeth vnto god that he is not such and such but he doth this and that he fasteth he giueth almes paieth tithes ampc and in plaine tearmes his heart saith this i am righteous i neede no repentance for of such christ spake when he said matht he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance and againe i say vnto you luke that ioy shall be in heauen for one sinner that conuerteth more then for ninetie and nine iust man which need none amendment of life where we must obserue that christ meaneth not that there are in deede some so righteous that they neede no amendment but he speaketh according to the opinion which some haue of themselues to witte that they are righteous and neede no repentance by all which it is more then manifest that this is a naturall thought of a man concerning himselfe this euill thought raigneth in our age and time as all the former doe for come to an ignorant man that hath not beene instructed in religion reason with him touching his estate and aske him whether he can keepe the law of god or not he will answer he can he loueth the lord his god with all his heart and his neighbour as himselfe aske him how hee lookes to be saued his answer is by his owne righteousnes and for his owne goodnesse if due examination were made this would be found to be the thought of many that liue in the church among vs and there is none by nature free from this thought hereby then we may see that the thoughts of euery man be he what he will are plaine popery for popery is naturall one chiefe pillar and ground thereof is iustification and saluation by workes which opinion euery man brings with him from his mothers wombe and so it is in the point of merit man naturally thinke they receiue the good things which they haue from god for their own righteousnes secondly hence it appeareth that it is a matter of great difficultie to bring a man throughly to renounce his owne righteousnes and soundly and heartily to imbrace true religion and the righteousnes of christ by faith this is no lesse then the change of nature and yet this must euery man doe that will be saued he must be come nothing in himselfe that he may be all in christ iesus which is as impossible to nature as to change water into fire and therfore man had need to beware how they put off the time amp neglect the meanes in which god shewes his power in working this change in the hearts of his elect thirdly hence we see the euident cause of that preposterous course of the world which most man take in spending their witte and strength some for riches others for honours and pleasures and in the meane while they can spare no time for religion to seeke god fauour in christ and the graces of the spirit it may bee they will afford a good worde vnto religion but yet they regarde it not in respect of other things and this is the behauiour not of some few but of all sorts and degrees of man naturally now the cause heereof is this cursed euill thought whereby man perswade themselues they be righteous and need no repentance and till this thought be rooted out of mans heart he will neuer value the word and religion of god according to the worth thereof so as with the good marchant he wil part with al that he hath rather then he wiil be frustrate of this pearle math indeede man vse to pleade thus for themselues wee confesse our selues to be sinners and therefore wee cannot thinke such a wicked thought that we need no repentance but we must knowe that both these may well stand together in the wicked heart of man he may confesse himselfe to bee a sinner and yet thinke that hee is righteous for is not this the comon practise to make great sins little sins amp little sins no sins doe not man cloath vice in vertues robe and turne out vertue in the rotten ragges of vice is not drunkennes counted good fellowship amp kinde neighbourhood is not swearing made the token of a braue minde and pride counted decencie and fornication but a tricke of youth and couetousnes esteemed good thrift and carefulnes on the other side is not the more sincere profession of religion termed precysenes puritanisme hypocrisie and such like doth not hee that refrayneth the common sinnes of the time make himselfe a pray to the mouthes of the vngodly nowe where these things are though the mouth say i am a sinner yet the heart thinketh i am righteous and so it is apparant this thought is common among vs the third euill thought concerning a mans selfe is a thought of securitie in the time of peace and prosperitie man say thus in their hearts i am free from all god iudgements i am in no danger of hell death or damnation but sure enough of saluation it may bee thought that none is so bewitched of the deuill as to haue this conceit of himselfe but the scripture is most plaine in the proofe hereof psalm the wicked man such as is euery man by nature as wee shewed before saith in his heart i shall neuer be mooued nor bee in danger and the prophet isaiah brings in wicked man saying isaiah we haue made a couenant with death and with hell wee are at agreement which must not be vnderstood as done indeed for death and hell will make league with none but onely in mens wicked imagination perswading themselues that they bee in no danger of hell or of the graue for so much the next wordes import that though a scourge runne ouer amp passe thorough yet it shall not come at vs yes righteous dauid was ouertaken heerewith for in his prosperitie he said in his heart psalm i shall neuer bee mooued much more then is it the thought of euerie naturall man to say with the rich foole vpo the increase of outward blessings luke soule soule take thine ease thou hast enough nothing can hurt thee the vse by this wee may come to the knowledge of a thing which falleth out in all ages worth our diligent obseruation it hath pleased god from time to time to send his prophets and ministers to call his people to repentance thus did isay ieremy ioell amos amp the rest yes the lorde himselfe as zeph zephanie saith riseth euery morning and bringeth his iudgementes to light which should turne man from their sinnes hee faileth not and yet the wicked will not learne to be ashamed to come to our owne times it hath pleased god to stirre vp many worthie ministers vnto vs who spende their time and strength in labouring to bring man to repentance and saluation but yet who is he almost that turneth from his sinnes yes the lord himselfe as in former times so nowe doth preach from heauen by his iudgements as famine plague ampc and yet by lamentable experience wee see that the bodie of our people remaine secure they are ier setled on their lees and zeph frozen in their dregges no man stirreth vp himselfe to say ier what haue i done now the cause heereof is nothing els but this cursed thought of securitie whereby a man saith thus in his heart i am free from god iudgements read matth as it was in the daies of noah saith our sauiour christ so shall it bee in the daies of the comming of the son of man they did eate drinke marrie wiues and giue in marriage and knewe nothing till noah entred into the arke and the floode came and tooke them all away quest howe could it be that they should knowe nothing seeing noah had preached vnto them of the floode an hundred and twentie yeares before ans surely it was as if they had knowne nothing for they would not beleeue him it would not sinke into their heads much lesse settle in their hearts that god would destroy all the worlde by water and so may it bee saide of these times wee knowe nothing though wee be called to repentance by the ministerie of the worde yet we will not repent and though wee heare of god iudgements we thinke our selues free from them and will not beleeue till the beesome of his wrath sweepe vs all away as the flood did the old world wherefore to redresse among vs this damnable thought of securitie let vs consider our grieuous sinnes in particular and set before our eyes the curse of god both temporall iudgements and eternall death due vnto vs for the same it is the applying of god heauie wrath that must make vs shake off this secure thought which the rather we must do though it be grieuous to the flesh and as a pange vnto death in a naturall man because till this thought bee remooued the sauing graces of god spirite will not take rooting in our hearts the fourth and last euill thought of mans heart touching himselfe is this in time of miserie hee saith his crosses are greater and worser then indeede they are so iobe complaineth in his affliction that iob his griefe amp miserie was heauier then the sand of the sea shoare and the church in great affliction calls thus to passengers lam behold and see if there be any sorrowe like vnto my sorrowe which is done vnto mee and that it is the thought of euery mans heart naturally appeareth by experience for let a man bee in distresse outwardly or else touched in coscience for his sinnes when you shall labour to minister comfort vnto him according to god worde hee will answer that neuer any was in like ase to him so grieuously tormented amp afflicted as he is and indeede it is the propertie of mans naturall heart to esteeme ionah little crosses to be exceeding great yes oftentimes to deeme that to bee a crosse which is none at all the reason is the want of iudgement rightly to discerne the state of their affliction and the want of strength to support it as it is for if thou be faint in the day of aduersitte thy strength is small for the remedie of this euill thought prou first wee must seeke to rectifie the imagination by bringing the minde to a right con eit of the affliction this is a special course to be obserued in dealing with the that bee oppressed with any distresse for a strong conceit of a mans owne miserie doth many times more hurt then the miserie it selfe therefore be sure the iudgement be well informed and then the cure is halfe wrought and the crosse halfe remooued this done the partie afflicted may well consider the desert of sinne in the endlesse torments of the damned which the lord preuenteth in his children by temporall chastisements in this life corinthian for when we are iudged wee are chastened of the lorde that wee might not be condemned with the world and so labouring to bee humbled for sinne and to lay hold on god mercy in christ through whom all things euen afflictions worke together for the best no doubt he will bee able to say mich i will beare the wrath of the lorde because i haue sinned against him and psalm why article thou cast downe oh my soule why article thou so disquieted within me wayte on god for i will yet giue him thankes he is my present helper and my god thus much of mans euill thoughts concerning himselfe hauing spoken of mans naturall euill thoughts concerning god his neighbour and himselfe we come to the second point to be observed in the text to wit that there is a want of good thoughts and consideration in euery an naturally for the lord here faith his thoughts are evill from his youth and chap they are onely euill euery day now looke where euill is onely and continually there good must needes be wating altogether this want must be considered either in respect of temporall or of spirituall things by temporall things i meane such worldly affaires and actions as concerne mans naturall life wherein though good consideration be not taken quite away yet wee must know that the same is corrupt and very weake and imperfect even as reason is and there is much want in euery man in this behalfe ecclesiastes there is one alone saith salomon and there is not a second which hath neither son nor brother yet there is none end of his travell neither can his eye bee satisfied with riches neither doth hee thinke for whom doe i travell heere behold a notable example of this want of good consideration about earthly things that a man should spend both his wit amp strength in heaping vp riches and knowes not to whom he shall leaue them but we need not be inquisitiue for examples for we may daily obserue in our selues and others apparent want of good consideration in these worldly affaries which must not seeme strange vnto vs seeing that reason it selfe the ground of cosideration is greatly blemished through the corruption of nature about these earthly things in things spirituall which concerne the kingdome of god there is in our nature an absolute want of good consideration herein of our selues we haue no good thoughts we are not of our selues saith corinthian paul sufficient to thinke any thing that is any good thing as of our selues the whole bodie of the gospell is therefore called a mystery because the things therein contained and revealed are such as corinthian neuer came into mans heart to thinke this want we may obserue especially in foure things in respect of god presence and prouidence of god iudgements of our owne sinnes of our dutie to god first man by nature doth not thinke of or consider god presence and prouidence to behold and to remember all his waies in thought word and deed hereof the lord complaines against ephraim and samaria saying they haue dealt falselyand they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickednes and the same is the state of euery naturall man beeing left to himselfe for all by nature are equally corrupt with originall sinne and so are destitute of this good thought which yet may appeare the more plaine by this that naturally mans heart is possessed of the cleane contrary to wit god shall not see god will not regard as hath beene shewed before and indeed it is a worke of grace to haue the heart rightly affected with this thought god beholds all my waies he considers and remembers euery thing i doe flesh and blood can not attaine vnto it secondly a man by nature doth not consider or thinke of the iudgements of god temporall and eternall due vnto sinne this thought was wanting in the man of the old world though noah preached vnto them an hundred and twentie yeares of the gecerall deluge yet the consideration of it tooke no place in their hearts and therefore it is said matth they knew nothing till the flood came and tooke them all away from the want of this thought it came to passe that gen lotts sonnesin lawe thought their father had but mocked when he told them that god would destroy sodom hence it was that the luke rich foole blessed himselfe in his heart saying soule soule take thine ease amp neuer bethought himselfe of any danger till it was said vnto him o foole this night will they fetch away thy soule and shall wee thinke this thought is now wanting at this day seeing christ hath said mat as it was in the daies of noe so shall it bee at the comming of the son of man thirdly a man naturally doth neuer bethinke himselfe of his owne sinnes he hath no purpose of heart seriously to examine his life past or to repent of such sinnes as he findeth in him this appeareth by the lord own complaint against the iewes who were so farre from turning fro their sins that not one would say in his heart ier what haue i done nay when they had comitted most sottish idolatry isay in making an idoll god of one part of a tree with the other part thereof they had rosted their meate and warmed themselues yet they considered not this in their hearts neither had they knowledge or vnderstanding to say i haue burnt halfe of it in the fire i haue baked bread vpon the coales thereof i haue roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abhomination fourthly a naturall man doth not consider what duty amp seruice he owes vnto god his mind is wholly bent to his owne waies but the mat lord talet lies hid in the ground wrapt vp in a napkin hereof the lord complaines against the iewes ier that they sayd not in their hearts let vs feare the lord our god hence it was that the mat foolish virgin did content themselues with the blasing lamp of an outward profession and neuer be thought themselues of that oyle of grace which god required in all those that would enter with christ into his bridechamber till it was too late and the sleight seruing of god at this day declares the generall want of this cosideration heere further wee must know that this want of good consideration is a grieuous evill and a mother sinne from whence as from a fountaine streames of corruptions and transgressions both of heart and life doe issue forth first hereby we are disabled from yelding vnto god that obedience of heart which his law requireth for how can we loue the lord with all our thought and mind amp our neighbour as our selues as god luke commandeth when as naturally our hearts are void of all good thoughts towards god and towards our neighbours againe whence comes sinning with an high hand when man sinne and will sinne whence comes it that man blesse themselus in their sinnes and flat themselues in their owne eies while they goe on in sinne but from want of consideration of god presence and of god iudgements this abraham knew well and therfore saide of the people of gerar because gen they wanted the feare of god that is all consideration of god presence and of god iudgements therefore they would kill him for his wiues sake whence also comes that sensualitie whereby man addict them selues wholly to the profit pleasures and honours of this world neuer minding heauen or hell but from want of consideration of their dutie to god if man did vse to call themselues to accompt for their sinnes or did set before their eyes the iudgements of god due vnto them it could not be that there shoud be such want of contrition towards god or of compassion towards their brother as euery where abounds and the like might be said of many other capitall sinnes all which proceede from the want of good consideration where by the way we may obserue that our common people doe farre deceiue themselues in this perswasion of themselues that by nature they haue good hearts and good meaning if you charge them with the sinnes of their liues they will straightway plead their good intention and say though they sometime faile in action yet they meane well alwaies but the truth is naturally well meaning and good consideration spirituall thinges is altogether wanting and therfore while man doe soothe vp themselues in their good meaning they deceiue their owne hearts through ignorance of their naturall estate and they must knowe that they can neuer come vnto christ that they might haue life till they be quite gone out of themselues in regard of such conceits hauing seene what euill thoughts be in euery man naturally amp what good thoughts be wanting in him it followeth now to make some vse of this doctrine concerning mans naturall imaginations the first vse shall be against all atheists who thinke the scripture to be meere policie deuised by man to keepe man in awe but we are to know that the holy scripture is no deuise of man but the very word of the euerliuing god which i thus demonstrate out of the former doctrine the scripture saith in generall that all the imaginations of euery naturall man are euill and that continually nowe it doth not onely affirme this in generall but declares it also in particular for elsewhere it sheweth what those particular euill thoughts be which the naturall minde of man frameth concerning god his neighbour and himselfe againe the same scripture saith in generall that good thoughts and considerations are naturally wanting in euery man and elsewhere it declareth in particular what those good thoughts be which enter not into the mind of a natural man both these haue bin plainly shewed out of the word of god nowe herevpon it doth necessarily follow that the scripture is the word of god for let the cunning atheist shew whence it is that the scripture doth declare mans thoughts hee cannot say of man for no man knoweth the thoughts of another nay he cannot finde out his owne thoughts neither can hee ascribe it to any angell good or bad for the minde of man is hid from them they knowe not mans thoughts it remaineth therefore that as god alone is the searcher of the hearts so that scripture which declareth vnto man what bee his thoughts is the onely word of the same god indeed god vsed man for his instrument in the penning and deliuerie of the scripture but hee himselfe by his spirite is the sole author thereof the second vse shall bee against the papists who ascribe to mans will a naturall power to that which is truly good as by it selfe to co worke with god grace in the first act of mans conuersion but the charge of euill heere layd vpon the frame of mans naturall heart by god himselfe doth teach vs otherwise for looke howe farre the frame of the minde which is the principall part of the soule is corrupt for thoughts and imaginations so farre is the will the inferiour part of the soule corrupt in willing but the minde is naturally so corrupt that it can not thinke a good thought and therefore answerably the will by nature is so corrupt that it can not will that which is truly good if it be said that man hath libertie of will in humane actions and in ciuill duties answer he hath but yet such actions proceeding from a corrupt fountaine are sinnes in euery naturall man howsoeuer for the matter of the works they may be called good beeing such as god himselfe ordained the third vse shall be for admonition vnto them to whome is committed the education of youth as parents masters tutors ampc that seeing the imaginations of mans heart are euill from his youth therefore they must all ioyne hand in hand betime to stop vp or at least to lessen this corrupt fountaine parents must sow the seedes of grace into the minds of their young children that if it were possible euen at their mothers breasts they might be nourished in the faith thus dealt lois and eunice with their young timothie for paul saith tim he learned the holy scriptures of an infant then as their children grow in descretion and vse of reason they must be ephesians nurtered in religion and haue the grounds thereof by often repetition driuen into their hearts for this is the best meanes to free their minds though not altogether from naturall imaginations yet from the force and poison thereof for pro follie is bound to the heart of a childe but the rodde of teaching that is instruction with correction will driue it away from him yes when as the pro child set at libertie makes his mother ashamed yet will ibid the son that is well instructed giue his father rest amp yeild delight vnto his soule further where parents leaue there maisters and tutours must take hold building vp that good foundation which is layde to their hand that by them also the streame of mans naturall imaginations may bee stopped yes though parents should neglect this dutie towards their owne children as too many doe at this day yet each godly master if hee desire to haue god church in his house must in struct his familie as gen abraha did and labour for circumcision of heart both to his children amp servant euen as gen abraham did circumcise not onely those that were borne in his familie but also those that were bought for money both parents and maisters are carefull to preuent diseases amp to breake off sicknes at the beginning in their children and servant which by continuance might bring bodily death oh then howe carefull ought they to bee to stop betime the course of naturall imagination in them which without the speciall grace of god will bring eternall condemnation both to soule and bodie and the rather must this course be taken in youth and that betime because custome whether in good or euill is a second nature for pso teach a child in the trade of his way and when he is old he will not depart from it but ier can the blacke moore change his skinne or the leopard her spots then may he also doe good that is accustomed to doe euill herein the vices of the minde are like the diseases of the body by longer continuance they grow more incurable yes all that studie and read the scriptures either for their owne priuate or for the publike good must seeke by prayer to god for the sanctification of their mindes from this euill corruption least beeing left vnto themselues they become vaine in their imaginations david a man according to god owne heart praied at least ten times in one psalm psalme for the teaching of god in the vnderstanding of his lawe oh then what great cause haue we so to doe whose coloss mindes are naturally set in euill workes beeing blinde in the things of god not corinthian able to perceiue them but on the contrary wholly prone to inuent and to embrace that which is euill the fourth amp last vse shall be for practise to euery child of god for if the imaginations of mans heart be euill from his youth then there must be repentance for secret thoughts which neuer come into action yes though we neuer giue consent of will thereto when ioell proclaimed a fast and called the people to humiliation hee biddes them ioel rent their he arts amp not their garments and peter said to simon magus act repent of this thy wickednes and pray god that if it be possible the thought of thy heart may bee forgiuen thee both which places doe plainly shewe that true repentance is not outward in change of speach or attire but inward in the change of the thoughts of the minde and affections of the heart and hence it is that paule prayeth for the thessalonians thes that they may be sanctified throughout in soule in bodie and spirit that is in the minde where is the framing of the thoughts nowe if sanctification bee required in the minde then must there be repentance of the sinnes that are therein this dutie the lord himselfe vouchsafeth to teach and therefore we must make conscience to learne and practise it if we would be truly turned to the lord and to mooue vs hereunto consider the reasons following first the curse of god euen the pangs and torments of the damned both in this life and after death are due to the person of man for his wicked thoughts for cursed is euery one saith deut moses that continueth not in all things that are written in the law to doe the so that hee which breaketh the law but once and that in thought only is accursed because he hath not done all things that are written therein now wicked thoughts are a breach of the law for salomon saith pro amp pro doe not they erre that imagine euill and againe the thoughts of the wicked are an abhomination to the lord yes the want of good thoughts is a breach of the law for christ mark saith thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy thought and therfore wicked thoughts must needes deserue this curse the fall of the deuills was most fearefull and irrecouerable amp though it be not certen yet most diuines agree in this that their sinne was first in thought and therefore wicked thoughts are deadly euills also to shew the wickednes of euill thoughts god hath set this brand vpon them since the fall of adam that by them not onely mans body but also his minde and memorie are far sooner confounded then by outward accidents this was not so by creation and therefore it is the heauie curse of god vpon them secondly these wicked thoughts be the roote and beginning of all uill in gesture word and deede there cannot be an action before there be a thought for this is the order whereby our actions are produced first the minde thinketh then that thought delighteth the affection and from that commeth consent of will after consent of will commeth execution of the action after executiou commeth trade and custome by often practise and vpon custome if the worke be euill commeth the curse which is eternall death how great a cause therefore haue we to repent vs of the wicked imaginations of our hearts the old world indeede was drowned for their actuall abhominations but no doubt the lord had great respect in that iudgement to their wicked thoughts which were the roote of all and therfore he mentioneth them as a cause of the flood gen in this repentance three things are required first a due examination of our heartr concerning these imaginations which we may take by the knowledge of those points before handled of mans naturall thoughts concerning god his neighbour amp himselfe and to further vs herein we must remember that all the euill thoughts before mentioned be in vs naturally so as if we be left to our selues when occasion is offered we will conceiue them in our mindes as that there is no god that the word of god is foolishnes ampc againe we must heare god word preached attentiuely amp apply not onely our outward senses but our mindes also thereto that so it may enter into our hearts for the word of god working in the heart will discouer vnto a man what be his thoughts this word saith the holy heb ghost is mightie inoperation and sharper then any two edged sword it entreth through euen to the deuiding a sunder of the soule and the spirits the ioynts and the marrow amp is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart at the preaching of this word the secrets of the heart of an infidell are discouered if all prophecie saith corinthian paul and there come in an infidell or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all man and iudged of all and so are the secrets of his heart made manifest whereupon he falleth downe and worshippeth god saying plainly god is in the prophets indeede secondly after examination wee must pray for the pardon of our euill thoughts a plaine commandement of this duty peter giues to symon magus act pray to god saith he that the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee and vndoubtedly he that hath not grace to pray for the pardon of his evill thoughts hath not true repentance in his heart thirdly we must seeke to reforme our minde of euill thoughts this is a further matter then reformation of life and it is expressely commanded by the holy ghost ephesian be ye renued in the spirit of your minds that is in the most inward and secret part of your soules euen where the thoughts and imaginations are framed and coceiued this duty must be remembred for christian religion consisteth not in outward shewes and behauiour though thereby we may giue comfortable testimony of god inward graces but it standes principally in the mind and in the heart which must therefore be reformed with the powers and faculties thereof for the reformation of our thoughts sundrie rules must be obserued first that we bring all our thoughts into the obedience of god euery man will grant that words and actions must be in subiection but i say further euery thought in the mind must be conceiued in obedience to god and no otherwaies salomon prov saith establish thy thoughts by counsell which may admit this meaning that a man must not conceiue a thought in his minde vnlesse he haue counsell and warrant from the word of god so to thinke and s paul saith corinthian the weapons of our warrefare speaking of the preaching of the gospell are not carnall but mightie through god to throw downe holds casting downe the imaginations and every thing that is exalted against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivitie euery thought to the obedience of christ giuing vs to vnderstand that those who submit themselues to the ministrie of the word must be of this mind not onely to be conformable therevnto in word and action but in every thought of their minde euen those must bowe the knee to christ howsoeuer with man we say thought is free yet with god it is not so and indeed he which hath effectually receiued the grace of christ will endeauour to yeild obedience as well in thought as in word and action whatsoeuer things are true saith phillip paul whatsoeuer things are honest whatsoeuer things are iust pure and pertaine to loue whatsoeuer things are of good report if there be any vertue if there be any praise he saith not onely doe v these things but thinke on these things where the commandement is plaine that a mans thoughts must be holy pure iust and of such things as are praiseworthy and of good report that so they may be conceiued in obedience to god the second rule for the reformation of our thoughts is giuen by salomon pro keepe or countergard thy heart aboue all watch and ward that is guard and keepe thy heart more the any thing that is watched or guarded whether citie house treasure or such like and the reason adioyned sheweth the necessities of the rule for out of it come the issues of life in the right guarding of the heart three duties must be performed first we must couenant with our outward senses resoluing fully with our selues by god grace that none of them shal be the instruments the beginning or occasion of any sinne in heart or life this couenant iob iob made with his eies not to looke vpon a maid to lust after her and david psalm prayed the lord to direct and keepe his eies from beholding vanitie now looke how these holy man dealt with their eyes so must wee proportionably deale for all the outward senses of our body bynding them all after their example from being the meanes of prouocation to any sinne this dutie is most necessarie for the outward senses be the doores amp windowes of the soule and vnlesse good care be had thereto the deuill will enter in by them and fill the soule with all corruption secondly we must obserue our euill thoughts and at their first arysing stop and restraine them not suffering them to take any place in our hearts this is a speciall meanes to preserue and guard the heart for fro the thoughts proceede all bad desires corrupt affections euill words amp actions the minde must first conceiue before the will can desire or the affections bee delighted or the members of the bodie practise any thing so that whatsoeuer is of a loose life and bad behauiour it commeth from the prophanesse of his heart in evill thoughts neither can it bee hoped that any man should reforme his life that will not guard his heart and keepe his mind from wicked imaginations the deuill cannot worke his will vpon mans affections or preuaile ouer mans will but by thoughts amp therefore it is necessarie that the first motions of euill in the minde bee restrayned at the beginning thirdly wee must with all care cherish and maintaine every good motion of god spirit that is caused in vs by the ministerie of the word or by the aduise of god children for these are the sparkes and flames of grace which paul meaneth when he saith thess quench not the spirit thirdly for the reformation of our thoughts wee must often vse eleuation of minde and heart to heauen where christ sitteth at the right hand of his father thus did dauid vnto thee psalm oh lord doe i lift vp my soule and paule saying of himselfe amp other christians philip that they had their conversation in heauen signifieth thus much that not onely their studies and meditations but also their dealings in the worlde were heauenly s iames iames bids vs drawe neere to god nowe which way should a poore wretch here below drawe neere to god but by lifting vp his heart to the throne of grace in heauen that so god in mercie may drawe neere vnto him by grace the lord hath instituted in his church the vse of his last supper wherein the giuing and receiuing of bread and wine doth represent and seale vp vnto vs our communion and participation of the bodie and blood of christ giuen for our redemption now the principall action on our behalfe therein required is this eleuation of the heart vnto god as well for the contemplation of god infinite mercie in christ amp of christs endlesse loue to vs as for the application of his merits to our owne soules by the hand of faith as also for the spirituall resignation of ourselues in soules and body by way of thankfulnes to him that hath redeemed vs further touching this eleuation wee must remember that it ought to be our continuall and ordinarie action vnto god for as it is with him that keepes a clocke vnlesse hee doe euery day winde vp the weights which are alwaies going downeward the clocke will stand so it fareth with vs our hearts are euer drawing towards the earth and the thinges heere below by reason of that bodie of sinne heb which hangeth on so fast and presseth downe and therefore wee must endeauour by god grace continually to lift them vp to heauen the apostle bids vs thess pray continually not that wee should doe nothing else but pray but his meaning is that wee should euery day and euery part of the day so oft as iust occasion is offered lift vp our hearts vnto god but of all other there be three especiall times wherein wee must vse this heauenly elevation first in the morning by prayer thankesgiuing or both before the cogitations of any earthly affaires come into our mindes that so we may giue vnto god the first fruits of our thoughts euery day secondly in the euening before wee lay downe our body to rest for who knoweth when hee layeth himselfe downe to sleepe whether euer hee shall rise againe aliue thirdly at any other time of the day wherein wee receiue any blessing from god temporall or spirituall or doe feele our selues to stand in neede of any of his gifts or graces for seeing euery good gift comes from him is it not reason we should giue this glorie to his name to lift vppe our hearts to his throne of grace whensoeuer wee receiue or expect the same from his bountifull hand fourthly for the reformation of our thoughts we must labour to be assured in our hearts by god spirite of our particular reconciliatio with god in christ this is that knowledge of the loue of god which passeth knowledge for which paule ephs bowed his knees vnto the father of our lord iesus christ in the behalfe of the ephesians in regarde hereof paul phillip estemed al things losse yes to bee drosse and donge nowe when this assurance is settled in our hearts it will purifie not onely the will and affections but also the first motions and thoughts of our mindes hee that hath in himselfe this hope saith ioh s john purifieth himselfe as god is pure for when a man shall bee truly perswaded in his heart that of a vile sinner euen the child of wrath he is made the child of god and a vessell of honour acceptable to god enioying his loue and fauour in christ then will hee reason thus with himselfe hath god of his endlesse mercie vouchsafed to receiue mee into his grace and fauour that otherwaies should haue beene a fyrebrand of hell for euermore oh then howe should i suffer my minde my will and affections to bee any longer the instruments of sin whereby i shall displease so gratious a god and cast my selfe out of his loue and fauour nay but i will imploy my soule which hee hath redeemed with all the powers and faculties thereof as weapons of righteousnes for the advancement of his glorie lastly if wee would reforme our thoughts wee must giue our selues to spirituall consideration or meditation by spirituall consideration i meane any action of the minde renued and sanctified whereby it doth seriously thinke on those things which may further saluation this consideration i call spirituall to distinguish it from earthly plotting care whereby naturall man shew themselues wise amp prouident for the thinges of this life though in the matters of god which concerne saluation they bee blinde and ignorant also i adde it must be an action of a minde renued and sanctified because the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of god they seeme foolishnes vnto him and therefore he cannot giue his minde vnto them nowe the excellent vse of this rule will plainly appeare by the fruitfull practise of it in the prophet dauid for what was more vsuall with him then spirituall and heauenly meditation sometime vpon ps god himselfe sometime ps on the workes of god sometime ps on his owne waies and ps continually on god word now sanctifying this dutie by praier as it is plaine hee did continually psalm let the meditation of my heart oh lord bee acceptable in thy sight hence it came to passe that hee professed an ps hatred vnto vaine inuentions which are the proper effects of an vnreformed minde and on the contrarie by this godly practise he ps got more vnderstanding the his teachers yes hee attained to this excellent state of a renued minde that ps his raines whereby hee meanes the most secret part of his soule taught him in the night season and in reason wee may perceiue the truth heereof for seeing contraries doe mutually expell one another what can be more effectuall to purge the minde of euill thoughts then to exercise the same with spirituall considerations for when through the blessing of god these shall take place the other must needes bee gone in regarde whereof it shall not be amisse somewhat to insist in the handling of them spirituall considerations seruing for the reformation of our thoughts doth either concerne god or our selues that which concerneth god containeth many branches but i will insist in foure especially first touching god presence wherby a man doth thinke and so resolue himselfe that wheresoeuer he is he stands before god and that all his thoughts wordes and deedes are naked in god sight dauids heart was filled with this consideration when he penned the psalme for that whole psalme from the beginning to the ende serueth to expresse this holy cogitation of god presence the like impression must wee labour to haue in our hearts touching god presence for it is the most notable meanes to cleanse the heart from euill thoughts to restraine the will and affections from wicked delights and to keepe in order the whole man causing him to stand in the awe of god commandements dauid saith psalm the feare of the lord is cleane meaning thereby that that man which hath the feare of god in his heart arising from this consideration of god presence hath a cleane and pure heart this consideration also is a notable meanes of comfort in the time of trouble and danger hence david psalm saith hough i walke through the valley of the shaddow of death i will feare none euill for the lord is with me and hence it was that psalm he would not be afraid for tenne thousand of the people that should rise vp against him the second consideration touching god is of his iudgements not onely those which were done of old and are recorded in the scripture or other history but euen his late iudgements which wee behold or heare to fall vpon kingdomes townes particular houses and persons must we carefully lay vnto our hearts of the want hereof the lord complaineth among his people saying ier the whole land lieth wast because no man setteth his minde on it giuing vs to vnderstand that the neglect of due consideration of god iudgement brought desolation to the whole land and therefore the want therof is a maine and grieuous sinne bringing further iudgements with it god hath sundry times sent his iudgements among vs generally by plague and famine and particularly on sundrie families and persons but who regardeth them wherefore vnlesse wee will double god iudgements vpon vs let vs remember our dutie and seriously thinke vpon them and that this consideration may be profitable vnto vs we must doe three things first we must carefully obserue marke and remember them psalm i remember thy iudgements of old o lord the lord people were much wanting therein as psalm secondly we must apply them to our owne person in particular so as the thought thereof may make vs afraid though they befall others when hab habakuck in a vision saw the iudgements of god which were to come vpon the chaldeans the consideration thereof was so powerfull with him that it made him tremble and quake in a familie when the father beateth his servant the child feareth and when one child is beaten then all the rest crie euen so when god our father powreth downe his iudgements though vpon the heathen yet wee must feare but when any of his children are afflicted it must strike soare to our hearts thirdly we must make vse of god iudgments that light vpon others by applying them to our selues when certaine man brought newes to our sauiour christ of an heauie iudgement vpon some luke galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their owne sacrifices immediately our saviour labours to bring them that told him to make vse thereof for their owne good saying that thereby they ought to be mooued to repentance for they that were slaine were no greater sinners then the rest and therefore except they who told that newes did amend their liues they should also perish so that whensoeuer we see or heare of any iudgement of god vpon others wee must thereby be mooued to repent and thus doing we shall come to a right consideration of god iudgements the third consideration concerning god is of his word dauid maketh it the propertie of a blessed man ps to meditate in the law of god day and night and he professeth of himselfe that ps it was his meditation continually yes oftentimes he promiseth to v meditate in god precepts to v delight in god statutes this is luke maries praise that shee kept in her heart sundrie things which iesus spake and so ought euery child of god high or low daily and continually to meditate in the word of god but alas this dutie is little knowne and lesse practised man are so farre from meditating in god word that they are ignorant of it among many families you shall scarse finde the booke of god and such as haue it for the most part doe little vse it the statutes of the land are by very many searched out diligently but in the meane time the statutes of the lord are litle regarded oh that man knew the sweete comfort rom of the scriptures then certenly they would account their meditation therein ier the ioy and reioycing of their heart now the right consideration of god word consists in three things first we must obserue the true sense and meaning of that which wee heare or read secondly we must marke what experience we haue had of the truth of the word in our owne persons as in the exercises of repentance amp inuocation of god name and in all our temptations this is a speciall point in this meditation without which the former is nothing thirdly we must consider how farre forth we haue beene answerable to god word in obedience and wherin we haue beene defectiue by transgressions againe in the word of god there bee both commandements and promisses the consideration of god commandements is a notable meanes to direct amp moderate not onely our words and deedes but also our secret thoughts and desires for if before we thinke before we will or speake any thing we would first consider that god comands vs to think to will and speake thus and thus this would mightily stay and suppresse in vs all corrupt thoughts and desires all euill words and actions the promisses of god likewise duly cosidered would greatly further vs in good thoughts for to them that think on good things shall be mercie and truth prov the cause then why many that know the will of god so much faile in particular obedience is because that with their knowledge they doe not ioyne this serious consideration of god commandements and promisses and apply the same to their occasions the fourth consideration cocerning god is of his workes for as dauid saith psalm the workes of the lord are great and ought to be sought out of all that loue him this consideration bindeth vs to enquire and search what be the workes of god toward vs his worke of creation his providence preseruation with all other his workes of mercie and iustice in vs and vpon vs whether ordinary or extraordinary the prophet esay isay denounceth a woe against those that had the harpe and vyoll timbrell and pype and wine in their feasts and regarded not the worke of god nor considered the worke of his hands whereby we may see that the neglect hereof is a grieuous sinne and yet it is the commo sinne of this age now for the better performance of this dutie wee must thus proceede first we must consider our creation how the lord gaue vs being when we were nothing and how he made vs reasonable creatures amp not brute beast yes he created vs in his owne image when as he might if it had so pleased him haue made vs toades amp serpents secondly we must consider his good providence ouer vs howe he hath preserved our life from time to time and saued vs from many dangers and his great patience must not be forgotten how he hath spared vs from the righteous iudgements of our sinnes hee might haue cast vs into hell in our mothers wombe or so soone as wee were borne for our originall sinne but hee hath giuen vs a large time of repentance heere also wee must consider his exceeding fauour in the time and place of our birth and life hee might haue suffered vs to haue beene borne among infidel but behold wee were borne in the bosome of god church hee might haue depriued vs of the meanes of our saluation his holie worde and sacraments but in his tender mercie hee hath vouchsafed them vnto vs to bring our soules to life hee might haue isay hardned our hearts against his feare and blinded our eies against his light rom but yet he hath enlightned our mindes to knowe his truth and softned our hearts causing vs to crie vnto him for the pardon of our sinne he might haue rom giuen vs vp to a reprobate sense when wee swerued from his testimonies and reguarded not the knowledge of his will but loe as a louing father he hath often heb chastened vs for our profit that wee might bee partakers of his holines hee might haue left vs comfortles vnder the reproch of the wicked but hee hath vouchsafed vs his spirit for our euerlasting comforter thus must we dulie consider of all these wonderfull workes of god towardes vs and not like the man of this world thinke on nothing but pastimes honours and commodity this will bee a notable meanes to keepe our hearts from euill thoughtes for whose heart will not relent towards his god that so many waies hath tasted of his bountie towardes him yes this consideration will bee an exceeding stay and comfort to our soules in the daie of trouble and distresse so salomon saith ecles beholde the worke of god and in the day of affliction consider a naturall man cannot away with trouble if sorrowes encrease vpon him hee is readie to make away himselfe which comes of this that he can not consider the workes of god for he that can rightly meditate on god goodnesse towards him in all his workes shall be able with patience to support his soule vnder the greatest crosse a practise heereof we may see in dauid who being in a most greeuous temptation so as he cried out psalm is the lord mercie cleane gone hath he forgotten to be mercifull ampc did yet recouer himselfe by the consideration of god former workes of mercie and of his v wonders of old whereof he had experience in his owne person the considerations which respect our selues are six first we must cosider our owne personall sinnes as well the corruptions of our hearts as the actuall transgressions of our liues this was dauids practise psalm i considered my waies saith hee and turned my feete into thy testimonies the iewes likewise in their great affliction stirred vp themselues to this dutie saying one to another lam come let vs search and trie our waies and turne againe vnto the lord in this consideration of our sinnes wee must doe three things first seriouslly call to minde in what manner wee haue sinned whether of ignorance or of knowledge of weaknesse through infirmitie or of wilfulnesse through presumption secondly we must dulie waighe the greatnes of our particular sinnes euen of the least of them remembring this that by euery sinne wee commit god infinite maiestie is displeased and his iustice violated thirdly wee must consider the number of our sinnes which wee shall neerest attaine vnto by searching out our thoughts our wills amp affections our words amp actions all which being diligently obserued will make vs crie out that they bee in number as the haires of our head and the sands by the sea shoare quest but what if a man haue truely repented him of his sinnes must he still vse this cosideration of them answer yes verily although he bee assured of the pardon of them so did dauid after nathan tould him thy sinnes are forgiuen hee penned the psalme and when hee was high in god fauour he prayed still for the psalm pardon of the sinnes of his youth for howsoeuer god in mercie put our sinnes out of his remembrace vpon our true repentance yet we must neuer put them out of our remembrance so long as we liue in this world because the consideration of them though they bee pardoned is a notable meanes both to mooue vs to renewe our repentance and also to make vs watchfull against sinne in time to come secondly wee must consider the miserie into which euery one is plunged by nature through adams fall and his owne sinnes this was iobs meditation saying iob man that is borne of a woman hath but a short time to liue he is full of miserie and so goeth on most notably describing the miserie of man yes this was salomons consideration in the whole book of ecclesiastes from the beginning to the end nowe that this consideration may take place in our hearts wee must enter into a particular view of this our naturall miserie the principall branches whereof bee these first a separation from all fellowship with god for as isai isa saith our sinnes haue separated betweene god and vs and this is the speciall part of mans miserie secondly societie and fellowship with the damned spirits the deuill and all his angels standing in this that man by nature beareth the image of the deuill and withall performeth seruice vnto him in the practise of lying iniustice crueltie and all manner of sinne thirdly all manner of calamities in this life as ignominie in good name paines and diseases in the bodie losses and damages in friends and in all temporall blessings whatsoeuer fourthly the horrour of a guiltie conscience which is in it selfe the beginning of hell torments for it is our accuser vnto god our iudge to giue sentence against vs and the very hang man of our soules to condemne vs eternally fiftly the second death which is the full apprehension of the eternall furie of god wrath both in bodie and soule eternally this consideration must be often vsed of euery man to mooue him to repentance and it is very effectuall thereunto for if we doe but consider howe a man for the paine of one tooth will be so grieued that hee could wish with all his heart to be out of the worlde that his paine were ended oh then how great shal we think the apprehension of the full wrath of god to bee seazing not vpon one little member but vpon the whole man both bodie and soule amp that for euer no tongue can expresse nay no heart can conceiue the greatnes of this terrour and therefore it must be an occasion both to beginne and encrease true repentance in vs dailie thirdly wee must consider our owne particular temptations wherewith wee are most assaulted through the malice of sathan and our owne corruption bee sober and watch saith pet peter for your aduersarie the deuill goeth about like a roaring lyon seeking whome he may deuoure this was paules practise towards the incestuous man whom hee had enioyned to bee excommunicate for after he heard of his repentance hee gaue direction that hee should bee receiued into the church againe least hee were swallowed vp of ouer much heauines and so sathan should circumvent them for saith corinthian amp hee wee are not ignorant of his enterprise if foreign enemy should seeke the invasion of our land not onely our magistrates but euerie ordinarie man well affected to his countrey would bethinke himselfe what coast were the weakest that thether present defence might bee sent to keep out the enemy euen so seeing the deuill doth assault vs daily wee must enter into serious consideration of our thoughts wills and affections and see in what part we bee most weake and in what inclination satan may most easily preuaile against vs which we shall best espie by obseruing the sinnes of our liues and this will make vs arme our selues against him by god grace euen in the weakest parts that hee breake not into our hearts to the ruine of our soules this consideration concerneth all man not onely the dissolute and sinnefull but euen those that haue receiued most grace it were infinite to goe through all the temptations of satan consider this one for all whereby he kills many a soule through the whole course of mens liues he laboureth to fill their hearts with carnall securitie and to bring them to neglect the ordinary meanes of saluation this done he seekes to keepe them in this estate all their life long but in the end he takes an other course for when death approcheth then he seekes to strike their mindes with obliuion of god mercies and to fill their soules with terrours in regard of their sinnes and of god iudgements due vnto them that so bereauing them of all hope of mercie he may bring them to finall despaire wee therefore beeing forewarned of his deadly fraud must seriously bethinke our selues of this temptation and cast with our selues euery day how to auoide it this we shall doe if we shake off carnall securitie and negligence in the meanes of our saluation and prouide betimes for the assurance of god loue and fauour that when death shall come wee may be free from the terrour of an euill conscience amp haue strong hope and consolation in christ iesus fourthly we must consider our particular ende the lord complaineth of the want hereof in his owne people deut oh that they were wise then would they consider this they would consider their latter end in this consideration three points must be obserued first that the time of death is vncertaine no man knoweth when he must dye secondly that the place is vncertaine no man knoweth where he must dye thirdly that the manner of his death is vncertaine none knoweth by what death he shall glorifie god and therefore that we may not deceiue our selues wee must thinke that most fearefull and greivous ends may befall vs in regard of the bodily payne and torment eue then when we little feare or suspect any such thing this consideration will bee a notable meanes to stirre vp our hearts either to beginne or renew our repentance when wicked king ahab heard of his fearefull end hee was humbled and the ninivites beeing told of their sudden destructio ionah repented in sackcloath and ashes and turned to the lord fiftly we must often consider with our selues and that most seriously of that straight account and reckoning of all our thoughts words and actions which we must make vnto god at the last day of iudgement this is the principall consideration of all and the want hereof a fearfull sinne arguing great negligence ignorance blyndnes of mind and hardnes of heart if a traveller come into an inne hauing but one penny in his purse and call for all manner of dainty fare and prouision spending sumptuously will not al man iudge him void of all consideration since he hath nothing to pay when his account is to bee made loe this or worser is the most mens case who in this life pursue their profit and pleasures with all eagernes they care not how neuer regarding that reckonning which they must make vnto god at his terrible day of accounts with all the world and therefore though the former cosiderations will not yet let this take place in our hearts to mooue vs to a daily forehand reckonning with god in the practise of true repentance and to imploy the good gifts and blessings we receiue from god like good servant vnto the best advantage of his glorie that when this account is to be made we may giue it with ioy and not with feare and that this consideration is effectuall to this purpose salomon teacheth in vsing it as his farewell with dissolute youth with whome otherwaies he hath little hope to preuaile saying ecclesiast goe too thou young man take thy pleasure in thy youth yet know that for all this thou must come to iudgement but how powerfull it is with god child we may see in paul act who professeth of himselfe that in regard of this account he endeauoured to haue alway a cleere conscience towards god and towards man lastly we must seriously consider of our present estate towards god whether we be in the state of sinne or in the state of grace whether we belong to the kingdome of darkenes or be true members of the kingdome of christ it is not enough to bee in the church but we must be sure we be of the church for many wolues and goates be in god fould they went out from vs saith s john iohn but they were not of vs and therefore paul adviseth to this consideration saying corinthian prooue your selues whether you bee in the faith or not the want hereof was the fearefull sinne of the foolish virgin mat who contented themselues with a shew of religion hauing the blasing lampes of outward profession and laboured not for that oyle of true grace which might enlighten their soules to the fruition of god glorie yes this is the common sinne of this age man blesse themselues in their good meaning saying they hope well and doe not through search whether they be true members of god church or not now if after tryall it appeare that true faith and repentance be wanting in vs which are the seales of adoption in god children then with all good conscience we must vse the meanes appointed of god to obteine these graces for our assurance the comfort whereof will be so pretious vnto our soules that we shall abhor to admit such wicked imaginations into our minds as any way tend to depriue vs of it these are the considerations which respect our selues whereunto if we giue our mindes in a constant course as also to the former which concerne the lord obseruing withall the rules before prescribed through god blessing vpon our endeauour wee shall vndoubtedly finde by good experience that euill thoughts shall not preuaile against vs but beeing reformed in our cogitations we shall send out of our mindes as from a cleansed fountaine such streames of good words and works through the whole course of our liues as shall redound to the glorie of our god the good of our brother and the consolation of our owne soules through iesus christ our lord to whome with the father and the holy ghost be praise in his church for euermore amen

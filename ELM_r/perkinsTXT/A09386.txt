predestination is the counsell of god touching the last end or estate of man out of this temporall or natural life for as touching natural life we are all alike and this kind of life is in the counsell of god onely a preparation and step vnto the spirituall and heauenly life the supreme end of predestination is the manifestation of god glorie partly in his mercie and partly in his iustice and this hath bin the doctrin of the fathers s austen saith that one of those two societies of man which wee mystically call two cities is that which is predestinated to raigne eternally with god and the other to suffer eternall punishment with the diuell fulgentius saith also that in god predestination there is prepared either a mercifull remission of sins or a iust punishing and gregorie saith that god being a iust creator vnto all after an admirable manner hath foreelected some and forsaken others in their corruptions and the more learned schoolemen vse to say that god for the more full manifestation of his perfection hath predestinated some in manifesting his goodnes by the rule of mercie and damned others in representing his perfection by the rule of iustice the common meanes of accomplishing this counsell is two fold the creation and the permission of the fall creation is that by which god made y e whole man of nothing according to his owne image but yet changeable and endued with a naturall life the permission of the fall is whereby god did iustly suffer adam and his posteritie to fall away in that he did not hinder them when he was able as being indeed bound to none to hinder and god is said not to hinder euill when he ceaseth after a sort from his operation not illuminating the minde and not inclining the will to obey his voyce this permission of the euill of fault is by god foreknowledge and will but yet only for the greater good of all which would bee hindred if god did not suffer euill for if there were not sinne there should bee no place for the patience of martyrs and for the sacrifice of christ offered vpon the crosse which doth infinitely exceede all the sinne of the whole world augustine saith well god hath iudged it better to doe good with euils than to permit no euill to be in like manner gregorie saith in his seuere iudgement he suffereth euill to be done but withall he doth in mercie forecast what good things he may bring to passe by these euils which hee doth ordaine by his iudgement for what greater sinne is there than that by which we doe all die and what greater goodnesse than that by which we are deliuered from death and doubtlesse but that adam sinned our redeemer should not haue taken our flesh vpon him whiles god was to be borne man the almightie did foresee that hee would make of that euill for which they were to die a good which should be greater than that euill the greatnesse of which good what faithfull man is there who doth not see how wonderfully it doth excell surely great are the euils which we suffer by the desert of the first fault but what faithfull man would not rather endure worse than to be without so great a redeemer and in this respect elsewhere he calleth the fall of adam foelicem culpam a happie fault that which i haue said of the permission of the fall i doe also say of the fall permitted sauing that the permission is a meanes of the decree by it selfe but the fall is a meanes of accomplishing the decree onely by the ordination of god who draweth good out of euill this fall permitted commeth not to passe but god being willing neither doth it come to passe contrariwise or otherwise than god permitteth neither can it any further be than hee doth permit yet the will of god is not the cause of the fall but the will of man left vnto it selfe by god and moued by the suggestion of sathan which will appeare by this similitude i build a house subiect to change and falling which notwithstading would continue many yeeres if it might bee free from the annoyance of windes yes if i would but vnderprop it when the storme commeth it would continue stable but as soone as the windes begin to rage i do not vnderprop it and it is my will not to vnderprop it because it is my pleasure so to doe thereupon the house being weatherbeaten falleth downe i see the fall and in part i will it because now when i could very easily haue hindred the fall yet i would not and although thus farre i doe will the fall in so much as it is my will not to hinder it yet the cause of the fall is not to be imputed vnto me that did not vnderproppe it but to the winds which cast it downe so god leauing adam vnto himselfe that hee might be prooued by tentation and that it might appeare what the creature is able to doe the creator ceasing for a time to helpe and guide is not to bee accounted the cause of this fall for he did not encline the minde to sinne hee did not infuse any corruption neither did he withdraw any gift which he did bestow in the creation onely it pleased him to deny or not to conferre confirming grace the proper cause of the fall was the diuell attempting our ouerthrow and adams will which when it began to bee prooued by tentations did not desire god assistance but voluntarilie bent it selfe to fall away predestination hath two parts the decree of election and the decree of reprobation so isidore saith there is a double predestination either of the elect vnto rest or of the reprobate vnto death and both are done by god that he might make the elect alwaies to follow after heauenly and spirituall things and that he might suffer the reprobate by for saking them to bee delighted alwaies with earthly and outward things and angelome saith christ by his secret dispensation hath out of an vnfaithfull people predestinated some to cuerlasting liberty quickning them of his free mercie and damned others in euerlasting death in leauing them by his hidden iudgement in their wickednes the decree of election is that whereby god hath ordained certaine man to his glorious grace in the obtaining of their saluation and heauenly life by christ in the decree of election according to god determination there is as wee conceiue a double act the former concernes the end the latter concernes the meanes tending to the end this the holy ghost seemeth to me to haue taught very euidentlie rom that the purpose which is according to election might remain heere wee see that paul distinguisheth god eternall purpose and election and placeth in his decree a certaine election in the first place before the purpose of damning or sauing and in rom the those which he knew before he also predestinated to bee made like to the image of his sonwhom he predestinated them also he called in which wordes paul distinguisheth betwene the decree and the execution thereof which he maketh to bee in these three vocation iustification and glorification moreouer he distinguisheth the decree into two acts foreknowledge whereby hee doth acknowledge some man for his owne before the rest and predestination whereby he hath determined from eternitie to make them like vnto christ in like manner peter teacheth pet where hee saith that the faithful are elected according to the foreknowledg of god the father vnto sanctification of the spirit if any man shall say that by foreknowledge in these places wee must vnderstand as many would the foreknowledge or foreseeing of future faith he is manifestly deceiued for whom god foreknew them hee did predestinate that they should bee like to christ that is that they should bee made iust and the sonnes of god for paul addeth rom that he might be the first borne among many brother but those which are predestinated to be iust and to be the sonnes of god are also predestinated to beleeue because adoption and righteousnes are receiued by faith now we cannot rightly say that god doth first foreknow that man will beleeue and afterwards predestinate the to beleeue because that god hath therfore foreknowne that those shall beleeue whom hee did foreknow would beleeue because hee did decree that they should beleeue so iustin martyr calleth those elect who were foreknowne that they should beleeue and lumbard whom hee hath foreknowne them he hath predestinated that is by grace conferred hee hath prepared that they should beleeue the word preached moreouer the word know when it is giuen vnto god speaking of the creature doth very often signifie to imbrace or approue psalm the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked shall perish matth depart from me yee workers of iniquitie i neuer knew you furthermore the prescience amp purpose of god are by the holy ghost put for one and the same thing tim the foundation of god remaineth surethe lord knoweth who are his rom those whom god foreknew are said to be elected according to the election of grace verse and therefore the foreknowledge mentioned by paul doth not signifie the foreknowledge of faith or of any other vertue in those which were to bee elected it is also the iudgement of augustine that predestination is sometimes vnderstood by prescience euen in the foresaid place hath god cast away his people which hee knew before and he saith that those are sonnes in god foreknowledge whose names are written in their fathers register so as they shall neuer be raised out cyrill saith also that christ knoweth his sheepe electing and foreseeing them vnto euerlasting life as the apostle saith rom god hath not cast away his people which hee knew before for as the lord is said not to know those whom he doth reiect as when he answered the foolish virgin saying matth verilie i say vnto you i know you not so hee is said to know those whom he doth predestinate and fore appoint vnto saluation and thomas expoundeth that place in the to the romanes after this sort whom he foreknew in his knowledge of approbation these he hath also predestinated and he will also haue an effectuall will of conferring grace to bee included in the knowledge of approbation in the decree of election the first act is a purpose or rather a part and beginning of the diuine purpose whereby god doth take certaine man which are to be created vnto his euerlasting loue and fauour passing by the rest and by taking maketh them vessels of mercie and honour and this act is of the sole will of god without any respect either of good or euill in the creature and god doth wrong none although hee chuse not all because hee is tied to none amp because he hath absolute soueraigntie and authoritie ouer all creatures we that are but man giue leaue vnto man especially vnto our friends to do at their pleasure in many things as they themselues list and to vse their owne discretions the rich man is kinde to which poore person hee pleaseth and of beggers he doth adopt one and will not adopt another and that without offring any iniurie now that libertie which wee yeeld vnto man must much more bee granted vnto god the second act is the purpose of sauing or conferring glorie whereby hee doth ordaine or set apart the very same man which were to fall in adam vnto saluation and celestiall glorie this act is in no wise to be seuered from the former but to be distinguished in the minde for orders sake and for the better vnfolding of it for as by the former man were ordained vnto grace so by this latter the meanes are subordained whereby grace may be conferred and manifested and therefore this latter maketh a way for the execution and accomplishing of the former moreouer this act hath no impulsiue cause ouer and beside the good pleasure of god and it is with regard to christ the mediatour in whom all are elected to grace and saluation and to dreame of any election out of him is against all sense because hee is the foundation of election to bee executed in regard of y e beginning the meanes and the end lastly this act is not of man to bee created as was the former but of man falne away therfore in this act god respecteth the corrupted masse of mankind furthermore in this second act there are fiue degrees the ordaining of a mediatour the promising of him being ordained the exhibiting of him being promised the applying of him being exhibited or to bee exhibited and the accomplishment of the application it is not vnlike which bernard saith the kingdome of god is granted promised manifested perceiued it is granted in predestination promised in vocation manifested in iustification perceiued or receiued in glorification the ordaining of a mediatour is that whereby the second person being the son of god is appointed from all eternitie to bee a mediatour betweene god himselfe and man and hence it is that peter saith that christ was foreknowne before the foundation of the world and well saith augustine that christ was predestinated to be our head for howsoeuer as he is the substantiall word of the father or the son he doth predestinate with the father and the holy ghost yet as hee is the mediatour hee is predestinated himselfe the promising is that whereby christ being from eternitie ordained for the saluation and spirituall life of man is reuealed and offred vnto them together with grace to be obtained by him this promise is vniuersall in respect of all and euery one that doe beleeue ioh god so loued the world that he hath giuen his onely begotten son that euery one that beleeueth in him should not perish ioh hee that beleeueth in me hath life euerlasting matth come vnto me all yes that are wearie and laden and i will ease you mark he that shall beleeue and bee baptised shal be saued but he that will not beleeue shall be damned act that thorough his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes act by him euery one that beleeueth is iustified rom the gospell is the power of god to saluation to euery one that beleeueth rom christ is the end of the law for righteousnes vnto euery one that beleeueth gal the scripture hath concluded all vnder sin that the promise by the faith of iesus christ should be giuen to them that beleeue with the promise there is ioyned an exhortation or commandement to beleeue which is more generall than the promise because the promise is made onely to beleeuers but the commandement is giuen to beleeuers and vnbeleeuers also for the elect are mingled with the wicked in the same assemblies and therefore the ministers of the gospell ought indifferently to exhort all and euery one to repent considering that they are altogether ignorant who and how many be elected and be to be conuerted moreouer god by exhortations to repentance meaneth to leaue those without excuse whom he doth see will neuer repent so abbat ioachim saith it behooueth them to preach for the elects sake and to declare vnto man the words of life that their light may shine before man and that they may fatten the hearts of the elect by anoynting them with the oyle of spirituall doctrine but for the reprobate ligare aquam coelo to the water in the clowdes and againe lest the reprobate should haue excuse and for the elect which are among them the messenger himselfe shall bee sent who doth not onely preach this in secret as it were for feare but crieth also with a loude voyce which may bee heard farre off and of all man also some are wont to say that god commandement by this meanes doth ouerthwart his decree because he commandeth that which he willeth not to effect but i answere first that god in his commandements and promises doth not vtter whatsoeuer hee hath decreed but doth in part onely so farre forth propound his will as he knoweth it expedient for the saluation of the elect and the gouerning of all by his commandements therefore he sheweth what he liketh and what hee willeth that we should doe to him not what hee will doe to vs or in vs and god who willeth not all things alike in all doth will conuersion in some only in respect of approbation exhortation and meanes in others he willeth it also as touching the decree of working it here is no disagreement in the wils but sundrie degrees of willing in regard of vs according to which god is said both to will and to nill secondly i answere that the reuealed will is neuer contrarie to the will of his good pleasure or to the decree of god with the which it doth alwaies agree both for the beginning as also in the end and scope but that it is notwithstanding often diverse and that in shew it seemeth sometimes contrarie if wee consider the manner wherein it is propounded god commanded isaiah to declare vnto hezekiah his death and hee did also denounce destruction vnto the niniuites within fourtie daies and yet he had decreed to put neither of them both in execution the humane wil of christ did with an holy dissention in some sort will deliuerance from the agony of death which notwithstading the diuine willed not abraham prayed without doubt by diuine inspiration amp therefore with faith that the sodomites might be spared and yet he knew that in god decree they were appointed to destruction neither must this seeme strange for one good thing as it is and remaineth good may bee different from another thing that is good thirdly thou biddest thy debter pay his debt though in the meane time thou dost not make him able why may not god therfore for iust causes command that which he himselfe will not do the exhibiting of the mediator is that whereby the son of god being borne man in the fulnes of time doth pay the price of redeption to god for the sins of man the vertue and efficacie of this price being paid in respect of merit and operation is infinite but yet it must be distinguished for it is either potentiall or actuall the potentiall efficacie is wherby the price is in it selfe sufficient to redeeme euery one without exception from his sins albeit there were a thousand worlds of man but if we consider that actuall efficacie the price is payd in the counsell of god and as touching the euent only for those which are elected and predestinated for the son doth not sacrifice for those for whom hee doth not pray because to make intercession and to sacrifice are conioyned but hee prayeth onely for the elect and for beleeuers ioh and by praying he offereth himselfe to his father verse for as illyricus hath well obserued this whole prayer in the chapter is indeed as he speaketh an oblatory and expiatory prayer or as the papists call that blasphemous forme a canon or rule of sacrifice by which christ hath offered himselfe a sacrifice to the father for the sinnes of the world therefore the price is appointed and limited to the elect alone by the fathers decree and the son intercession and oblation secondly christ bare their person and stood in their roome vpon the crosse for whom he is a mediator and consequently whatsoeuer christ did as a redeemer the same did all those in him amp with him which are redeemed christ dying rising again ascending amp sitting at the right hand of the father they also die with him rise againe ascend and sit at the right hand of god now that all these things can be truly said of the elect only and of such as beleeue i proue it thus to say that any one of the wicked which are to perish for euer is raised vp in christ rising againe is flat against the truth because the raysing vp of christ is that i may so speake his actuall absolution from their sins for whom he died for euen as the father by deliuering christ to death did in very deede condemne their sins imputed vnto christ for whom he died so by raysing him vp from death euen ipso facto he did absolue christ from their sinnes and did withall absolue them in christ but being absolued from their sins they shall not perish but be saued therefore that wicked man which perisheth for his sin cannot be said to haue risen againe with christ and therefore christ did not beare his person vpon the crosse thirdly the expiatory sacrifice sanctifieth those for whom it is a sacrifice as the holie ghost plainly and absolutely auoucheth heb the sacrifice and sanctification appertaine to the same persons and christ is their perfect sauiour whom he saueth not only by meriting their saluation but also by working it effectually but christ doth sanctifie only the elect and such as beleeue therefore he was a sacrifice only for them and this was the iudgment of the ancient church in this point augustine saith he which spared not his owne son but gaue him for vs all how hath he not also with him giuen vs all good things but for what vs for vs which are foreknown predestinated iustified and glorified againe those whom he pleased to make his brother he hath released and made fellow heires cyril saith if god who is most worthy was in the flesh he was of right sufficient to redeeme the whole world againe the lord iesus separating his owne from those which were not his saith i pray only for those which keepe my word and cary my yoke for he doth make them alone and that iustly partakers of the benefit of his mediation whose mediator and high priest he is gregorie saith the author of life gaue himselfe to death for the life of the elect againe the lord will redeeme the soules of his servant to wit with his precious blood because he which beleeueth rightly in him is redeemed from the due thraldome of his sins sedulius all things are restored which are in the earth or when seeing that the man themselues who are predestinated vnto eternall life are renewed from the corruption of the old man beda the flesh of the lord is furnished with spirituall vertue that it might be a sweet sauor sufficient for the saluation of the whole world againe our lord and redeemer to the elect whom he knew to be placed in his flesh yes and to vs also whom he foresaw should beleeue in the last times he hath procured the remedie of saluation by his death and resurrection ioachim the abbat the word all which for the most part is vniuersall doth not alwaies signifie so much as it seemeth as in that place when i shall be lift vp i will draw all things to my selfe and by him he hath pleased that all things should be reconciled in him it seemeth that in these places elect things onely are vnderstood angelomus what other nation is there in the earth besides the elect people for which god the son of god vouchsafed to come into this world as it were into egypt that taking vpon him the forme of a servant he might with the merchandize of his blood redeeme vnto himselfe an acceptable people zealous of good workes ruper us in that houre he washed those only from sin whom his death findeth faithfull whether dead or liuing againe the passion of christ is the iudgement of the world that is saluation seuering the whole number of the elect which were from the beginning of the world to the houre of the same passion from the reprobate and the casting out of the prince of this world is the reconciliation of the nation of the elect againe i will draw all things to my selfe what all things namely all elect things as all the members follow their head haimo christ hath taken away in the elect not onely originall but all actuall sins also and hath ouer and besides giuen them eternall life radulphus the blood of the high priest christ was the purgation of all beleeuers innocentius christ blood was shed effectually for those only who are predestinated but for all man in regard of sufficiencie for the shedding of the blood of that iust one for the vniust was so rich in price that if euery one had beleeued in the redeemer none at all had been held captiue of the diuell arnoldus carnotensis he redeemeth none but those whom he calleth and washeth by grace neither doth the spirit sanctifie any but those who are cleansed and dead to sinne redemption washing away and sanctification are partakers together the application is when as christ is giuen vnto vs of god the father by the spirit in the lawful vse of the word and sacraments and is receiued of vs by the instrument of a true faith and christ being giuen is made vnto vs of god wisdome righteousnes sanctification and redemption the accomplishment of the application is glorification whereby god shal be all in all by christ in all the elect by this which hath been said it is apparent that the decree of election is the cause and foundation of all good giftes and workes in man from hence is true faith act as many as were ordained vnto eternall life beleeued and calling rom whom he predestinated them he called and who are called of his purpose hence adoption ephesians predestinated to adoption and sanctification ephesians he hath chosen vs that we should be holie and blamelesse hence good workes ephesian which he hath prepared that we should walke in them and perseuerance ioh all that the father giueth me shall come vnto me and him that commeth to me i cast not away againe and this is the fathers will that of all which he hath giuen me i should lose nothing tim the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord know te who are his excellent is that saying of augustine he did choose no man worthie but by chusing he made him worthie againe it is the grace of god whereby he doth elect me not because any worthines is in me but because it doth vouchsafe to make me worthie againe and did not they also afterwa ds chuse him and preferre him before all the good things of this life but they did chuse him because they were chosen they were not chosen because they chused him and thus much of the decree of election the decree of reprobation is a worke of god prouidence whereby he hath decreed to passe by certaine man in regard of supernaturall grace for the manifestation of his iustice and wrath in their due destruction or it is his will whereby he suffreth some man to fall into sinne and inflicteth the punishment of condemnation for sinne it hath in like manner two actes the first is the purpose to forsake some man and to make knowen his iustice in them this act hath a finall cause but no impulsiue cause out of god for it ariseth of god meere good pleasure no respect had of good or euill in the creature for the will of god is the cause of causes therfore we must make our stand in it and out of or beyond it no reason must be sought for yes indeed there is nothing beyond it moreouer euery man as paul auerreth is vnto god as a lumpe of clay in the potters hand and therefore god according to his supreme authoritie doth make vessels of wrath he doth not find them made but hee should not make them but find them made if we say that god willed in his eternall counsell to passe by man only as they are sinners and not as they are man for causes most iust though vnknowen to vs thirdly if god did reiect man because he foresaw that they would reiect him reprobatio should not depend vpon god but vpon man themselues and this is all one as if a man should say that god foresaw that some would chuse him and others refuse him and the contempt of the gospell doth not befall infants which die out of the couenant of the gospell fourthly paul who was a most skilful defender of god iustice doth exclude all workes in the first place out of this wonderfull election of one from another made in the counsell of god not by worke saith he and therefore excludeth all respect of sinne then afterwards being rauished with admiration he quieteth himselfe in the alone will of god who hath resisted his will but o man who article thou which pleadest against god againe o the deepenes of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of god how vnsearchable are his iudgments and his waies past finding out to conclude if it be demaunded why god created this world and no more we must haue recourse he meere will of god and why must we not doe so if it be demaunded why god electeth this man and forsaketh that man or another author de vec gent a part of mankinde is redeemed a part perisheth but who can tell why god doth not pity them and pitieth these the reason of the distinction is vnknowen but the distinction or separation it selfe is not knowen the second act is the ordaining of them to punishment or due destruction this ordination in respect of the diverse consideration thereof may be distinguished and so it is either simple or comparatiue the simple ordination is that wherby this man suppose peter or john is ordained to punishment and this ordination is of the most iust will of god yet not without respect of originall and actuall sinnes for as man are actually damned for sin so god hath decreed to damne them for the same sinne yet notwithstanding sin is not the cause of the decree of reprobation but in regard of order it goeth before in god fore knowledge not that former but this latter act the ordination which stands in comparison is that whereby one man and not another and this man rather then that being in the like condition is ordeined to punishment this serueth to shew the libertie of god will in the dispensation of supernaturall benefits for in that god chuseth this man and not that it declareth the libertie and very great perfection of god and therefore vnder the name of an housholder he challengeth the same vnto himselfe when he saith may i not do with my own what i list and verely though god destroy and condemne all those whom he doth forsake yet should he not be iniust for we our selues in the daily killing and slaughtering of beast will not be counted vniust neither indeed are we and yet in comparison of god we are not so much worth as a flie is in respect of vs if it be lawful for thee to receine in or to thrust out any out of thine house because thou wilt it were a point of desperate boldnes to take the same right from god in his house the cause of this comparatiue ordination is the sole wil of god yes euen without respect of any sinne at all so augustine god deliuereth no man but of his free mercy and condemneth no man but m st righteously now why he deliuereth this man rather then that let him search who can diue into the great depth of his iudgements againe why is it thus to this man and otherwise to this o man who article thou that thou darest dispute with god and gregorie let no man desire to search wherefore one should bee elected when another is reiected because his iudgements are vnsearchable and his waies past finding out in this second act of reprobation there be two degrees a iust desertion or forsaking amp damnation for sinne so fulgentius in such saith he god begins his iudgement by forsaking and ends it in ormenting diuine desertion is twofold the first is that whereby god doth forsake man only in regard of his assistance and strengthning by omitting the confirmation of the creature and by not conferring the second grace wherby the first might be made effectuall to resist temptations and to perseuere in goodnesse this is the desertion of triall and may happen to them who haue not theselues as yet forsaken god for it was in the first man adam who receiued of god power to do that which he would but not will to do that which be could so augustine he receiued saith he power if he willed but he had not will answerable to his power for if he had had he should haue perseuered againe he was able also to perseuere if he would and in that he would not it proceeded offree will which then was so free that he was able to will well and ill the cause of this desertion was that adam and his posterity might know that they could fall by themselues but that they could not stand much lesse rise againe and therefore that they should wholly depend on god mercy heere also it must be remembred that betweene this desertion and adams sin there came also adams will whereby he being left to his owne strength did by and by perceiue the very same his conscience telling and yet for all that he willed his owne fall by the free motion of his will the second desertion is a priuation and leesing of the gifts wherwith the mind is adorned and a deliuering into the power of sathan that he may seduce man and more and more lead them into sinne this is a desertion of punishment and therefore it followeth sinne and of this desertion and not of the former is the rule to be vnderstood a deo deserti deum priores deserunt those which are forsaken of god do themselues first forsake god and this is our doctrine of predestination which sauoreth neither of the errors of the manichees stoickes pelagians nor of epicurisme but is as i am perswaded agreeable to the truth and orthodoxall but yet it is oppugned by sundrie criminations or false accusations which i will striue with all my strength to ouerthrow and that briefely answere certaine man we say for all the elect are knowne vnto god and their number can neither be increased nor diminished few we do not say but after a prescript and certaine manner for to omit the angels if you consider the elect by themselues they are many matth i say vnto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit downe with abraham isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen revelation i beheld and loe a great multitude which no man could number of all nation kindreds people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lambe cl athed with long white robes and palmes in their hands yes there is as it were a world of elect augustine the church which is without spot and wrinkle and gaethered together out of all nation and which shall reigne with christ for euer euen she is the land of the blessed and the land of the liuing againe the reconciling world shal be deliuered out of the maligning world eusebius christ suffred for the saluation of the world of those which are to be saued the author of the booke de vocat gen lib in those which are elected foreknowne and seuered from the multitude of man there is a certaine speciall vniuersalitie counted that the whole world may seeme to be deliuered out of the whole world and that all man may seeme to be taken out of all man beda calleth those a world to be enlightned and healed who were predestinated to eternall life thomas the crue light enlighteneth those who come into the world of vertues not those which come into the world of vices neuerthelesse if those same elect be compared with them that are iustly damned wee say according to the scriptures that they are few matth the gate is narrow and the way streight which leadeth vnto life and few there be which find it againe many are called but few are chosen matth answere here the distinction of the double act in reprobation must bee repeated and retained first therefore i answere that reprobation in regard of the former act is absolute that is in regard of the purpose to forsake the creature and to manifest iustice in it so we teach and beleeue for we cannot so much as imagine a cause in the creature why it was god wil to passe by it and to suffer some to fall finally from their blessed estate yes sinne is it selfe after the desertion and iust permission of god and therefore it can by no meanes be the cause of the permission and desertion whence it is that lumbard the master of all the schoolemen saith that god hath reiected whom he would not for any future merits which he did foresee but yet most righteously though we cannot conceiue the reason thereof and ierome long before him dothd thus expound y place of paul rom ere the children were borne and whe they had neither done good nor euill if esau saith hee and iacob were not yet borne neither had done good or euill whereby they might win god fauour or offend him and if their election and reiection doth not shew their seuerall deserts but the will of the elector and reiector what shal we say afterwards if we grant this that god doth what soeuer hee will and that he either chuseth or condemneth a man without desert and workes it is not therefore in him that willeth nor in him that runneth but in god that sheweth mercie againe therefore it is in vaine asked seeing that it is in his power and will either to chuse or to refuse a man without good and euill workes anselmus it is not ours to know why god demeth grace to them which would gladly receiue and consent to grace and neglecteth another that would so well consent vnto it this is onely knowne to god againe no creature is able to search out why he is mercifull to this man rather than to another the same doe other schoolmen affirme in e midst of papacie gregorius ariminensis laieth downe sixe conclusios cocerning predestination first that there is no bodie predestinated for the well vsing of freewill which god for knew that he should haue secondly that no man is predestina ed because he was foreknowne to cotinue to the end without any let of habitual grace that whomsoeuer god predestinated m hee did predestinate freely purposedlie and of his pure mercie fourthly that no man is reiected for the euill vsing of freewill which god foresaw he would be tainted with fiftly that there is not any reiected because hee was foreknowne to haue finally an impedimet of diuine grace sixtlie that whomsoeuer god reiected him hee did reiect without anie cause in him the very same conclusions hath petrus de alliaco lib sent quaest article and marsilius of inghen lib dist q some of whose words i will set downe he is predestinated saith he to whom god hath purposed to giue euerlasting life and he is reiected on whom god hath determined not to bestow the same as the apostle teacheth rom againe no man that is predestinated is predestinated for any thing which should bee in him in time to come so also there is no reprobate reiected for any cause which was to be in him in time to come and euery one that is predestinate is predestinated only by grace amp by god mercifull disposition not for any cause either actuall or priuatiue to bee found in him whiles hee liueth againe to reiect is to nill to shewe mercie and this is not for the euill workes of any creature for how holy soeuer the workes were god would shew mercie as he listed so also francis mark lib x q article saith that there are foure signes necessarie for the vnderstading of the proceeding of predestination and reprobation first in which peter amp iudas are offred to the diuine will as to neither of the both and hen the diuine will preordaine p ter vnto gl ie but it had no posi ne act about iudas according to u ustine the second s gne is in which hee preordained peter to grace and the he had o posi ue act as yet about iudas the th d signe in which they are left to themselues and bot o them doe fall into sinne the fourth s gne is that in which peter riseth againe or he cannot continue because he is predestinated by the first signe but judas riseth not againe because he hath not god to raise him vp therefore hee is reiected d bannes in thom q the cause and reason of the whole worke of reprobation cannot be said to bee in the reprobates for sinne it selfe cannot be the cause of that pennission of sinne for which a man is damned whether it bee originall or actuall as it appeareth in infants who die only with originall sinne which verely howsoeuer it may be the cause why infants are forsaken in it yet neuerthelesse it cannot bee the cause and reason why the whole nature of man should be suffered to fall in adam and ferrariensis in thom cont gent pag saith that foure things are found in a reprobate to wi a sufferance to fall into sinne the sin it selfe god forsaking not raising him from sin and the punishment or damnation now reprobation is not alike but diuersly affected to all these for if we consider sinne in it self reprobation is not caused by i although nothing on our parts to wit no worke of ours bee the cause of the whole work of reprobatio for of al these together namely of the permission forsaking and punishment the manifestation of god iustice is the alone cause considering that no worke of ours is the cause of the permission yet notwithstanding our wicked working or sinne is the cause why wee are damned and punished againe we denie that god is cruell for we say that god doth not punish and torment the reprobate for the fulfilling as it were of his owne fancie but for sinne eternally foreknowne which he determined so to dispose of by punishing of it that his iustice might be made manifest thomas why hee ele teth these vnto glorie and reiecteth those he hath o reason but the diuine will againe the difference of those which are to be saued from them that are to be damned proceedeth from the principall ention of the first ag againe wee not enquire why he conuerieth these and not those for this commeth of his owne meere will and augustine vpo john why hee draweth this man and not that do not desire to iudge if thou wouldest not erre neuerthelesse reprobation in regarde of the second act that is in respect of the purpose to damne is not absolute but for sinne for no man perisheth but thorough his owne default and no man is absolutely ordained to hell or destruction but for his sinne hauing also receiued before in adam power whereby hee was able to liue holily and happely if so be that hee would and therefore i say that that which they alleage is a very calumnie secondly i answer that god did not simply create man to destroy him but that he might manifest his iudgement by the iust destruction of the sinner now it is one thing to will the destruction of a man as hee is man and another thing to will the deserued destruction of a man as he is a sinner heere also the iudgemet of cameracesis a iudicial scholeman is to bee heard and obserued according to the scripture saith hee although god should punish or afflict some creature eternally or vtterly abolish it without any sinne in it yet he should not deale vniustly or cruelly with it whence it is wisedome who dare accuse thee if the nation perish which thou hast madegod is not bound to lawes created as if any thing were iust before god did will i whereas indeed the contrarie is true answere we say that adams fall came to passe god not only foreknowing but also willing and decreeing it and that without blasphemie if thou wilt friendly and curteouslie giue leaue to shew how far forth and in what manner the will of god is twofold generall and speciall the special wil which the scripture calleth cephets is that by which god doth both approue and effect a thing or else it is god good pleasure whereby taking delight in some thing he doth will it simply both as touching the doing of it as also in respect of approbation the obiect of this will dependeth on the will and followeth it as the effect followeth the cause and by this will our iudgement is according to the word of god that god willeth that which is good and illeth that which is euill as it is euill psalm thou article a god which willest not iniquitie and of this kind or rather maner of will are these sentences of austi to be vnderstood god hath foreknowne but he did not f reappoint the workes of vngodlinesse and hee doth onely foreknow and not preordaine euils and it is all one to say god is the author and god willeth the generall will is that whereby god willeth a thing not to bee for that which is not therefore is not because hee willeth it shall not bee and for certaine causes also hee willeth not to hinder some things and consequently willeth that they shal come to passe which things notwithstanding hee doth not simplie approue or it is the decree of god whereby hee willeth some thing not in respect of approbation and effecting of it by himself but only in respect of suffering it to be done by others and here the thing which is to be done doth not depend vpo god will but onely vpon the will of the creature which falleth away and with this will we say that god willed the fall of adam yet not simplie but onely that it should come to passe now it is one thing to will a thing by it selfe and another thing to wil it as touching the euent moreouer hee willeth the euent of sinne not by effecting it himselfe but by forsaking or not hindring when he might if he would and if we enquire of the order of willing it is this first and properly god doth will not to inhibit and not to hinder sinne and by consequent onely hee willeth the euent of sinne for that which god doth nor hinder doth therfore come to passe because hee doth nor hinder it and as no good thing can either bee or come to passe vnlesse god make it so no euill thing can be auoyded except god doe hinder and there is not the least thing which may bee done without this will vnlesse we will say that god prouidence is idle which to say were wicked the reasons of this our iudgement are many the first reason i will draw out of most euident testimonies of scripture act him i say being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of god after you had taken with wicked hands you haue crucified and slain act they gathered themselues together to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and thy counsell had determined before to be done here it is to be obserued that not only christs passion but also the works which in respect of the iewes were wicked doe come vnder the decree and will of god to wit so far forth as god willed that they should come to passe for iust endes this very thing augustine signifieth when he saith when the father deliuered the son and christ his bodie and iudas his master in this deliuering wherefore is god iust and man guilty but because in one thing which they did there is not one cause for which they did it and there is no reason y r it should seeme harsh vnto any if speaking of adas fall we follow the holy scripture on this manner when adam did eate of the forbidden fruite he did eate that which the hand and counsell of god had determined before to bee done this is that very thing which we say this is the language of the apostles and of the church which therefore we may vse without the least suspition of blasphemie but to the former testimonies i will adde one place out of peter epistle it is better if the will of god be so that yee suffer for well doing than for euill doing but to punish man so well doing in respect of man it is f a ly to transgresse the law of god furthermore god is said to bid shimet to curse dauid that is to haue ordained and decreed for god biddeth and commandeth a thing two waies first by his reuealed will and this he doth by his word de iuered vnto man secondly by his secret will which is his prouidence or hidden decree by which hee doth so gouerne all things that nothing can be done without it or against it as in these places ser i will commaund and call backe the assyrians against this citie lam who is he then that saith and it commeth to passe and the lord commandeth it not iob he saith to the snow be thou vpon the earth likewise to the small raine and to the great raine of his power by which it appeareth that it may well be said that god decreed that shimei should curse dauid and it is the like kind of speech to say that god did not decree adams fall simply but in some respect the second reason followeth it is the common opinion of all man that god doth will to suffer sinne but to will to suffer it is to will not to hinder it and to will not to conferre grace now he which foreknoweth some future euill and willeth not to hinder it when hee might and not to conferre confirming grace he doth indeed will that the same should come to passe therefore we doe not place that will whereby wee say that god doth will that sinne should come to passe and bee in nature either without or beyond the diuine permission but we doe enwrap and enfold it in it and this is that which caluin saith and no other it often offendeth some es eares to heare that god willed the fall of man but i pray you what other thing is his permission besides wil who hath authoritie to hinder and in whose power the matter standeth the same affirmeth beza if any man heare that some things come to passe which indeed are done against his will that is against his liking not because he cannot but because he will not hinder the i answer that it is all one as if a ma should say that they come to passe hee being willing they should for those things which he could surely hinder if he would must needs come to passe because by not hindring of them he willeth that they should come to passe and whatsoeuer god doth not hinder he doth therefore not hinder it either because he willeth that it should be done or because he doth vtterly nill that it shuld be done or because he doth not will it should bee done or else because hee cares not that is hee neither willeth nor nilleth that it should come to passe if you graunt the first i haue my desire the second is absurd namely that god doth not hinder euill because hee doth vtterlie nill that it should bee done for this is to make god incostant the third lumbard and the schoolemen affi me for they say that god in respect of sinne hath no positiue act neither of willing nor of nilling but onely a negatiue act of not willing to hinder it but by this meanes a great part of those things which are done in the world should come to passe god being either ignorant or negligent the very permission also is a certaine will and not a pure negation for no to will to hinder that is to suffer is indeed to will not to hinder if thou wilt say the fourth thou doest wickedly make an idle and epicurish god therefore wee must needs retire vnto the first viz that god doth decree that euill should come to passe in such sort as i haue declared yet the fault must not bee for all that translated vnto him because he doth iustly and holily decree that which man doe wickedly thirdlie we know that adams reuolting is now past and done therefore wee must say that god did will that it should be done vnlesse we shall say that his prouidence is not in all and euerie thing thou wilt say that an euill worke is ordeined of god that is disposed to god glorie the saluation of the godly and the destruction of the wicked i grant it but not this onely for the prouidence of god is ouer the world and euery thing therein both in respect of the ende as also of the beginning of euerie action sathan and the wicked doe not onely not finish that which they would but they doe not so much as begin it vnlesse god willeth and giueth leaue it seemeth impious to thinke that any thing though as little as may be doth either exist or come to passe besides that which god being alwaies holy and inst hath willingly from all eternitie decreed fourthly let vs heare the iudgement of the ancient church augustine we must know that all things are either perfi d the lord helping or permitted the lord forsaking that thou maist know that nothing is at all admitted the lord being vnwilling againe there is nothing done but that which the almightie willeth to bee done either by suffering it to bee done or by doing it himselfe againe sometimes a man willeth a thing with a holy will which god willeth not againe it is possible that a man should will this with an euill will which god willeth with a good will so much difference is there twixt what is fitting for man to will and what is fitting for god to will and to what end euery one referreth his will so as that it may bee allowed or disapprooued and againe know that whatsoeuer falleth out here contrarie to our will happeneth not but by the will of god his prouidence ordinance appointment and decrees tertullian god hath foreknowne all things by disposing them and disposed them by foreknowing them ierome shall i say that any thing is done without thee and that the wicked can doe so much against thy will surely it were blasphemie so to imagine and againe what good or euill things soeuer are in the world they happen not by casuall chance and without the prouidence of god but by his pleasure hugo saith man may well endure the hearing of this and it may be said without any scruple or trouble of conscience god willeth that which is good but if it bee said god willeth that which is euill it is a thing very grieuous to bee heard and a religious minde doth not easily conceits of that which is goodnesse it selfe that it willeth evil for then it seemeth to be said that the good loueth that which is euill and approueth that which is bad and therefore a godly minde reiecteth this not because that which is said is not well said but because that which is well said is not well vnderstood but after what sort it ought to bee vnderstood hee himselfe in the selfe same place explaneth this saith he is onely said and yet another thing is meant and vnderstood because god willeth that euill be and yet willeth not the euill and againe he will that euill be and yet he wil that therein be nothing but that which is good and againe when hee doth good and suffereth euill his will appeareth in this because he wils that to be which he doth or permitteth and againe the will of god is his good pleasure and his will is his working and his will is his permission catharinus saith we need not be afraid to confesse that god willeth sinne as blessed augustine saith also not because he willeth sinne as it is sinne and euill but as it is good to wit as it is is the punishment of sinne and vengeance in the reprobate for that is god purpose and it is good and not euill or as sinne it selfe is an occasion vnto good in his beloued and elect but they vse to obiect thus to will that euill be done is proper and belonging to an euill will which is delighted with euils or would vse them to good contrary to the rule that no euill should be done that good might come thereof to this i answere that heere are two grounds to bee laid the first is that the obiect euen of mans will is good and therefore much more of god will and the obiect of the will cannot be euill by it selfe but by accident for if the will willeth euill it willeth it not as it is euill but as it is good the second ground is that there is a certaine summum bonum or soueraigne good with which there is no euill conioynd because there is a certaine thing infinitely good namely god but there is not any absolute euill because there is nothing so euill but it hath some good ioyned therewith and therefore it is good that sinne should be and come to passe so saith s augustine although therfore those things which are euill so farre forth as they are euill are not good neuerthelesse it is good that there should bee not onely good things but also euill for vnlesse this were good that there should be also euils they should o meanes bee suffered by the almigh o is goodnesse it selfe thus therefore i answere that sinne in the causes and circumstances thereof fully and exactly weighed is two waies to be considered first we consider sinne not as it is sinne but so farre foorth as it hath some respect vnto good with god which decreeth it and this way taking sinne although god willeth it not simply and by it selfe yet he decreeth it and willeth it as touching the euent moreouer sinne hath respect vnto god two manner of waies first because it is in that which is good secondly because it tendeth to that which is good i say it is in that which is good because euery euill is in that which is good as in the subiect now in respect of the subiect that is as sinne is a motion an inclination or an action god both willeth and effecteth the same moreouer sin tendeth to that which is good because god ordaineth it to good and from thence draweth the good either of triall chastisement or punishment and we say that god is so farre foorth willing that sinne should come to passe as hee is able and will by his wonderfull wisedome from thence to draw foorth that which is good secondly we consider sinne according to the propertie and naturall being thereof that is sinne as it is sinne and this way also we weigh sinne either so far forth as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of man or as it is sinne to god but god himselfe neither willeth nor approueth nor effecteth sinne as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of the creatures that offend and yet hee willeth as touching the euent not simplie as those things that are good in themselues but only by willing to permit that it may be for there is a threefold action of god wil the first is that whereby god willeth any thing by willing it that is when he willeth it with his whole and absolute will as tertullian saith and this way he willeth that which is good in it selfe the second action is that whereby he nilleth any thing by nilling it as that which shall neuer come to passe because god doth vtterly nill the being thereof the third and last action is remisse and in the middest betweene both whereby hee willeth some thing by nilling it slackely or remissely that is when hee partly willeth it and partly nilleth it or else so far forth wills it as that for iust causes he nills it and after this sorte wee say that god willeth the euent of euill as it is euill in it selfe in respect of man because euill as it is euill after this sorte is not absolutely euill and god draweth good out of euill as it is euill in the nature thereof or in it selfe as hee brought forth light out of darkenesse euen as it was darkenesse in it selfe and if so be that euill were absolurely euill as god is absolutely good he would in no wise will the euent of euill neither should there be any euill existent at all for that which god vtterly nilleth hath not any being or existence but sin as it is sin to god now that is a sinne to god which is in it selfe sinne in his decree whereby all things are ordained as it considereth sinne hee neither willeth it nor approueth it nor worketh it no in this respect he doth not so much as permit it i doe not denie but that god permitteth and suffreth euill as it is euill in it selfe otherwise there were not euill properly and naturally but i denie that he permitteth it because it is euill for god neuer suffreth euill for it selfe but for the good that is therewith conioyned and this is the meaning of that saying of beza the lord neuer permitteth sins as they are sins yes rather be euermore forbiddeth and hindreth them and againe sinnes so farre forth as they are permitted by god being thereto willing are not sinnes but the punishments of sinne and thus vsing this exposition is the mind and iudgement of master caluin of blessed memorie to bee vnderstood where as he saith that all the son of adam did fall away by god will and againe that it was decreed by god that adam should perish by his owne falling away and againe it was the secret counsell of god in which the fall of man was ordained and againe adam did not fall away but according to god knowledge and ordinance in these and such like maner of speeches his purpose was to ouerthrow the opinion of the schoolemen who would haue his permission seuered from his will it were good therefore for them better to consider of the matter who without either chatitie or humanitie doe with the blasphemies of the manichees slaunder and bely this holy man secondly they vse to obiect that god willeth things contrarie if hee will that that should come to passe which hee forbiddeth in his law answer it is true indeed if he should will one and the same thing to come to passe and not to come to passe in one and the same respect and manner but god forbiddeth euill as it is euill and willeth it to come to passe as it hath respect vnto good heereupon aquinas saith that euill be and that euill bee not are contradictorilie opposed but that god willeth euill to be and that god willeth euill not to be are not contradictorily opposed seeing both are affirmatiue thirdly they obiect thus that thing which being graunted another thing necessarilie followeth is the cause of that selfe same thing that doth follow but this being granted that god willed the fall of adam to come to passe the same came to passe necessarily and infallibly therfore the will of god was in this respect the cause of sinne whereto i answere that the first proposition of this argument is not generall for in admitting the creation of the world both the place and the time or continuance thereof are infallibly and without doubt also to bee admitted and yet the creation of the world is not the cause of the continuance thereof and of the place where it now consisteth and that this proposition may be true it is thus to be framed that thing which being granted another thing infallibly followeth no other cause comming betweene is the cause of the very same thing that followeth and the second proposition also sitted to this former is vntrue for this being granted that god willeth sin to happen sin shall not come to passe immediatly but by the meanes of mans free wil amp although it come to passe infallibly on god part which decreeth it yet it comes to passe freely on mans part for it had been possible for man not to haue sinned when hee did sinne if hee had would as may appeare by this similitude god forsaketh man by not conserring and bestowing on him necessarie and sufficient helpe for the auoyding of sinnes now man being forsaken by him sinneth necessarily and yet the fault is not to be laid on god because that in this his forsaking him the will of man commeth betweene for god forsaketh man being willing to bee forsaken and not against his will and mind secondly i answere to the aforesaid reproch of our doctrine that wee say not that sinne is from the decree or of the decree of god as from the efficient materiall formall or finall cause but wee doe teach and au rre that sinne commeth to passe according to the prouidence or decree of god as the sole consequent thereof for wee assuredly thinke and iudge that the decree of god doth so go before the sinne of man as that it hath no respect vnto any cause vnlesse it be of such a one as is a failing and deficient cause so saith augustine therefore truely the great works of the lord are exquisite in all his wills so that after a wonderfull and vnspeakable manner that is not done beside his will which notwithstanding is done contrary to his will againe it is obiected he that saith that the decree of god is the energeticall operatiue beginning of all things necessarilie maketh the decree of god the beginning also of sinne whereunto i answer that the holy ghost himselfe saith that the decree of god is the beginning of all things being and existent ephesians i cap ii verse god worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will and againe in the of the acts in him we liue we moue and haue our being augustine saith the will of god is the very cause of all things which are hugo de s vict saith there is no cause of the will of god which is the cause of all things and this very thing common reason will teach vs because there must first some certaine ground be laid from whence euery thing should haue or take the being and existence thereof and this ground is euen the very will of god for a thing is not first and then afterward god willeth it to come to passe but because god hath decreed that a thing should come to passe or be done therefore it is and yet shall not god therefore bee the cause of sinne because sinne is not properly a thing action or being but a defect only and yet neuerthelesse it is not therefore nothing for whatsoeuer hath a being is either really and positiuely or else in reason onely and vnder those things which are in reason are contained not only notions and relations but also priuations because they haue not a reall matter and forme out of the vnderstanding but sinne hath not a positiue and reall being amp yet it hath a being in reason as they terre it for so farre forth it is in the nature of things being as it may cause a true composition in the mind and although it doe not exist positiuely that is by matter or forme created yet it is priuatiuely because that by the remoue or taking away of originall righteousnesse that doth immediatly and truly follow and exist neither doth it follow as some other naturall habit or as a pure negation but as a certaine thing betweene both that is a want and absence of the contrarie good some vse to obiect that wee doe teach that god doth incline vnto sinne and that hee doth positiuely harden the heart whereto i answere that wee allow not a bare permission seuered vtterly from his will neither doe we atribute a positiue or naturall action vnto god as though hee did infuse corruption and sinne and yet we say that hee doth actiuely harden the heart the action of god prouidence as saith suidas in the works of man is threefold the first is according to his good pleasure whereby god willeth any work alloweth it effecteth it and is therewith delighted this action is onely in good workes which haue their beginning in vs from the holy ghost the second action of god prouidece is of sustaining wherby god vpholdeth and maintaineth the being and all the faculties motions actions and passions of nature which offendeth act in him we liue and moue and haue our being and although god do sustaine nature offending and the action of nature yet is hee free from fault because he vpholdeth the creature onely as it is a creature not as it is euill for the second cause as the will of man can by it selfe doe euilly and corruptly yet it can doe nothing by it selfe vnlesse the effect thereof bee reduced to the first cause as may appeare more plainly by this similitude a man doth hault by reason that his legge is out of ioynt now heere are two things to be considered the very walking or motion it selfe and his haulting the haulting proceedes onely from his legge out of ioynt the walking both from his legge and also from the facultie of mouing in like manner a man sinning in that he doth it is of god but in that he doth euilly it is of himself we must therfore heere know that god doth vphold order as it is of nature but furthereth not the will violently breaking out against the order of the morall law the third action of god prouidence is according vnto concession whereby god in the evil worke of man worketh some things holily and this last action is threefold the first is permission whereby god forsaketh especially the wicked by withdrawing from them his grace and by leauing them according to their deserts vnto their owne wickednesse which hee had before restrained that it might not breake forth to so immoderate libertie and wee vse commonly to say that he which permitteth doth and effecteth some thing as when the rider giueth the reines vnto his wanton and sporting horse wee say that hee doth moue and encourage him and wee say that the hunter doth put his dog on the game when as hee letteth him slip the second action as i may so terme it is occasionall whereby god by proffered occasions in themselues good or indifferent outwardly draweth foorth stirreth vp and bringeth out sinne in those who of themselues openly runne into wickednesse to the intent that hee may either iustly punish their knowne impietie or else discouer it being closely shrouded the like haue wee ordinarily euen among our selues for the physitian by his preseruatiue medicine stirreth vp inflameth and draweth foorth the humour out of the corruption of the bodie admit a house be weakely timbred which being almost now already falne wilere log fall and that i doe not with any engines or instruments throw or beate down the same but onely take away the outward hindrances and on euery side as it were open a way for the downfall to the intent that when it falleth it may by the greater fall be broken in peeces after this sort dealeth god with the wicked and hereupon is it that the law is said to stirre vp and increase sinne in paul rom this action is done many manner of waies as when the hindrances of sinne are taken away when as the way is opened to the committing of one especiall sinne and not of another when as obiects are offered which the vngodly vse as instigations vnto sinne these obiects are commandements threatnings exhortations and cogitations either good or indifferent put by god in the mindes of vngodly man from the which the wicked by reason of his wickednesse doth greedily take an occasion to doe ill and this is the manner and way truly whereby wee say that god stirreth man vnto euill without infusing the least drop or iot of euill for as in the middle region of the aire the heate groweth stronger by the antiperistasis or repulsion on euery part from whence proceeds the thunder and lightning and by the heate round incompassed the clowdes are condensated and made thicke euen so the wicked and vngodly when they are stirred vp by wholsome precepts doe grow more vngodly and euill doth so much the more begin to delight them by how much the more they know that it is lesse lawful for them according to the saying of the poet nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negara we still endeuour things forbid and couet thats denide the third action is a disposing whereby god through the euill worke of an euill instrument finisheth his owne worke iustly and holily as for example the sale of ioseph in his brother was sin the iust action of god in this euill worke was the foresending of ioseph into egypt for the common good and benefit of iacobs familie and from this disposing proceedes it that god vseth the sins of man olily that hee prouoketh them holily and ordreth them as the physition for a medicine ordreth poyson contrary to the nature thereof that he ordreth them holily both according to the causes and beginnings and also according to the ends and issue as when he disposeth the work of the diuell infusing corruption either to the punishment of correction vengeance or triall but concerning these let vs rather giue care to ancient writers clemens alexandrinus saith it belongeth to god wisedome vertue and power not onely to doe good which is the nature of god but also especially to bring vnto some good and profitable end that which hath been inuented by those which are euill and vse profitably those things which doe seeme euill augustine saith god maketh and ordaineth iust man but hee maketh not sinners as they are sinners but ordreth them onely and againe as god is the most excellent creator of good natures so is he the most iust disposer of euill wils againe god verily fulfilleth certaine of his good wils by the euill wils of euill man againe god by those man which doe those things which hee will not doth himselfe those things which he will and againe god vsing well euen those that are euill as being himselfe absolutely good so farre foorth as in them lay they did that which god would not in this very thing that they did that which was contrarie to god will euen by them his will is done and againe who would not tremble at these iudgements of god whereby god doth in the hearts of euill man what soeuer hee will giuing vnto them according to their deserts and againe it is plaine that god worketh in the hearts of man to encline their wils whither soeuer he will either vnto those things that are good for mercie or else vnto those things that are euill for their deserts somtimes verily in his open iudgement sometimes in his secret iudgement but euermore in his iust iudgement and againe god maketh not euill wils but vseth them as he list because hee cannot will any thing that is vniust fulgentius saith although god be not the author of euill thoughts yet he is the disposer of euill wils and out of the euill worke of euery one he doth not cease to worke that which is good in respect of these diverse actions concerning sinne it commeth to passe that we finde it said in the scripture that god doth harden doth make blinde doth deceiue doth command a worke that is euill yes and doth the same and that hee deliuereth ouer to beastly affections ampc thirdly i answere to the aforesaid reproch of this our doctrine that wee doe vtterly abhorre and detest the stoicall fate because it appointeth an inherent necessitie in things themselues which should bind euen god himselfe and all other things and make them subiect thervnto for howsoeuer wee doe beleeue that the very decree of god is immutable and therefore necessarie yet in god himselfe it was most free for hee could either not haue decreed that which hee did decree or else otherwise haue decreed it i and he addeth to the second causes placed out of god a certaine necessitie but yet so free a one as that it is rather to be termed a libertie then a necessitie and this shall easily appeare to be as i say if i shall first shew what sortes of necessitie there bee and how farre forth it is agreeable vnto thinges first therefore a thing is necessary two waies absolutely amp conditionally that is obsolutely necessarie which cannot be otherwise or else whose contrarie is impossible as that god is omnipotent and iust and that is conditionally necessarie which cannot be otherwise but yet not simply but by the granting of one or many things and this kind of necessitie is either by nature or the commaundement or decree of god that is necessarie by nature which commeth to passe constantly and immutably by reason of that order which god hath set in the nature of things after this sort is it of necessitie that fire doe burne that the earth is carried downeward and the heauen moued that is necessarie by commaundement which is necessarily to be done because god hath commanded it after this fort it is of necessitie that one vndergoe the office of a magistrate rom that is necessarie by the decree of god which is so because god hath foreknowne it and willed either to effect it or at the least to permit it after this sort euery thing in respect of god is necessarie and the will of god as augustine saith is the necessitie of things secondly necessitie is either of compulsion or infallibility necessitie of compulsion is that which inferreth violence to things by some cause working without and forciblie constraineth that they doe either this or that and this indeed is the stoicall necessitie that a man should doe any thing against his will being compelled by force and necessitie there is also such a like kind of necessitie of the manichees condemned by the fathers who taught that there was no violence or necessitie offred vnto the will by god nor that it was forced by necessitie to sinne the necessitie of infallibilitie is that whereby a thing according to the euent shall certainly and immutably come to passe yet so as if we consider the cause of a thing by it selfe it may either not come to passe or else come otherwise to passe of this manner of necessitie wee must vnderstand that principle euerie thing that is when it is is of necessity and thus is necessitie distinguished now will i shew how farre forth it is agreeable to seuerall things the euents of all things haue reference either to the second causes or to god who is the first cause now some things in respect of the second causes are necessary othersome contingent from causes which are necessarie must needs proceede that which is necessarie from those that are free that which is free from those that are naturall that which is naturall and to bee briefe such as are the next causes aforegoing such also is the euent of things but in respect of god all things whatsoeuer are partly changeable and partly necessarie in respect of god libertie which doth that which it doth freely all things are contingent and mutable howsoeuer according to nature and the order of the next causes they be necessarie and immutable in respect of god decree the second causes and the effects of them are all necessarie howsoeuer in themselues they bee vncertaine and conti nt and yet they are not absolutelie necessarie but by the supposition of god decree neither are they necessarie by the necessitie of compulsion but of infallibilitie only because god ordained before that those things which should come to passe should be and this kind of necessitie taketh not away the contingencie and libertie of second causes but rather establisheth and confirmeth it for that which is free worketh freely and that which is contingent worketh contingently by the necessarie decree of god neither doth libertie and necessitie mutually ouerthrow each other but libertie and compulsion it is manifest therefore that god decree causeth an immutabilitie to all things of which notwithstanding some in respect of the next causes are necessarie and othersome contingent but all of them in respect of god liberty mutable and as the mutabilitie which thinges haue from god power taketh not away the necessitie which they haue from the second causes so the necessitie of immutabilitie by god decree consequently comming to passe taketh not away the contingencie which they haue from the next causes and god libertie moreouer wee say that god decree ordaineth the second causes and the verie libertie it selfe also of mans will not by compulsion as if a man should violently throw a stone but by inclining and gentlie bending them by obiects outwardlie offred to the vnderstanding euen as a sheepe is said to be drawne when grasse is shewed her being an hungry that a man may choose by his owne free motion or refuse that which god hath iustly decreed from all eternitie these things being granted it is manifest also what we ought to thinke concerning the fall of adam which truely according to the euent is necessarie by the necessitie of infallibilitie by reason of the forcknowledge and decree of god yet so as that god is not guiltie of any fault because the decree of god howsoeuer it was necessarie in it selfe yet it planted nothing in adam whereby he should fall into sinne but left him to his owne libertie not hindring his fall when it might and the same fall in respect of mans wil which doth that freely that it doth came to passe contingently and most freely but you will say that adam could not withstand god will that is his decree whereto i answere that euen as he could not so also hee would not but you will say againe he could not will otherwise which i confesse to bee true as touching the act and euent but not as touching the very power of his will which was not compelled but of the owne free motion consented vnto the suggestio of the diuell but to the intent that these things may more plainely bee vnderstood wee must make distinction betweene three times the time going before his fall the present time of his fall and the time after his fall in the first moment of time the fal of adam was necessarie in a double respect first by reason of the foreknowledge of god for that which he foreknew would come to passe must needes of necessitie come to passe secondly by reason of the permissiue decree of god that fal was according to the euent necessarie immutably honorius augustodunensis saith it cannot otherwise e but that al things must come to passe which god hath predestinated amp foreknowne seeing that hee onely either doth all things or permitteth them to be done hugo de s victore saith sinne followeth of necessitie by the withdrawing of grace and the reason hereof is very easie because euill permitted must come to passe and cannot otherwise come to passe than god permitteth for to permit euill is not to stirre vp the will and not to bestow on him that is tempted the act of resisting but to leaue him as it were to himselfe and he whose will is not stirred vp by god and to who the act of resisting is not conferred howsoeuer he may haue power to withstand yet can he not actually will to withstand nor persist for euer in that vprightnesse wherein hee was created god denying him strength i confesse truly that this kinde of necessitie as touching the liberty of mans will was altogether euitable and to be auoided and yet according to the euent of the action it was ineuitable yet i would not that any man should thinke that this necessitie did any way proceede from the decree of god which did onely follow the decree being granted and admitted and adam in his temptation being destitute of the helpe of god cast himselfe of his own accord into this same ensuing necessitie of sinning in the second time his fall being present there was another necessitie thereof because when it was it was of necessitie in the third time man drew vnto himselfe by his fault his nature being now corrupted another necessitie of sinning insomuch that he made himselfe the servant of sin bernard saith i know not after what euill and strange manner the will it selfe corrupted or changed to worse maketh a necessitie to sinne and yet the necessitie although it be voluntarie is not able to excuse the will nor the will although it bee enticed to exclude necessitie if any man shall say that by this our platforme many are tied by an ineuitable necessitie to bee damned i would haue him giue care to augustine who saith hold this most stedfastly and doubt not in any wise that any can perish whom god before the creation of the world hath of his free goodnesse made vessels of mercieor that any of them whom he hath not predestinated to eternall life can by any meanes be saued and yet i say that the decree of reprobation doth not cause a necessitie of damnation in any man for the first act thereof which is a purpose not to shew mercie causeth not this necessitie in man but goeth before it as an antecedent and man himselfe verily hath brought vpon himselfe this necessitie with his owne most free yet rebelling will now the second act of reprobation which is a purpose of condemning causeth not any necessitie of damnation but by the sinne of man comming betweene moreouer the necessitie of damnation followeth after the same manner by the foreknowledge of god and yet this neuer seemed a thing strange vnto any one but some will say that the foreknowledge of god doth neuer cause in man any necessitie of damnation although it doe assuredly foresee the same and i say also that reprobation doth either not at all cause damnation in man or that it doth not cause it but for sinne but it may be obiected they that are predestinated vnto damnation cannot be freed by repentance although they would whereto i answere with augustine as they did fall by their will so by their will they are content to lie and he that turneth himselfe away from god hath both depriued himselfe of will to doe that which is good and also of power it doth not therefore follow as they imagine which obiect such things that god hath taken repentance from those to whom he gaue it not and hath throwne downe those whom he hath not taken vp moreouer the selfe same necessitie followeth of their hypothesis who affirme a bare permission for that which god permitteth the selfe same thing will hee not hinder and euill if god hinder not cannot bee auoyded and that which cannot be auoyded shall come to passe infallibly and therfore euill permission being once graunted of necessitie cometh to passe although most freely on mans part whereupon it is plaine that the decree of god is not more ineuitable than is the very permission separated from the decree i doe wish that they would well weigh and cosider this who obiect vnto vs either the stoicall fate or the do ages of the manichees for we differ from them as much in certaine iudgement amp opinion as whosoeuer doe differ most for first the stoickes doe tie god vnto the second causes so that he cannot doe otherwise then the nature of them will suffer wee on the other side doe hold that all second causes do depend vpon and are ordered by god secondly the stoickes say that neither god nor second causes can doe otherwise by their nature than they doe wee say that some second causes are by god ordinance mutable othersome immutable and that god himselfe can either not doe that which hee doth or else doe it otherwise but now to come to the manichees who make two coeternall god we but one they of their two god make one good and another euill we say that there is one absolutely good amp iust god thirdly they wil haue one of their god to bee the cause and worker of good things and the other of evil we make one true god the creatour and ruler of all things and working nothing but that which is most good and most iust fourthly they say that they which are created by their good god cannot sinne we say that god doth most freely conuert whom hee will and when they are conuerted they can neuer in this life perfectly be free fro sinnes but doe sometimes run into such sinnes as doe grieuously wound the conscience fiftly they say that they that are created by the evil god simply cannot be conuerted wee say that vncleane spirites and man were created both good and holy but yet they fell by their owne will and fault and not by any fault but the iust permission of the creatour and brought vpon themselues a necessitie of sinning and although it be true that man cannot withhold himselfe from sinning vnlesse god giue him that grace yet doth he not sin of necessitie that is of compulsio but willingly and the will hath sufficient libertie if by it selfe or the nature therof it be inclinable to the cotrary of that which it chooseth and doth of the owne accord choose that which it chooseth although the same liberty bee gouerned and one way limited by god wherefore i am flat of anselmus opinion who saith although it bee of necessity that those things do come to passe which are foreknowne and predestinated yet some things foreknowne and predestinated doe not come to passe by that necessitie which goeth before a thing and causeth is but by the same necessitie which followeth a thing for god doth not cause although he doth praedestinate them by forcing the will as by resisting it but by leauing them in the power thereof and i am also of gaudentius his opinion who saith the iewes were willing to doe that euill which they did and verily if they had bin vnwilling to doe it they had not done it and it is a grosse sinne but to thinke that god who is not onely good and righteous but also goodnesse and righteousnesse it selfe doth either command or compel any thing to be done which he condemneth when it is done but that i may in a word fully deliuer my opinion if it bee demanded how the will of god carrieth it selfe to good or euill i answere that in a good act god carrieth himselfe positiuely for first he determineth the euent of good by willing effectually to worke it and secondly hee inwardly inclineth the will of the creature to doe that good which it doth thirdly he sometimes laieth a necessitie of immutabilitie on him that doth well but yet it is ioyned with an exceeding freedome after this sort the elect angels doe necessarily obey god yet not by constraint but greatly coueting and with all the strength of their will desiring it not being thereunto compelled in an euill act i say that god carrieth himselfe priuatiuely not by a logical but a natural priuation foregoing the habit for first he willeth that euill come to passe not by doing it himselfe but by willing not to hinder it to be done by others secondly he doth not inwardly incline the will to doe euill but he forsaketh and outwardly offereth obiects which are good in themselues thirdly god laieth not on vs any necessitie but a desertio or want of grace to which being imposed followeth the necessitie of sinning not as the effect doth his cause but as the defect doth him that forsaketh and this i am resolued on that god decree doth altogether order euery euent partly by inclining and gently bending the will in all things y t are good and partly by forsaking it in things that are euill and yet the will of the creature left vnto it selfe is carried headlong of the owne accord not of necessitie in it selfe but contingently that way which the decree of god determined from eternitie we therefore thankes be giuen vnto god doe with all our hearts renounce the doting follies of the stoickes and the manichees answere it might happily seeme a rigorous course that some should bee depriued of christ if so bee that they had neuer at any time nor any where receiued sauing grace but all and euery one receiued holinesse and happinesse in adam together with abilitie to perseuere and remaine in the some holy and happie estate if they had would but adam would not but did of his owne accord cast away that grace which was bestowed on him by his creator for which being lost it is a wonder that all without exception are not damned and therefore it may seeme the lesse strange to any one if grace by christ bee againe bestowed vpon one and not vpon another secondly i answere that wee doe acknowledge with glad mindes that christ died for all the scripture auerring so much but we vtterly deny that he died for all and euer one alike in respect of god or as well for the damned as elect and that effectually on god part for first let vs weigh well the words of christ i neuer knew you depart from me yee workers of iniquitie now to know with god is to acknowledge and therefore whom christ neuer knew hee neuer acknowledged for his and those whom he hath not sometime acknowledged he neuer bought or redeemed with the price of his bloud and therefore well saith gregorie not to know with god is to reiect againe if al and euery one be effectually redeemed al and euery one are reconciled vnto god because that the forgiuenesse of sinnes and the satisfaction for the same are inseparably ioyned together yes and paul placeth redemption in the remission of sins where he saith by whom we haue redemption through his bloud euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes very well therefore saith prosper as it is not sufficient for the renewing of man that christ iesus was borne man vnlesse they bee renued also in the same spirit whereof he was borne so it is not sufficient for mans redemption that christ iesus was crucified vnlesse wee die together and be buried with him in baptisme of these premises therfore i frame this assumptio but al are not reconciled vnto god neither doe all receiue remission of sinnes for then all man were blessed and it were not possible for them to perish which thing to affirme of all and euery one is very grosse thirdly christ gaue himselfe that hee might sanctifie vnto himselfe a people peculiar that is as a precious treasure and his owne gotten good selected and chosen from among other therefore it was not christs purpose to giue himselfe for a ansome for all amp euery one alike fourthlie for whom redemption it ordained to them al is giuen on god part the making of them sonnes by christ but the making of sonnes or adoption is not graunted to all and euery one euen on god part for the power of the adoption wherby a man is made of the child of wrath the child of god is only giuen to those y beleeue and apprehend christ they are saith augustine the children of god who are not as yet so vnto vs and yet they are so vnto god because that by beleeuing they should afterwardes bee so through the preaching of the gospell and yet before this was so they were engrauen the children of god by a stedfast and immutable stabilitie in the register of their father and againe there are some which in respect euen of some present or temporall grace which they haue receiued are said by vs i bee the children of god and yet are they not so vnto god fiftly none are truely redeemed on god part but they who are freed from sinne both according to the power that it hath to cause damnation and also according to the power that it hath to reigne in them in this do the antient fathers agree for augustine saith by this mediatour god sheweth that he doth make them of euill man eternally good whom he hath redeemed with his blood and againe those whom he would make his brother he freed and made them fellow heires and againe christ will haue no partaker in that which hee hath bought but will possesse it wholly to himselfe and to that end gaue hee so great a price that hee might onely possesse the same isychius saith christ who suffered for vs hath freed vs from sinne and the bondage thereof remigius saith thou article the reconciler thou article the reconcilement and blessed shall they bee for whom thou shalt make reconciliation out of these i thus conclude all and euery one are not redeemed according to both the aforesaid powers of sinne for let vs grant that on god part they are freed fro damnation yet they are not in such measure indued with grace as that sinne shall no more reigne in them christ therefore is but onely the halfe redeemer of these and for that cause not a redeemer lastly let vs diligently consider the iudgemet of ancient writers ambrose saith if thou beleeuest not christ came not downe for thee neither did he suffer for thee augustine saith euery one that is generated is damned and no one is freed vnlesse he be regenerated and againe it is well said i will haue mercie on whom i will haue mercie for if the whole world being in thraldome and in the power of sinne and most iustly ordained to punishment bee neuerthelesse in part by god mercie freed who can say vnto god why dost thou condemne the world and againe he that hath bought vs at so deere a price will not that we whom he hath bought should bee destroyed god hath giuen a great price and bought those who he quickneth and again of whose mercie is it but of his who hath sent iesus christ into this world to saue sinners whom he hath both foreknowne and predestinated and called and iustified and glorified bernard saith christ needed none of these neither did hee any of these things in regard of himselfe but rather in regard of the electthey were not directly the iewes to whom he was sent but the elect for whom hee was sent haimo saith euen as by one man death amp sin came generally to our condemnation so by the one iustice of man which is of christ to all man elected and predestinated to eternall life came grace to the iustification of life and againe he tooke not away in the elect onely originall but also actuall sinnes and therefore grace and the gift through grace did downe vnto the elect aquin as faith christ merit according to the sufficiencie carrieth it selfe indifferently to all but not according to the efficacy which happenethpartly by god election through which the effect of christs me its is mercifully bestowed on some and partly by the iust iudgement of god withdrawne from other some obiect i against this it is thus obiected the scripture affirmeth that christ redeemed the world whereto i answer that this word world in the writings of the apostles doth not signifie both all and euery man that descended from adam but all nation in this last age of the world god saith paul was recociling the world vnto him in christ what meaneth this word world in this place surely not all man of al ages but the gentiles which were to bee called after the ascension of christ as paul plainly explaining his own minde sheweth rom wherefore if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more shall their abundance be and againe in the verse if the casting away of them that is of the iewes be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiuing be but life from the dead in these very words he plainly sheweth that the reconciliation of the world is the reconciliation of the gentiles after the casting away of the iewes and hereby it is most manifest that all the like places of scripture which many doe think to make for the vniuersall redemption of all and euery one are to be vnderstood of some man to be called but of euery nation and country after the death of christ and hereunto also let vs ioyne the answere of augustine he calleth oftentimes euen the church it selfe by the name of the world according vnto that god was reconciling the world vnto himselfe in christ and againe the son of man came not to iudge the world but that the world might be saued through him and john saith in his epistle wee haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ the iust and hee is the reconciler of our sinnes and not onely of ours but also of the whole world therefore the whole world is the church and the whole world hateth the church therefore the world hateth the world the malignant world the reconciled world the damned the saued and the defited that which is cleansed but this world which god in christ reconcileth vnto himselfe and which by christ is saued and to which all sin is through christ pardoned is elected out of the malignant damned and defiled world rupertus saith the world surely which god loued we vnderstand to be mankinde that is the liuing and the dead the dead which in faith looked for his comming the liuing who should beleeue in him whether they were of the iewes or of the gentiles for so he saith without any distinction either of iew or gentile vniuersally that euery one that beleeueth in him shall not porish but haue life euerlasting and the common glosse expoundeth the world those that be the elect of the world obiect ii saint paul saith that god will that all man bee saued and come to the knowledge of the truth i answere first that the place is not to be vnderstood of al the posteritie of adam but properly of those which liue in the last age of the world this i proue by coferring of the like places wherein paul doth plentifullie shew his meaning act and the time of this ignorance god regarded not but mark well the rest aining forme of speech for it is as much as if he had said god now willeth that all me shuld repent now hee admonisheth all man euery where to repent rom by the reuelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is opened and publishedfor the obedience of faith among all nation coloss the mysterie which was hid since the world began and from all ages is now made manifest vnto the saints to who god would make knowne christwhom we preach admonishing euery man and teaching euery man that we may present all man perfect in christ iesus and in the second epistle to the corinthian the chap and the second verse he expoundeth that place of isaias where it is said in an acceptable time haue i heard thee and in a day of saluation haue i helped thee and i will preserue thee and will giue thee for a couenant of the people that thou maist raise vp the earththat thou maist say to the prisoners go foorth after this fashion behold now saith hee the accepted time that is the time of the new testament behold now the day of saluation saint peter saith saluation ordained to bee declared in the last times concerning which the prophets which did prophecie of the grace which should afterward come to you haue searched and inquired and christ himselfe saith most plainly of all when i shall be lifted vp from the earth i will draw all things vnto me i therefore grant that god willeth that all should be saued but that god both willeth and that he hath alwaies willed that all man in all ages should bee saued i vtterly denie neither hath paul said so much and among the ancient writers they which seeme to affirme so much doe notwithstanding in these kinde of speeches doubtfully affirme it i doe imagine that it may with reason and religion bee beleeued i doe not thinke it irreligion to beleeue it it may propably and religiously bee beleeued secondly i answer that god will that all man bee saued that is to say of those that are saued so saith augustine euen as it is said that all shall be quickoned in christ although very many be punished by eternall death because all whosoeuer they are that doe receiue eternall life doe not receiue it but in christ so is it said that god will haue all man to be saued although he will haue many not to be saued because all who are saued are not saued but by him willing it and againe when wee reade in the holie scriptures that god will haue all man to bee saued although wee know assuredly that all en are not saued yet ought we not therfore to de gate any thing from the omnipotent will of god but thus to vnderstand that which is written who will haue all man to be saued as if it should be said that no man was saued but hee whom god would haue to bee saued not that there is no man whom he will not haue saued hay o saith god will haue all man to bee saued let vs then aske what is the reason why all man are not saued to which answere must bee made that that saying in the psalm is true he spake the word and they were made in like manner he will saue all man who are saued and who by his mercie desire to bee saued for the apostle put the whole for the part as it is in the gospell where the lord saith if i be lifted vp from the earth i will draw all vnto me for he hath not drawne neither doth hee draw all man vnto him but all that are elect and of all sortes and nation thirdly i answer that god will not haue euery one of euery kind but the kindes of euery one to bee saued that is to say of euery estate and condition some augustine saith this very saying who will haue all man to be saued is so said not because there is no man whom hee would haue damned who would not doe any powerfull miracles among them who hee saith would haue repented if hee had but that wee by all man may vnderstand euery sort of man by what differences so euer distinguished whether they be kings or subiects noble or ignoble high or low learned or vnlearned strong or weake witty dull spirited or foolish rich poore or meane man or woman infants or children youths or yong man middle aged man or old man in all languages in all trade in all conditions in all professions in the innumerable variety of wills and consciences and what other differences soeuer there is among man these things saith hee very truely and rightly for this word all is sometime taken distributiuely and then it signifieth euery seuerall and particular person and paul to the entent that hee might signifie this ioyneth the word euery one with the word all it is also often taken collectiuelie and then it signifieth any and not eueone as when christ is said to haue healed euery disease that is any disease the double signification of this word aristotle also obserued this word all saith he is taken two waies first for euery oneand secondly the word al is vsed when it doth not signifie euery one it is plaine therefore that the word all hath a doubtfull signification and of this minde also is saint ierome it is like vnto that saith he which is in the psalmeeuery man is a lier if euery man be a lier then is he also a lier which speaketh it and if hee bee a lier which speaketh it then is not that true which he speaketh namely that euery man is a lier but if this saying be true these words euerie man doth lye are as i saide before to bee vnderstood after this sort a great part of man are liers and the apostle writeth elsewhere teaching euery ma and again admonishing euery man not that he taught all man for how many are there yet at this day which haue neither heard of the apostles doctrine nor yet so much as his name but that hee should teach and admonish all that are in the church sedulius also saith many and all in paul are one fourthly s paul speaketh in this place according to the charitable iudgement of christians and not according to the iudgement of secret and infallible certaintie like vnto this is that also that he calleth the faithfull in seuerall churches man elected amongst whom there were many which afterward fell away from the faith and yet is not the apostle deceiued for it is one thing to speake according to his owne affection and another thing to speake as the matter is according as it is indeede augustine saith we ought so charitably to be affected as to wish that all man be saued as man that know not who appertaine to the number of those that are predestinated and who doe not and againe we must as much as in vs hath being vnable to distinguish those that are predestinated from those that are not desire that all man be saued and vse sharpe correction vnto all with an entent to heale them that they perish not hence it appeareth what we ought to thinke of damascene his opinion who diuideth the will of god into his precedent and consequent will he calleth that his precedent will whereby god as he that is absolutely good willeth to bestow all good things yes blessednes it selfe vpon the creature and by this will hee affirmeth that god willeth that all man should bee saued and attaine vnto his kingdome because hee made vs not to punish vs but that he might make vs partakers of his goodnesse as being good himselfe but his consequent will is that whereby for some certaine circumstances of the creature he absolutely willeth this or that and by this will hee saith that god willeth that man should be damned for sinne because he is inst and indeede this distinction in it selfe is to be allowed but that is not a very fit example which hee hath set downe or alleaged concerning his precedent will for there seemeth not to bee in god such a will or as they vse to terme it such a wishing will whereby he will indefinitely and vpon condition that all and euery man of all ages should bee saued for first it argueth a finite power and insufficiencie in him that willeth for whatsoeuer any one desireth and earnestly willeth that will be bring to passe vnlesse hee be hindred as for example the merchant desireth and earnestly willeth to saue his ware but being forced by a tempest to the entent that himselfe may escape hee doth absolutely will to cast them into the sea yes indeede this kinde of will seemeth to argue weaknes because god willeth that which shall not come to passe but you will say that this will is conditionall that is that god will that they be saued if they shall beleeue and i say first that the will of god stands doubtfull vntill the condition bee fulfilled amp that the first cause is by this meanes held in suspence by the second causes moreouer there is giuen vnto man a free will either to beleeue or not to beleeue that is flexible and inclinable both waies either by grace or by nature both which things are false as i will afterwards shew and therfore this will is rather a humane will than a diuine heare what anselmus saith the will of god is taken foure manner of waies by the principall doctors first for the knowlddge of god then for the will of the saints who will in charitie that euen the vniust should be saued againe for humane reason and lastly for god commandemets secondly this conditionall will seemeth idle and vnnecessarie especially in him whose power is infinite because if hee earnestly willed hee would verily doe a thing when he might without hindrance thirdly god wil is not such concerning the angels whereby he willeth that all of them should be saued therefore it may well bee demanded whether his will bee such concerning man fourthly if god will that all man as they are man bee saued in like manner hee will that all sinners as they are sinners be damned which is absurd fiftly that will which cannot bee resisted is absolute but god antecedent or first will cannot bee resisted rom for there paul speaketh of the will that goeth before all causes therefore the precedent will is absolute and this will i make manifest after another manner the will of god is that some should beleeue and perseuere and that othersome should bee forsaken either not beleeuing or not perseuering you will aske me happely how i know this i answere by the euent for as touching the euent some beleeue and some doe not beleeue but to beleeue and to perseuere is a certaine kind of good action and on the contrarie not to beleeue or not to perseuere is an euill action and euery thing that is good is through the effectuall will of god and so farre foorth as there is or existeth that which is good so farre foorth god willeth it and maketh it to exist by willing it and that euill which commeth to passe commeth to passe god not hindring it and because god will not hinder it therefore consequently it commeth to passe hereupon it is certaine that god willeth that some should beleeue and perseuere vnto the end and that othersome doe not so yes euen without any condition and no reason can be rendred wherefore he willeth this therefore this will is both absolute and first and therefore that vniuersall precedent will concerning the saluation of all and euery one in christ is counterfeite and fained sixtly the ground of this opinion is that foresaid place of paul which i haue alreadie shewed to be misunderstood and yet that place laieth not down vnto vs any conditional but an absolute will for there it is first affirmed that god will haue all man to be saued afterwards that he will haue all man to come to the knowledge of the truth that is vnto faith because by applying faith to the word of god we acknowledge the truth where is now the that condition of faith lastly against damascene i oppose augustine who to the pelagians vrging this place of scripture god will that all man be saued maketh a double answere first hee denieth that it is not generally to bee vnderstood of the vniuersalitie of man and that by this argument that which god willeth he effecteth but hee doth not generally saue all man therefore hee willeth not secondly hee faith that the place is to be vnderstood of them which are actually saued because all man which are saued are saued by the will of god againe i oppose against him prosper also who saith if the will of god concerning the vniuersall sauing of mankinde and the calling them to the knowledge of the truth is to bee affirmed so indifferent throughout all ages as that it shall be said to ouerpasse no man in what place soeuer god impenetrable and deepe iudgements receiue a great blow and againe wee cannot say that there is the calling of grace whereas there is as yet no regeneration of the mother the church and againe hee forbad the apostles to preach the gospell vnto some people and now as yet he suffereth some people to liue out of his grace also i oppose thomas aq ina against him who saith but such some man god loueth all man whereto i answere that it is true so farre foorth as hee willeth some good to all and yet hee willeth not euery thing that is good to all that is eternall life and therein hee is said to hate and reiect them to conclude i oppose against him hugo de sanct vict who will saith he that all man be saued according to ambrose if they themselues will but are there not many who would be saued and yet are not sauedor thus he offereth grace vnto all by which if they will they may bee saued but how is this solution true are there not and haue there not bin many which neuer heard so much as a word of preaching obiect iii that which euery one is bound to beleeue is true but euery one is bound to beleeue that he is effectuallie redeemed by christ therefore it is manifest that euery one euen the reprobate is effectually redeemed by the death of christ whereto i answere that the termini or parts of the proposition are to be distinguished that which euery one is bound to beleeue is true according to the intention of god that bindeth but it is not alwaies true according to the euent ionas preached and therefore hee was bound to beleeue yet fortie daies and niuiue shall bee destroyed but this was not true according to the euent the assumption also must bee distinguished euerie one in the church by god commandement beleeue the gospell is bound to beleeue that he is redeemed by christ yes euen the reprobate as well as the elect but yet notwithstanding in a diverse and different respect the elect is bound to beleeue that by beleeuing hee shall bee made partaker of election the reprobate that by not beleeuing hee may bee made vnexcusable euen by the intention of god for god sometimes giueth a commandement not that it should be actually done but that man may bee tried that they performe outward discipline and that they may be conuicted of their naturall infidelitie and bee made vnexcusable of all their sinnes before god in the last iudgement for thus i distinguish of god commaundement there is a certaine commaundement of obedience the performance whereof god willeth in all hither are referred the commaundements of the morall law there is also a certaine commaundement of triall as the commaundement of sacrifysing isaac whereas god willeth not the act it selfe but onlie the manifestation of obedience and therefore god must not bee said to mocke man if by the word preached hee doe outwardly call those whom hee will not haue to be saued for by this meanes hee sheweth vnto them the riches of his grace and declareth that they perish by their owne fault because they will not receiue saluation offered but you will say they cannot i confesse as much but that inabilitie whereby they cannot is voluntarie and borne together with vs not infused into vs by god and therefore it cannot be excused very well therefore saith bernard the master knew well that the weightinesse of the commandement exceeded the strength of man but he thought i expedient euen in this that it put them in remembrance of their owne insufficiencytherefore by commaunding things impossible hee makes not man s arners from the trueth but humbleth them that euery mouth may bee stopped so saith augustine de grat amp lib arbit cap secondly i answere that that which euery one is bound to beleeue is true vnlesse any one shall by his owne vnbeleefe hinder himselfe this doth the reprobate by his owne inborne infidelitie thirdly i answer that the argument doth follow twice affirmatiuely in both propositions for the termini or parts of the proposition are thus to bee turned that is true that euery one is bound to beleeue but euery one is bound to beleeue that he is redeemed by christ therfore that is true obiect iiii the fathers which beleeued aright doe affirme that christ redeemed all amp the whole world ans whereas they write that christ redeemed all man and the world their meaning is that hee did it according vnto sufficiencie and the common cause and common nature of all which christ did take vpon him and not effectually on god part this very thing doth prosper make plaine all man saith he are rightly said to be redeemed in respect of the one nature of all and the one cause of all which our lord did truely take vpon him and yet all are not deliuered from captiuitie the proprietie of redemption without doubt belongeth vnto them for whom the prince of the world is sent abroadwhose death was not so bestowed for mankind as that it should also pertaine vnto the redemption of them who were not to bee regenerated and againe he saith our sauiour may fitly be said to be crucified for the redemption of all the world both in respect that he truely tooke vpon him the nature of man and also in respect of the common or generall perdition in the first man and yet he may be said to be crucified only for those vnto whom his death was auaileable moreouer the fathers speake of the vniuersalitie and of the world of beleeuers so saith he that is the author of the calling of the gentils the people of god saith he haue their fulnesse and thus much for the efficacie and greatnesse of christs death now as concerning grace i say that that is diuerslie distinguished for first it is either restrayning or renewing the restrayning grace is that whereby the inbred corruption of the hart is not therby vtterly diminished and taken away but in some is restrained more in some lesse that it breake not violently forth into action and it is giuen onely for a testimonie vnto man and to preserue order amongst man in a politic societie and this kind of grace is generall that is belonging to all and euery man amongst whome some doe exceed othersome in the giftes of ciuill virtue and there is no man in whom god doth not more or lesse restraine his naturall corruption now renewing or christian grace as auncient writers doe vsuallie call it is that whereby man hath power giuen him to beleeue and repent both in respect of will and power and it is vniuersall in respect of those that beleeue but indefinit in respect of all and euerie man thus we teach thus we beleeue secondly grace is either naturall or supernatural as augustine himselfe teacheth naturall grace is that which is bestowed on man together with nature and this is either of nature perfect or corrupt perfect as the image of god or righteousnesse bestowed on adam in his creation this grace belonged genenerally vnto all because we all were in adam and whatsoeuer hee receiued that was good he receiued it both for himsel and his posteritie the grace of nature corrupted is a natural inlightning whereof john speaketh he enlightneth euery man that commeth into the world yes and euery naturall gift and these gifts truly by that order which god hath made in nature are due and belonging vnto nature but that grace which is supernaturall is not due vnto nature especially vnto nature corrupted but is bestowed by speciall grace and therefore is speciall this the ancient writers affirme augustine saith nature is common to al but not grace and he only acknowledgeth a twofold grace namely that common grace of nature wherby we are made man and christian grace wherby in christ we are againe borne new me and hee is of opinion that some that doe not beleeue in christ do not sinne which is a thing notwithstanding very vngodlie and vntrue if grace bee as generall as nature let vs well weigh his words in that he hath saith he added now they are inexcusable for their sinne it may mooue man to aske whether those vnto whom christ hath not come nor spoken may haue any excuse for their sinneto this question according to my vnderstanding i make answer that they cannot bee inexcusable for euery sinne which they haue committed but for this sinne that they haue not beleeued vnto whom christ did not come and vnto whom hee did not speake but they are not in this number vnto whom hee hath spoken in his disciples and by his disciples which he also now doth for he came vnto the gentils by his churchit remaines for vs to demaund whether they can haue this excuse which haue bin or are preuented by death before christ came in his church to the gentiles and before they heard his gospell i answere that without doubt they may but they cannot therefore escape damnation for whosoeuer haue sinned without the law shall also perish without the law againe hee saith onely grace distinguisheth those that are saued from those that are damned who were enwrapped in one lumpe of corruption by one common cause from the beginning chrysostom saith the grace of god commeth vnto euery one but it remaineth with them who doe worthily fulfill those things which are in their power departing quickely from them which doe not wel behaue themselues neither doth it at all come vnto those who doe not so much as begin to turne vnto the lord gregorie saith the gentiles did not any way worship god neither shewed they any signe or token of any good worke for indeede they were but if grace be vniuersall there had alwaies been some church among the gentiles although secret and hidden for it is not likely that all had cast away grace or that they had vsed it uilly expos in regina cap forsaken amongst who because there was no lawgiuer nor no one that did according to reason seeke after god there was not as it were a man but all liued as it were like beast and afterwards he saith when our redeemer came he so receiued the calling of grace as that there was not before in it the life of prophecie and againe teachers holding their tongues the diuels goe into their place because none doe perish by the silence of the pastours but they who are not predestinated vnto eternall life for they are places for the diuels because in god foreknowledge they are not preordained vnto god taber acle hereupon is it said that when the p stours did preach as manie as were predestinated vnto eternall life did beleeue and hereupon saith paul whom hee hath predestinated those hath he called herevpo it is that the apostles desirous to go into asia were forbidden by the holy ghost they therefore which are not predestinated whether they heare the words of the preachers or whether they do not heare them cannot be called vnto god tabernacle and againe sometimes the preachers are silent by god dispensation that they holding their peace they which are not the lordes may be receiued of euill spirits beda saith he goeth to visit and enlighten their harts whom he hath predestinated to eternall life forsaking those whom he kneweth to be none of his owne anastasius saith the church in the former state of error being without eyes and blind did neither see from the beginning neither was it seene a all by god and againe all other kindes of faith which are in the world are dead as so the motions of those people and gentiles which are dead as they which had not in them him who said i am the life neither doe they regenerate and quicken their people and children by the wombe of water and the spirit but are fruitlesse and bere of the well of life and n t enioying the water which is liuely and streameth vnto eternall life therefore that church which is his is onely termed the life and mother of all the liuing hugo de sanct vict saith some of those who were before the comming of christ if they had not had some other sinne they should noo haue been damned for that they did not beleeue in christ because they haue an excuse for that sinne and againe what if thou shouldest enter into consideration how many and how excellent in comparison of thee are cast awaies which could not attaine vnto this grace which is giuen vnto thee surely thou hast heard how many generations of man from the beginning euen vntill this day haue passed away who are all without the knowledge of god and the price of his redemption tumbled downe into the gulfe of euerlasting destruction thy red emer and louer hath preferred thee before all those in as much as he hath giuen thee this grace which none of them was worth e receiue and what wilt thou say wherfore doest thou think that thou are preferred before them all hast thou been more valiant hast thou bin more wise hast thou inne more noble hast thou in more rich then they all because thou hast obtaitained this spee all fauour aboue them all how many valiant man how many wise man how many noble man how many rich man haue there bin and yet they are all forsaken and haue p shed like cast ayes thou only receiued before them all and yet thou can ot finde out any cause why thou shouldest thus be withall besides the free fa our of thy saniour hithe i haue opened and defended our opinion of pred stination i will now ri fely examine another di enting with this in many things hauing taken it with as much diligence as i could out of the publique writings of many en and to this end i doe thus briefly propound it first god created all and euery man in to eternall life secondly he foresav the fall thirdly because he is by nature gentle and good he doth eriooshe will that all man after the fall should be saued and come to the knowledge of the truth and therefore willeth to giue all the furthe ances both of nature and grace that they may be saued but yet indefinitely if they themselues shall beleeue this will of god they say is predes ination and the same with the writte gospell the rule of this wil is whosoeuer shal beleeue shal be saued he that wil not beleeus shall be d mned lastly election is according to the foreknowledge of future faith which notwithstanding may be lost vtterly for a time as some say or finallie and for euer as some others will and reprobation is according to the foreknowledge of infidelitie or the contempt of the gospel this platforme is in very truth so far as i can iudge of is by the scriptures a meere inuention of mans wit which will appeare by the manifold errours therein contained first by this platforme or groundwork there followeth a certaine vniuersall reprobation and that a very absurd and strange one for if there bee as they doe affirme an vniuerfall election whereby god willeth that all man shall be saued in definitely if they doe beleeue he willeth also by the like reason that all and each one should be daned if they do not beleeue but this reprobation is no where to be found in the scriptures yes hence refolloweth that god being alike affected to all and seriously willing the conuersion and saluation of all doth neither chuse nor refuse any man from hence also it followeth that god hath in vaine propounded with himselfe the supreme amp absolute end of his counsels which is to communicate his goodnesse in true selicitie euen to enery man for if we consider the cuent he doth not communicate his goodnesse and eternall life vnto very many which is otherwise than he purposed namely vnto those that are damned but we are in no case to say that the supreme end of god counsels either haue an vncertaine euent or are in vaine propounded thirdly this platforme attributed vnto god a certaine ordered and fitted will which doth wholy depend on mans will thou saist that god willeth that all man whatsoeuer should bee saued by christ very well tell me therefore why they are not saued they themselues will not thou first yes wis what is this but to set the creature in the throne of almightie god the creator against the order of nature and of all causes for the first cause which indeede is god will ought to order and dispose the act of the second cause and therefore wee must not giue vnto god a will that is ordered by the will of the creature especially considering that all order in heauen and in earth whatsoeuer proceedeth from him that which ordereth all things is ordered of none moreouer man after this sort are elected of themselues by receiuing of god grace being offied by the assistance of common grace and are also reiected of themselues by refusing of grace offred and man themselues shall be the makers and framers of their owne election and reprobation and god who chuseth is not so much to be praised as the man that do receiue and embrace the blessing offered fourthly this platforme laies downe a determinate spreknowledge about the euill of fault without any decree going before concerning the euent of the fault which cannot be a definite foreknowledge is not the cause of that thing which is to be but the thing which shal be is the cause of the foreknowledge thereof for the thing which shall be followes not the foreknowledge of it but foreknowledge followeth the thing which shall be as iustinus taught for god doth first decree a thing as touching the euent then afterwards hee doth foreknew by his definite foreknowledge that it shall be and anselme in that saith he a thing is said to be foreknowne it is by that pronounced that it shall be and augustine before his time affirmed that god doth foreknow that which shall be hence it followeth that a thing must oxist with god before it can be precisely and definitly knowne before and euery thing existeth and is because god did will and decree to doe it if it be good or to suffer it to be done if it be euill haue respect alwaies to the good that is ioyned with it vnlesse wee shall hold and grant this it will follow that something hath being of it selfe that is that something is a god therefore the existencie or being of things doth not goe before but out of all doubt followes the decree of god for first of al there is a foteknowledge or as it pleaseth others a knowledge of beholding whereby god beholdeth and seeth what is possible to bee and what not then followeth the decree either of god operation or of his voluntarie permission and consequently of the euent of the thing and this decree being once laid down the definitiue foreknowledge is conceiued whereby it is knowne what shall come to passe infallibly the fifth desect in this platforme is that it teacheth that christ for his part hath redeemed and reconciled all and euery man to god and that very many of them for all that as touching the euent are damned which is very absurd for if this were so sinne satan death and hell should be more mightie than christ the redeemer and as augustine saith vitio humano vincitur deus god is ouercome by mans sinne if thou wilt say that god is not ouercome yet i say and that according to this platforme that he is altered for hee hath decreed and seriously willed to saue all man and yet not withstanding another sentence being giuen he willeth to destroy those which will not incline and bend themselues to this counsell this platforme maketh sauing grace which indeed is supernaturall to be altogether vninersall but this opinion to speake no hardlier of it is a plausible deulse of mans braine for first of all hereby the speciall couenant made with abraham and the greatnesse of god metcies towards the gentiles is abolished and there is no mysterie of the vocation of the gentiles if all and euery particular man were by certaine meanes called vnto christ from the beginning for those which shall by the helpe of common grace which they shall receiue giue assent vnto god calling them whether it bee by extraordinary instinct or by the ministerie of the word preached they shall bee accounted among the members of the church and shal belong to the speciall couenant of the gospell moreouer if the first grace bee vniuersall it is either faith actually or in power for without faith it is impossible to please god and to attaine saluation but actuall saith is not common to all the power of faith is double the first is that whereby thou hast receiued power to bee able to beleeue if thou wilt but this is not sufficient vnto saluation because now after adams fall free will in spirituall things is wanting especially in the conuersion of a sinner and therefore further grace is required whereby a man may he able to will to beleeue no man can come to christ but is drawne of the n they are not drawne to beleeue if they will of man willing a ma lling the second power is that by a man hath receiued power to ll to belee but this is not common to all man you saith christ to his discipl s it gi know the mysteries of the kingd e of heauen but not so sho because the father hath idd them from the wise againe therfore could they not beleaue because isa foretold this furthermore if this power were common to all and to each person faith were common to all for the will and the deede sloweth from one and the selfe same grace philipp it is god who worketh yo the will and the deed euen of good pleasure john wh s uer hath heard and learned of the f ther vnto christ but whosoever hath power to will to beleeue hath heard and learned as being drawne of god therefore whosoeuer hath power to will to beleeue commeth vnto christ well saith ausien it followeth not that hee which can c me doth come vnlesse hee both will do i euerie one that hath learned of the father hath not only power to c me bu also he doth where now there is amp possibili profect amp affectus amp effectus est so it appeareth that to wil to beleeue and actually to beleeue are most neerely conioyned yes seriouslie to will to beleeue is i very deede to beleeue the publican and ha ts and those which are held captiue at the diuels will doe repent and are conuerted and therefore they doe not onely receiue power if they will but of illers and st bbor e r pugners they are made actually willing thirdly there are and haue been many nation which have had no knowledge of the faith or which haue not kept it and without this knowledge there is not any sauing grace answer is wont to be made that man receiuing naturall light is not to bee excused for the want of supernaturall knowledge because if he would doe by god assistance that which liech in him god would enlighten him with supernaturall grace for thus the sch olemen do vsually speake although no man is able by the ministry of man to know the nature of faith of e neuer heard any thing of it yet he may by god helpe if hee liue morally according to god law so much as in him lieth to doe for then god will succour him either by himselfe or by some other to wi either man or angell by propounding of faith vnto him for as in naturall things so in supernaturall god doth minister grace when man is not wanting to himselfe i answere that this is false for if grace be giuen to him which doth that which lieth in him to do by the strength of nature it is giuen either by merite or promise not by merit because there is no merit before faith and we do nothing acceptable vnto god before wee haue faith augustine thou bringest in a kind of man which can please god without the f th of christ by the law of nature this is the cause why the christian church doth especially detest you and it is not giuen by promise because there is no promise or diuine law to bee found in the scriptures that grace should by and by bee giuen vnto him that doth that which lieth in him to doe it is also false to say that god doth minister all things that make for the felicitie of nature or this present life for some are borne lepr us blinde foolish very poore vnmeet for this temporarie felicitie neither do they euer attaine vnto it this opinion also is against experience because many die in their infancie and many are foolish and mad all their life long vpon whom we cannot say that this vu fall grace is bestowed also co rary to most plaine places of ture saluation is not in him that willeth in him that runneth but in god that s weth mercy and he hath mercie on whom he will and whom he will he hardneth it is g uen to the disciples to know the secrets of the kingdome of heauen but to them it is not giuen the wind bloweth not in all but where it listeth the son doth not reueale the father vnto all but to whom he will all doe not beleeue but those which are drawne and predestinated unto life all doe not heare but those to whom eares are giuen for to heare furthermore it is some impayring of effectuall and christian grace so to place it in mans power that hee may if hee will receiue it and that he may also if he will not refuse and despise it and to say that god hath giuen vnto man no other grace then that against which the flesh or peruerse will may preuaile in all man and against which it doth preuaile indeede in the greatest part of mankind because god will not restraine it to conclude let vs also heare the restimonies of the fathers the author of the calling of the gentiles saith thus if so bee that the grace of the sa er doe passe by some as we see it doth it is to be referred to the hidden iudgements of diuine iustice augustine nothing deliuereth vs from this wrath whereby wee are all vnder sinne sauing the grace of god by iesus christ why this grace commeth to that infant and not vnto this the cause may be vnknowne but not vniust againe it was by diuine dispensation that pharaoh did not tractably consent but obstinately resist because that there was not only a iust punishment but a iust punishment euidently prepared for such a heart whereby those which feare god may be corrected againe the iudgements are vnsearchable wherefore of two wicked man being of yeeres aged one should bee called so as that he should follow the caller and the other should either not be called at all or not called so as that he should follow him that calls him and again he giueth to who he will because he is mercifull which though he should not giue yet he is iust againe he doth not giue to the to whom he will not that he might make knowne the riches of his glorie vpon the vessels of mercie for by giuing vnto some wh deserue nor he will haue it to be his free and by this also his true grace and fa r againe whosoeuer are set apart from originall damnation through the boun e of god grace it is no doubs but that it shall he procured for them to heare the gospell and to beleeue when they heare it againe we know that god grace is not giuen vnto all man and againe why one man is so exhorted that he is perswaded and why it is not so with another o the depth of the riches thomas as he doth not open the eres of all that are blinde nor cure all that are crazie that in those his power might appeare and that in the other the order of nature might hee preserued euen so he doth not by his helpe preuent all that inder grace but some in whom he willeth that his mercie should so also that the order of iustice should be manifested in others isidore spirituall grace is not distributed to all but is only giuen to the elect againe it is giuen to him because he is euill that would be good another neither willeth neither is it giuen him that he might be good cameracensis although god be an vniuersal agent ouer all so as that he giueth vnto all some gifts of grace as being life knowledge ampc yet he giueth some gifts of speciall grace vnto one which he giueth not to another as namely faith and the grace which makes vs gracious and such like which are the effects of predestination finally augustine and almost al the scholemen make two kindes of infidelitie the one negatiue in those which neuer heard the gospell the other priuatiue in those that refuse and contemne the message which they haue heard of christ and it is to be noted that by this distinction they doe consesse that god hath not vouchsafed so much as an outward calling to euery man obiect i the promise of the seed of the woman is made in adam to all and to euery man answer it is made to adam s posterirle indefinitely not vniuersallie when saluation is promised to all man all man are named for a part of man the heads of the nation cain cham esan ampc knew the promised messiah but those which came after knew him not neither had they the meanes how to know him so saith isaias me haue they not knowne of me haue they not heard the nation also next adioyning to the iewes peraduenture heard somthing and had proselytes but the nation a fat off seated in the vttermost parts of the earth had no affaires with the iewes and no proselytes and therefore it is false which some affirme to wit that the chusing of the people of israel was onely a kind of greater curtesie shewed to this nation or a more gentle entreating of it and no peculiar and diverse fauour whereby hee shewed himselfe to be their father and redeemer onely and to make or maintaine a hidden and inuisible church among the gentiles before the comming of christ is altogether to contend against y word god is only knowne in iudah the israelites onely are called my people in hosea and they only were christs sheepfold because christ when hee came made one sheepfold of the iewes and gentiles obiect ii there is infolded in god prouidence that care of god touching all those things which concerne the blessednesse of man but the gentiles knew this prouidence of god and that his goodnes was so great that hee would passe by nothing which might make for the happinesse and saluation of man therefore the gentiles did after a sort obscurely and by an infolded knowledge know the doctrine concerning the redemption of mankind answer this faith of things vnknowne is a cere siction for faith of the owne nature is a certaine knowledge moreouer although the generall doe include in it selfe the species or kinds and the whole his members yet hee which knoweth the generall and the whole doth not by and by know all the kinds and parts thereof the mind may so know the generall that yet for all that it may in the meane time bee ignorant of the speciall kinds thereof wee must therefore beware of the schoolemens opinion who say that saluatio was giuen before christs comming for the implicite or infolded faith concerning the redeemer in generall namely when man did beleeue that there is a god and that hee is a rewarder and the giuer of all gifts which concerne the good either of soule or bodie especially the remedie of sinne but this is nothing else then to imagine a certaine sauing faith amp church which hath no word of god at all either written or any other way reuealed furthermore this is to accuse paul of falsehood who teacheth the contrarie in these words seeing the world by wised me know not god in the wisedome of god it pleased god by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue them that beleeue it is also most certaine that wee ought to know christ the redeemer in speciall this is life eternall that they know thee to be the only very god and whom thou hast sent iesus christ the same affirme the auncient fathers ireneus they being ignorant of that emmanuel who is borne of the virgin are depriued of his gift which is life eternall hietome we cannot bee his sonnes before vnlesse wee receiue the faith and vnderstanding of his son iesus christ augustine saith that those which were iust in old time whatsoeuer they were were deliuered onely by that faith whereby we are deliuered to wit by the faith of christs incarnation againe what trueth soeuer thou sa t was in those which were iust in old time the faith only of the mediatour saueth them who shed his bloud for the forgiuenesse of sinnes obiect iii propositio the power of god is known vnto the gentils rom a i mptio christ is the power of god conclusion therefore christ is knowne to the gentils answer i distinguish of the proposition the power of god is either the power of creation or of redemption the power of god in the creation was knowne vnto the gentiles but not the power of god in the redemption which is christ himselfe the preaching of whom is foolishnesse vnto the world obiect iiii the fathers say that sauing grace is vniuersall first i answere that the sayings of the fathers are to bee vnderstood of the grace of the last time which is common to all man and nation ireneus the lord hath reconciled vs in the last times by his incarnation being made a mediatour betweene god and man reconciling the father vnto allgiuing vnto vs that couersion which is to our creatour origin saith god hath a greater care to saue man then the diuell hath to destroy themthe onely begotten the son of god himselfe i say is present with vs hee defendeth keepeth and draweth vs vnto himselfefor he saith in another place when i shal be lifted vp i will draw all things vnto me chrysostom grace is shed abroad ouer all it passeth by and disdayneth neither iew nor greek nor barbarian nor soythian it is alike affected vnto all it sheweth it selfe gentle vnto all it calleth all with equall honour and lee those who neglect the helpe of grace ascribe this their blindnesse vnto themselues for considering that a way to enter in lieth open vnto al and is forbidden to none some desperately wicked doe refuse to enter through their owne corruption cyrill saith he is the true light and sendeth forth his brightnesse vnto all but as paul saith the god of this world hath blinded the minds of vnfaithfull man that the light of god knowledge may not shine in them ambrose the earth is full of the mercie of god because pardon of sinnes is giuen vnto all the mysticall son of righteousnesse is risen vnto all is come vnto all hath suffred for all and hath risen againe for all and if any beleeue not in christ he depriues himselfe of this generall benefithee shutteth out the grace of common light from himselfe gregorie saith the edioine which is from god meeteth vs in euery place because hee hath both giuen vnto man commandements not to sinne and hath also giuen remedies to him that sinneth lest hee should despaire t eodulus presbyterian hee hath said that both iewes and gentiles should be partakers of grace yet not all but those that beleeue and because grace is common to all not without cause secondly they speake of naturall vocation or of the grace of nature consisting in the reliques of naturall light and vnderstanding in the common gifts of vertues and outward blessings which are testimonies of god prouidence and goodnesse the author of the calling of the gentiles for this cause verily the nation may bee excused which being aliants from the common wealth of israel voyde of hope and without god in this world haue perished vnder the darkenesse of ignorance because this abundance of grace which doth now water the whole world did not slow so pentifully before for there is euermore shewed vnto all man a certaine measure of doctrine from chrysosto saith that the preseruing in the atke is superna gratia grace fro aboue aboue which albeit it proceede from a more sparing and hidden grace yet it is sufficient in the lord iudgement for a for the outward reformat of the life horn in gen lib remedy vnto some and a witnesse vnto all againe who may not easily perceiue that hee neuer denied his diuine goodnes to the posteritie of this brother slayer if he consider how profitable so long patience of god such plentifull store of temporall blessings and such an vniuersall increase of multiplied fruitfulnesse might haue been vnto them which benefits although they wrought o cure and emendment in those whose harts were hardned et they proue that their apostasie was not caused by god again in the farthest parts of the world there bee some nation vnto which the light of sauing grace hath not as yet dawnedvnto whom that paercell of general assistance is not denied which is alwaies from aboue granted vnto ad man although the nature of man hath receiued so sharp a wound that it is not possible for any man to come to the knowledge of god by the helpe of his owne voluntarie contemplation vnlesse the true light dispell the darknesse of the heart which the tust and good god in his vnsearchable iudgement hath not so shed abroad in times past as he doth in these last daies thirdly the fathers speake of the vniuersall aptnesse whereby mans will being by god ordinarie dispensation preuented and helped by the holy ghost may beleeue and bee conuerted which notwithstanding a stone stocke or beast cannot augustine apossibilitie to haue faith is giuen of nature againe hee saith that mans nature is capable of iustification by the grace of the holy spirit againe man may keepe god commandements and beleeue in god if they will because that light enlighteneth euery man which commeth into this world prosper to be able to haue faith is the nature of man but to haue faith is the grace of the faithfull augustine this difference there is between wicked man and the diuels that man though they be exceedingly wicked may bee reconciled if god will shew mercie but there is no conuersion reserued for the diuels now as concerning christian grace whereby a will to bee conuerted and to beleeue actually in christ is giuen vnto man the fathers haue not so much as dreamed that it is common vnto all and euery one which notwithstanding some are not for they say that god hath giuen euery a without exception power to beleeue if hee will himselfe now afraid to affirme in their writings error this platforme teacheth that god foreknowledge of our faith and iusidelitie is the rule of predestination which is vtterly false for first of all the very will is a rule vnto it selfe and the diuine counsels ephesian we were predest ated according to his purpose who worketh all things after the counsell of his owne ll secondly god election is the rule of faith that is to be giue or not giuen rom a resoruation is made according to the election of grace thirdly the foreknowledge of faith and infidelitie doth not extend it selfe so farre as predestination which belongs vnto all man whatsoeuer many of whom notwithstanding neuer so much as heard of christ now these cannot haue faith not contempt of the gospell priuatiue infidelitie but only a negatiue the same i say of those which die in their infancie being within the cou nant who we beleeue are saued by the nour of the same couenant who for all that are neither elected for saith nor according to faith which they as yet had not but if the foreseeing of faith were the rule or square of electio or reprobation the thing foreseen should belong to all man without exception for the rule must not bee ter than that which is ruled by it fourthly foreseene faith is the effect of election therefore it it is not the rule of it ephesian who hath predestinated us vnto adoption by christ and therefore also to faith which receiueth the benefit of adoption augustine let vs therefore saith he vnderstand that calling whereby they are chosen who are choson not because they did beleeue but that they should beleeue for if they were for that cause chosen because they did beleeue they themselues verily had chosen him before by beleeuing in him that they might deserne to be chosen againe lest any man should say my faith or some such like thing doth distinguish me from other man the teacher of the gentiles meeting with such conceits asketh what thou hast that thouhast not receiued and of whom but of him who distinguisheth thee from him to who he hath not giuen that which he hath giue to thee lumb god hath elected those whom it pleased him to elect of his owne free merc not because they were to be beleeuers but that they should bee beleeuers again grace is the effect of predestination fiftly if god did elect according to foreseene faith tell me why he did foresee faith in one man rather then in another tell me i say for here whether thou wilt or no thou must haue recourse to the meere will of god for god doth foresee nothing which is good in any besides that which hee himselfe of his pleasure will first make and what is the cause why he foreseeth faith in one man rather than in another but onely because it is his will to giue one man faith and not an other lastly th rule is vncertaine for faith as appeareth by this platforme may bee vtterly lost and therefore the thing ruled to wit predestination is made uncertaine this a certaine author plainly confesseth in his exposition of the epistle to the romanes where he teacheth vnaduisedly that god decree may be changed and that election and reprobation haue recourse one to another because as he saith they depend vpon the condition of faith and infidelitie furthermore this platforme teacheth that true and sauing faith may perish and be lost either wholly or for euer which notwithstanding is not true reason matth vpon this rock will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it here three questions must be asked what the rock is what is meant by building on the rocke and what is that which is promised to those which are built vpon it the rocke is either faith it self or christ apprehended by faith chrysostom vpon this rocke that is saith he vpon the faith of confession againe he setteth our feete vpon the rocke that is vpon faith for faith in christ may well be said to be that which cannot bee broken againe christ being wise hath built his house that is his church vpon a rocke that is vpon the fortitude of faith or a strong faith now if faith be a rock it remaineth constant and immoueable to be built vpon the rock is to perceiue the doctrine of the gospel to embrace christ our sauiour with a true faith and to cleaue fast to him with the heart for the cori thians are said to bee pauls building because he brought them to the faith and the ephesians are said to be built vpon the foundation of the apostles and prophets because paul came and preached vnto them the gospell of peace the certaintie and firmnesse of the doctrine of the gospell may also bee called a rocke epiphanius they shall not preuaile against the rocke that is to say against the truth hilarie this is thy blessed rocke of faith which peter hath confessed with his mouth augustine vpon this rocke which thou hast confessed i will build my church now no man can be built vpon the confession and vpon the truth but by faith hence i doe conclude thus those that are built vpon the rocke cannot fall away vtterly but those which truely beleeue are built vpon the rocke therefore those which t uly beleeue doe not vtterly and whollie fall away thirdly the promise made to them that are built vpon the rocke is that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against them from hence it followeth necessarilie that the diuels can but make a slorish and shew their strength and power against the faith and that they shall neuer be able to ouercome and conquere let vs here also weigh the iudgements of the fathers cyprian lord to whom shall we goesignifying that the church which beleeueth in christ and which kepeth that which it hath once knowne doth at no time altogether depart from him and that they are the church who doe abide in god house but that they are not of god the fathers plant whom we doe see to be voyd of the stedfastnes and massie soundnes of corne and like to chaffe vanned or blowne about with the wind of the winnowing enemi of whom also john speaketh in his epistle saying they went out from vs but they were not of vs for if they had bin of vs they had surely remained with vs augustine loue which may be lost was neuer true againe to beleeue truly is to beleeue constantly stedfastly valiantlie and firmely so as that thou maist not now returne vnto thine and forsake christ againe those which are truely saints being predestinated to reigne with god by his grace haue not onely giuen them now a power to pers ere if they wil but perseuerace selfe againe hee which makes man good aketh them to perseuere in that which is good and againe the church loseth none on the earth but those which are wicked and admitteth none into heauen but those that are good againe as the a ke was built of foure square timber so the church is builte of saints for that which is foure square will stand steddy on which side soeuer you set it and the saints continue stedfast in euery temptation chrysostom this is the propertie of faith that howsoeuer things may fall out contrarie to the promises yet it neuer falleth away vtterly and is neuer wholy confounded againe let vs keepe faith which is a firme and sure rocke for neither the floods nor the winds can do vs any hurt though they driue hard against vs because we stand stedf st vpon a rocke so also if in this life we will choose that true foundation we shall abide without any detriment or losse againe thou canst not ouercome one faithfull man o diuel thou knowest not what the martyre haue done vnto theethe flesh often fainteth in the torments and the stregth of faith faileth not hence it is that in y e same place he speaketh after this sort if thou makest war with ma thou shalt it may bee ouercome or perhaps thou shalt bee ouercome but no might can ouercome the church furthermore the church is farre stronger than the earth yes and stronger than heauen againe faith in god is a certaine secure anchor gregorie because the light of the elect is not extinguished by temptation wee doe not say there is a night made but an euening namely because temptation doth oftentimes hide the light of righteousnesse in the hearts of the elect but it doth not put it quite out it makes it as it were twinkle and looke wanne but it doth not extinguish it angelome the obseruation of god commandements being established in the hearts of the elect by faith hope and loue of that heauenly recompence can by no let of temporall things bee dissolued againe the hearts of the elect are compared to a foure square figure which haue learned so to remaine in the strength of faith that they cannot be remoued from the certaintie of their estate by any repugnancie of those things they meete with no not by death it selfe andreas those are found to be abortiue or vntimely borne children who haue departed from the true light which is christ thomas if we by the reuelation of our heauenly father shall then confesse namely when our conuersation is in the heauens that iesus christ is the son of the liuing god and if it shall be said vnto vs thou article peterfor euery one that followeth christ is a rocke but he against whom the gates of hell preuaile is neither to be termed the rock whereon christ doth build his church neither the church nor a part of the church which christ buildeth vpon the rocke and againe although thou must be lifted a little yet thou hast the seede of faith hidden in thee though the leaues bee blowne downe with the temptors winde yet the roote is fresh second reason matth leade vs not into temptation ampc that is doe not vtterly forsake vs and deliuer vs vp to satan augustine god leadeth a man into temptation when he suffers him to be tempted that hee may trie him and not destroy him and he deliuereth from euill when he suffers vs not to bee tempted beyond our power gregorie the grace of the holie ghost qualifies the temptations of the aduersarie by dispensation that those which may be may but scorch with their heate and not burne vp with their fire hence i thus reason whatsoeuer wee aske according to god will it shall be giuen vs but wee aske according to god wil that we may not be vtterly forsaken in temptation for our aduocate taught vs so to pray therfore that wee bee not vtterly forsaken in temptation shall be giuen of god now whom god doth not vtterly forsake he doth not vtterly fall away and this christ taketh for granted in the elect matth verse so as that if it were possible they should deceiue the very elect third reason if there be a totall or vtter falling away from a true faith then is there also required a second ingrasting into christ and consequently a seale of the second ingrafting baptizing anew that is to say a abaptisme for so often as we are borne againe we are to be baptized this is augustines ground as the carnall generation is one neither can a man enter into the wombe againe euen so is spirituall regeneration for we are once borne and we are also once borne againe therefore also it is requisite that the sacrament of regeneration bee once receiued if it chance to fall out by sinne that some are weakened who are regenerated they haue neede of cure by repentance and not by baptisme but those that doe vtterly or wholly fall away from faith and grace are the second time to be ingrafted into christ and consequently they are not once regenerated but again and therefore they are oftner than once to be baptized fourth reason ioh whosoeuer is borne of god committeth not sinne because his seede remaineth in him we must here marke that he saith his seede remaineth in him that is to say that it doth not depart nor vanish away and this seede is the very word of god which remaineth in vs by saith and doth not remaine saith being vtterly lost this seede also is immortall because it will neuer perish if it be truly sowne in our hearts a fist reason is taken out of the sixt to the romans propositio if christ hauing once died cannot die any more then wee which are his members being dead together with him shall not die any more in sinne assumptio but christ hauing once died cannot die any more conclusion therefore we which are his members shall not die any more in sinne the proposition is in the eight verse and hath a manifest ground for by the vertue of the mysticall communion which is had with christ by faith his spirituall life which cannot perish flowing into his members maketh them in like manner that they die no more in sinne the assumption is in the and verse the conclusion in the eleuenth moreouer those which are the members of christs bodie shall grow vp vnto a perfect man ephesians and ioh but all those which haue a true faith are members of christs bodie therefore those which haue a true sauing faith shall grow vp vnto a perfect man and therefore those which doe truely beleeue shall not perish but obtaine saluation for the better vnderstanding of this doctrine two things must be sought for first whence it is that faith perisheth not answer if wee consider faith by it selfe that is in the owne nature it may perish and be lost but if we consider the confirming grace which god hath promised to them that bleeue sauing faith doth not perish it is by reason of the second grace freely promised that the first grace doth not perish to you it is giuen for christ that ye should not onely beleeue in him but also suffer for his sake one of these saith augustine belongs vnto the beginning the other to the ende but both are god gift because both are giuen a christian mans beginning is to beleeue in christ and the best end hee can make is to suffer for christ ier i will make an euerlasting couenant with them that i will neuer depart from them to doe them good loe the euerlasting forgiuenesse of sinnes and i will put my feare in their harts that they shall not depart from mee behold the perseuerance of faith and regeneration that shall neuer be lost philipp he that hath begun this good worke in you will finish it vnto the end secondly it may bee demaunded how far e foorth the faithful lose grace and the holy spirit answer distinguish the saithfull and disti ish grace there bee foure sorts of beleeuers the first are they which heare the word and vnderstand it the second are they which do heare vnderstand and for a time approoue it the third are those who do heare vnderstand approne amp bring forth some fruits the fourth are such as do heare vnderstand approue bring forth some fruits and lay hold vpon christ the redeemer by the hand of a li ely f ith vnto saluation these are true be eeuers and cannot vtterlie either fall away from god or perish howsoeuer all other besides these both may and vse to fall away and perish furthermore is either the first or second the first is the free fauour of god who embraceth those that are his being in christ vnto euerlasting life from this grace the faithfull are said to fall after this fashion as soone as they haue committed some haynous sinne against the law of god they doe grieuously offend him god being offended changeth the effects of grace into y e effects of a certain hatred not against the faithfull themselues but against their sinnes and this both within and without within when hee maketh them to feele an accusing conscience amp witnessing that god is displeased and that they are made guiltie of death by their sinne without when they taste of god anger against them in the outward chastiseme s of the bodie and thus far they fall from his herly loue and are become the enemy of god after a sort i say a er a sort because god doth not lay downe his fatherlie affection and doth not alter his purpose of adoption and eternall life although the faithfull do fall away so much as h in them yet god remaineth a father in christ and they also as touching right vnto eternall life remaine sonnes ioh they shall neuer perish neither shall any plucke them out of my hand here some doe say that the sheepe cannot be pluckt out but yet they may of their owne accore s cke away but without reason for the sheepe which reuolteth is pluckt away by the diuell when it doth reuolt and as he which continueth in christs word is verily his disciple so he that doth not fall away but abides a sheepe is verilie a sheepe rom who shall separate vs from the loue of christ rom the gifts and calling of god are without repentance tim the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his second grace is either imputed or inherent imputed is in iustification a part whereof is remission of sinnes and this remaineth and shall foy euer remaine sure as touching sinnes passed that saying of the schoolemen is most true sinnes once forgiuen continue so alwaies but when that any faithful man shall fall grieuously the pardon of that fall is granted in god decree notwithstanding no pardon is actually giuen of god nor receiued of ma vntill he doe repent yes if he should neuer repent which notwithstanding is impossible he should be damned as being guiltie of eternall death by this offence for there is no pardon of any new sinne without a new act of faith and repentance inherent grace is either faith or the gift which followeth faith in sauing faith we must consider the act and the habit the act of faith is the very action of apprehending or an vnfained apprehension of christ now this faith may be lost according to some act the very habit also or power of faith may in it selfe bee lost but by reason of confirming grace faith doth not perish as touching the essence thereof but it is lesned and abated according to some degree and hence it followeth that our communion with christ may bee diminished but that our vnion cannot be dissolued there remained in dauid after his fall the seed of true faith and regeneration as appeareth by his words psalm take not thy holy spirit from me it is also the iudgement of the auncient fathers that the roote of faith in peters fall was not taken away and abolished but only mooued and that it did as it were waxe drie that it was onely shaken and troden on and that it did not vtterly vanish here also we are to giue eare a while to gratian who consenteth with vs and to this purpose hath gathered many testimonies together out of the fathers hath loue saith hee taken roote bee secure no euill can proceed againe loue doth vtterly estrange the mind wherein it hath once taken possession from the delightes of the world againe loue is ioynedto god and vnited inseparably and is alwaies inui cible in all againe loue is an inu sible v ction which sta ds as it were in stead of a roote to him in whom s uer it shall be which cannot wither though the s e doe parch whatsoeuer is r d is nourished with the heate of the and doth not w rher againe hee lookes backe after the plough who after that hee hath begun to doe good workes returnes to evil which he did forsake which in no wise befalleth to the elect againe all the elect doe so goe forward vnto good things that they do not returne to the committing of euill and againe the fitting and mouing of the spirit may be thus vnderstood for as touching some virtue it doth alwaies abide in the hearts of the saints but according vnto other it comes as that which will returne and eturnes as purposing to come for as c ning faith hope and charitie and other graces without which it is not possible to come to that heauenly country as namely humilitie chastitie iustice and mercie it neuer forsaketh their hearts that are vpright but as touching the vertue of prophecie the eloquence of doctrine and working of miracles it is sometimes present with the elect and sometimes it withdrawes it selfe the schoolemen alledge augustine to the contrary opinion where hee saith that doubtlesse if the man which is renewed and iustified doe fall backe by his owne will vnto an euill life he cannot say i haue not receiued because he hath by his owne free will vnto euill lost the grace of god which hee did receiue and againe that god doth not giue the gift of perseuerance vnto some of his children whom he did regenerate in christ and to whom hee gaue faith hope and loue but he speaketh not these things of those which are indeede the sonnes of the promise but of those which are so called of vs and which beare the name and profession of sonnes furthermore he speaketh of such as haue faith and loue in opinion and imagination and truely also as touching outward practise or augustine in the same place hath so expounded his meaning we must beleeue that some of the sonnes of perdition doe he speaketh of the iustice of life and not of the inwarde righteousnes of the heart tract in iob epistle begin to liue and for a time faithfully and iustly in the faith that worketh by loue and afterwards fall thirdly he speaketh of faith and loue as they are imperfect vertues and as it were lately sprung vp and not as they are sound perfect and true to wit as touching the truth of their essence so augustine loue is sprung vp within thee but it is not yet persi ed doe not despaire but nourish it lest it be sti ed and gratian this loue which was an herbe in peter before his deniall and which springeth vp in euery one is lost and repaired before it be strengthened and made perfect and indeed for the manifesting of the truth of faith and loue there is required perseuerance by which it might bee knowne that these and such like vertues haue taken deep roote in the heart and are grounded vpon an earnest and constant affection that they may neuer be ouercome of temptations obiect i sin and the grace of the holy spirit cannot stand together ans this is true of the sinne that ra gneth or which is committed with full consent of will but the regenerate do not sinne with a whole or full will and i lay this foundation of this our iudgement in tentation we must consider two things the beginning or ground and the degrees the ground is our owne concupiscence that is our inbred corruption the subiect thereof is the whole man but especially the faculties of mans soule the mind will and affections and in these it doth immediatly exist and reigne alone before a sinner bee conuerted and a man being not regenerated be he what he will be he is flesh euery iot of him but after that a man is regenerated the flesh is no more alone or seuered by it selfe but mixed with the spirit and the spirit with the flesh although both these qualities remaine as touching nature distinct in one subiect as in the twilight the light doth not appeare alone but with darkenesse and darkenesse is not alone but with the light and the man that is regenerated is not onely flesh nor onely spirit nor flesh in one part and spirit in another but the whole man is flesh in euery part and the whole man is spirit in euery part and because those things which are contrarie cannot consist together in the highest degrees therefore albeit the whole man bee flesh yet he is not flesh in the highest degree nor spirit in the highest degree but in remisse and lower degrees partly flesh and partly spirit as luke warme water is remissely and indifferentlie colde thoroughout and remissely also hot thoroughout hence it followeth that concupiscence may exist and bee with the grace of the holy spirit so that it beare not rule the degrees of tentation are as iames teacheth in number sine the fi abstraction or drawing away when the mind receiueth a thought cast into it about the committing of euill and by this meanes suffers herselfe to bee drawne away fro her duty to other things the second is inescation or entising when the mind conceiueth a morose thought for the committing of sinne together with a certaine delectation of the affection as when fish delight themselues with the bait hanging vpon the hooke thus farre all diuines think a regenerate man may come and it is most certaine for hence it is that paul complaineth that hee was held captiue of sinne the third degree is conception namely when there is a will consent and a purpose to commit euill and when corruption doth come thus farre there bee some that say that all repentance and faith is driuen out and gone but not truely there is indeed in the vnregenerate in whom sinne reigneth a full consent but in the regenerate in whom the flesh and the spirit are two contrarie foundations of actions the consent is more remisse and vnperfect for they doe so will as that they nill and so nill as that they will as paul hath taught by his owne example the fourth degree is birth of sinne when after consent an euill is actually committed and in this act the same man being regenerate doth at the same instant both sinne and not sinne he sinneth onely according vnto the flesh and in that part wherein he is renewed hee doth not sinne but before and after the fact detesteth his sinne and as when the spirit preuaileth the action is not free from all pollution of the flesh so when the flesh preuaileth the action is not so corrupt in the regenerate as it is in those in whom sinne reigneth neuerthelesse i confesse that in euery grieuous fall the flesh doth get the masterie and that the gift of true faith after the receit of the wound lieth flat and in a swoone for a time but that it is not for all that abolished and quite put out the last degree is perfection namely when sinne being perfited and ripened by often iteration and custome groweth as it were vnto a habit so saith gregorie sin alwaies is finished in a worke by those same foure waies for first the sinne is committed closely after that it is discouered in the sight of man without blushing at the fault then it is brought into a custome and at the last either it is nourished with the deceit of vaine hope or with the obstinacie of wretched despaire and isidore action bringeth foorth custome and custome necessitie and so a man being fettered with these linkes lieth fast bound as it were with a chaine of vices this last degree befals not the regenerate and if it did saith and the holy spirit should be shaken out and banished obiect ii adam when he was voide of corruption sell wholly away therefore much more they who being borne and regenerated after adam shall beleeue answer the reason is vnlike for wee haue saith augustine by this grace of god in the receiuing of that which is good and in the constant keeping of the same not onely power to doe that which we will but also will to doe that which we can which adam wanted for one of these was in him but the other was not for to receiue good he wanted not grace because as yet hee had not lost it but to continue in it he wanted the helpe of grace without which he was not able at all to doe it and he receiued power if he would but he had not will answerable to his power for if it had been in him hee should haue perseuered obiect iii propositio the member of an harlot cannot be the member of christ assumptio but he which beleeueth truly who is actually a member of christ may be the member of an harlot conclusion therefore one that truly beleeues may come to be no member of christ ans the member of christ is diuersly distinguished for there is either a true or an apparent member an apparent member is that which is not a member according to election nor in it selfe but in shew onely that is iudged by meanes of outward profession to bee in the visible church and it is like a woodden legge fastned to the bodie by article a true member is either by destination and appointment or now actually one members by appointment are all those who are elected although they be not as yet regenerated or borne an actuall member is either one that is liuely or halfe dead a liuely member is that which is according to election and in very deede ingrafted into christ and ruled by his spirit that is an halfe dead member which doth indeede belong to god election and is ingrafted into christ but yet being hurt by some grieuous fall hath so much as in it is lost the grace of the holy spirit now i answere to the proposition first a member of christ in shew may be the m mber of an harlot as a woodden foote which is indeede the member of some image may be an apparent member of a mans bodie whereto it is fitted by arte secondly a member of christ by appointment in god decree may be the member of an harlot as paul who was separated from the wombe was for a time a member of satan persecuting the church thirdly he which is a liuely and actiue member of christ and so continueth cannot be the member of an harlot but a member that is crazie and halfe dead may be for howsoeuer he remaineth in christ in respect of incorporation and the mysticall vnion yet hee is out of him as touching the force and efficacie of the spirit which for a time through his owne default hee doth not perceiue vntill he doe repent a leg that is troubled with the pals e or receiueth no nourishment is a true legge because in respect of vnion it is incorporated into the bodie howsoeuer it hath almost lost all communion and fellowship with the rest of the members neither must this which i say seeme strange that the member of christ may in some sort bee the member of an harlot because the coniunction is not of the same kinde the coniunction with christ is spirituall but that which is with an harlot is corporall this platforme giueth vnto euery man a free will flexible and inclinable to both parts by grace and teacheth that it is in mans will to apply himselfe to grace being giuen by the help of vniuersall grace or to reiect the same through the weaknes of corrupt nature but this is false for the first vniuersall grace is not effectuall vnlesse it be confirmed by the second grace following it as for example if a man shall receiue power to beleeue if he will yet he shall neuer actually and indeede beleeue except there be also giuen the helpe of the other grace which bringeth the former into act but this second grace is not giuen to all and euery one moreouer this opinio is repugnat to very plain places of scripture iere i will make an euerlasting couenant with the that i will not turne away from the to do them good and i will put my feare in their hearts that they shall not depart from me againe corinthian god shall confirme you vnto she end blamelesse god is faithfull by whous ye are called vnto the fellowship of his son iesus christ our lord it is also contrarie to christs speech ioh e eery man that hath heard and hath learned of the father commeth vnto me this grace saith augustine which is secretly infused into mens hearts by god liberalitie is refused of no hard heart and afterward if it had pleased the father to teach them to come vnto christ who accounted the word of the crosse foolishnes without all doubt they also would haue come why doth he not teach all if we shall say because they will not learne whom he doth not teach it will be answered vs and where is that which is said vnto him thou o lord conuertest and quicknest vs againe the effect of god mercie cannot be in mans power so as that hee should shew mercie to him in vaine if man be vnwilling because if he would haue mercie on them he could call them so as they should be fitted to moue vnderstand and follow and againe god sheweth mercie to none in vaine but vnto whom he sheweth mercie him he calleth so as hee knoweth to be sitting for him that hee may not reiect him who calles him neither doe i here respect the distinction of sufficient and effectuall grace for i acknowledge no grace sufficient for the conuersion of a sinner which is not effectuall as i haue alreadie said before because free will is altogether wanting in spirituall things we are starke dead in sinnes and our sufficiencie is whollie from god therefore there is in vs beside the want of originall righteousnesse a three fold impotencie the first is that whereby wee are vnable to receiue or desire supernaturall grace offered by god the second is that whereby wee are vnable to vse it lawfullie the third is that whereby we are vnable to retaine and keepe it and therefore there are certaine degrees of grace to bee bestowed in the true conuersion of a sinner in respect of which augustine makes a fiuefold grace preuenting preparing working coworking and the gift of perseuerance preuenting grace is that whereby god inspireth into the mind of the sinner that is to bee conuerted good thoughts a good purpose and a desire of supernaturall grace the meanes whereby preuenting grace is giuen is the voyce and preaching of the gospell by the which being heard and thought vpon the holy ghost doth shew forth his efficacie and power for hence it is that the gospell is called the ministerie of the spirit corinthian and that faith is said to be by hearing rom therefore they which are out of the church do want the preuenting grace vnlesse it bee extraordinarily coferred which yet is very seldome done preparing grace is that whereby it is giuen vs to consent vnto god offring grace or whereby the mind and wil are prepared that they may yeeld assent and obedience to the holy spirit for as all supernaturall grace in respect of god donation is altogether from him euen so wee obtaine our consentment and power to receiue grace conferred no otherwise then by the gift of god working grace is that wherby we are deliuered from the dominion of sinne and are renewed in minde will and affection hauing receiued power to obey god coworking grace is that whereby god conferreth and perfitteth the grace of renewing being receiued and without this grace following the first is vnprofitable for when grace is giuen by god and receiued of vs by the second grace wee doe not vse it lawfully but by this third grace augustine saith well if in so great weakenesse of this life the will renewed should bee so left vnto the regenerat that they may remaine in god helpe if they themselues will and if god should not make them for to will among so many and so mighty temptations the will would faint by reason of the weakenesse thereof mans weakenesse therefore is relieued that through the grace of god there should be will inseparably annexed to the power and therefore the will though it bee but weake yet should not for all that faint and be ouercome by aduersitie againe therefore that we may will he worketh without vs but when we will and so will that we l e also he coworketh with vs yet notwithstanding without him working that wee may will or coworking when we do will we haue no power to performe the good workes of godlinesse the gift of perseuerance is that whereby after that we haue receiued the grace of renouation we do also receiue a will to perseuere and continue constantly in that good which we can doe hierome that sufficeth me not which he hath once bestowed i aske that i may receiue and when i shall receiue i aske againe these fiue graces speken of euen now being taken seuerally and asunder by themselues are not sufficient vnto saluation for the preuenting grace is nothing auaileable without the preparing grace and the working grace without the coworking grace yet being ioyned together they are sufficient and hence it plainely appeareth that there is not any grace truely sufficient vnto the saluation of a sinner that is starke dead in sinnes the which is not also effectuall if so much strength we giuen to one that would lift vp a mightie burthen as were sufficient that is so much as did exceede the weight of the thing that is to be lifted vp out of al doubt motion would follow it would come vp so if god doe giue so much grace as is sufficiet that is as would ouercome the hardnesse of the heart the corruption thereof could not possibly hinder it from being conuerted moreouer if these fiue graces do concurre in the conuersion of a sinner the regenerate person shal not haue free will flexible alike either to good or euill neither shall it be in our choice to obey or resist the motion of the spirit yes from hence it followeth that it multiplieth grace and that the wil is so effectually ruled by it in those that are truely conuerted as that they follow faith and godlines with an inflexible and stedfast affection the spirit promised vs of god doth not enable vs to walke if we will but makes vs walke indeed those which are drawne haue not onely power to run if so bee that they themselues will but they run indeed after christ hee which is borne of god sinneth yes hee cannot sinne furthermore perseuerance in faith doth wholly depend vpon god will as these words of paul doe shew i haue reserued vnto my selfe seuen thousand man which haue not bowed the knee vnto baal and those which doe truely beleeue haue receiued of god both power to perseuere in grace if they will and also will to doe that which they haue power to doe so augustine there is in vs by this grace of god which is by christ in receiuing of good and in the constant keeping of the same not onely power to doe that which we will but will to do that which we haue power to doe therefore those that doe truely beleeue cannot but perseuere obiect i isaiah o inhabitant of ierusalem amp ye man of i dah iudge betweene me and my vineyard what could i haue done any more vnto my vineyard that i haue not done vnto it why haue i looked that it should bring forth grapes and it bringeth forth wild grapes these iewes therefore had the helpe of god which was thoroughly sufficient vnto conuersion and the leading of a life acceptable to god answer go eaketh in this place of the so hierom on this place oquitur de sufficientia externorum m rum non inter gratiae sufficiencie of outward meanes that is of the preaching of his word of his benefits and chastisements whereby they were sufficiently inuited and lead vnto saluation but that they were of such p ish and peruerse dispositions god therefore did that to this wicked vineyard which if hee had done in a good vineyard it would haue brought forth the fruit of obedience and heere he speaketh not of the sufficiencie of inward grace whereby an euill vineyard might be changed into a good vineyard thou w lt say that god then hath no iust cause to expostulate with the iewes that they brought not forth fruite because he gaue them not grace to repent and bring forth fruit which could by no meanes bee had if he doe not giue it i answer that god could not iustly haue expostulated with the iewes if hee had owed them grace and being bound to giue it had not guen it if they had not cast away the grace which they reciued in their first parents by which they might haue brought forth fruit beseeming repenta if he had denied them being anew desirous to receiue the grace which now is lost but god is bound to no man and wee haue cast away that grace which was bestowed in adam and wee doe not desire nor care for it being cast away therfore god doth most iustly expostulate with vs if we bring not forth fruit obiect ii matth how often would i haue gathered thy children together and thou wouldst not how did christ will and so will that he complaineth of those who would not if hee had not through his helpe made them able will whom he knew could not will answere christ is heere said to haue willed to gather them together not by the will of his good pleasure which may neuer be resisted but by his signifying or reuealed will for hee is said to will to gather all vnto himselfe because by the preaching of the word hee calleth all in commune vnto saluation and prefixeth to himselfe this end of preaching that they should commit themselues to his protection and fidelitie by this will therefore hee may will to gather the iewes together though in the meane time hee doe not helpe them that they themselues may be able to will and he doth also iustly complaine of those that will not because mens impotencie to that which is good and their bondage vnder sinne whereby they are made to nill and vnable to will that which is good commeth not from the creator but from him who of his owne accord fell away from the creator secondly i say that christ is heere said to haue willed not as hee is god effectually mollifying and conuerting the hearts of man but as he was a minister of the circumcision whiles hee sought the conuersion of the iewes by preaching a place altogether like is in act where the iewes are said to haue rushed against or resisted the holy ghost but these words are to be vnderstood not in regard of the inward and effectual operation of the spirit but in respect of the outward ministery of the prophets it pleased lumbard also to interpret this place how often would i haue gathered thy children and thou wouldst not thus so many as i haue gathered together i did it by my effectuall will thou being vnwilling obiect iii revelation i stand at the dore and knocke if any shall open it vnto me i will come in vnto him therefore all at whose dore christ knocketh haue sufficient grace whereby they are able to open if they will hee is vnwise that knocketh at the dore if he know assuredly that there is no bodie within that is able to open it answere this place fauoureth not vniuersall grace for these at whose dore christ knocketh are chose which beleeue and are conuerted and hee knocketh at their hearts partly by his word partly by afflictions that hee might stir vp their languishing faith and increase and confirme his fellowship with them you may read the like in cant open vnto me my sister my loue my doue tenthlie this platforme disagreeth with it selfe for it saith that god doth conferre vnto all man all the helpes of nature and grace and that he is not wanting to any so but that he may obtaine saluation but i say and that out of this platforme that god is wanting to some offendors because he giueth them onlie a power to perseuere in faith if they will or if you had rather a power to will to perseuere and maketh the not to perseuere actually and indeed and vnlesse this grace be giuen it is not possible that anie should obtaine saluation by perseuering for it is a most sure rule a man doth not that good thing which by grace he is able for to doe vnlesse god make him to doe it as he hath made him able to doe it if hee will therefore hee to whom the verie act of perseuerance is not giuen being smitten with the violence of some grieuous temptation without delay will fall away from faith and shall bee damned lastly this hypothesis or platforme is but the varnishing and fresh trimming ouer of certain opinions which the church in former ages did condemne the pelagians taught that all man were redeemed by christ but not made free because god distributed his gifts according to the capablenes of the which came to receiue them the same did faustus the pelagian also affirme how hath god saith he redeemed all the world doe wee not see man to line still in their sinnes how shall wee thinke that they are ransomed whom wee doe see still to continue captiues let vs gather that which is here mens by vsing a similitude as for example if any embassadour or priest purposing to make intercession for a citie taken by war shall bestow a very great ransome and set free from his seruitude who is the chiefe commander all the multitude which is in captiuitie in so much that they are altogether deliuered from all constraint on necessitie of bondage and then if happily either their vsuall delight or some soothing slaue shall so instantly vrge some of the captiues as that euery one turning servant and slaue to his owne will shall refuse that freely bestowed benefit shall we say that the contempt of the vnthankefull captiue hath lessened the estimation of the ransome or that he which refuseth libertie doth any way diminish the good will of him that ransometh surely no for euen as hee which returneth may bee well accepted with him that doth ransome him so is hee guiltie of contempt who did not returne thus we see that the pelagians did forge or frame a redemption through christ without deliuerance and what else doe they who publish in their pamphlets that all and euery one on god part are redeemed but not saued because they will not beleeue and now let vs heare the confutation of this opinion augustine saith you say they are redeemed but they are not deliuered they are washed but they are not clensed these bee your monstrous opinions these are the paradoxes of the pelagian heretikes ampc but i pray thee tell me how can this redemption be vnderstood if he doe not redeeme from euill which redeemed israel from all their sinnes for wheresoeuer we make mention of redemption there also is vnderstood a ransome and what is that but the precious blood of the imma ulate lambe christ iesus and concerning this ransome why should we aske any other wherefore it was giuen let him that gaue the ransome let him that paid the price make the answere this is saith he my blood which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes proceede i pray proceede and as you say in the sacrament of our sauiour man are baptized but they are not saued they are redeemed but they are not deliuered so say you also christs blood is shed for them for the remission of sinnes but they are clensed by the remission of no sinne they are wonderfull strange and vntrue things which you affirme concil valent anno cap concerning the redemption of christs blood by reason of the exceeding errors which haue growne in respect thereof in so much that some euen as their owne writings doe witnesse doe hold that it was shed euen for those vngodly ones who from the beginning of the world vntill the passion of our lord were dead in their vngodlinesse and punished with eternall damnation contrarie to that saying of the prophet o death i will be thy death and thy sting o hell we do decree that it ought simply and faithfully to be held and taught according to the euangelicall and apostolicall truth that we iudge that this ransome was giuen for them of whom the lord himselfe saith euen as moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lifted vp that euery one which beleeueth in him may not perish but haue eternall life so god loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten son that euery one that beleeued in him might not perish but haue euerlasting life and the apostle saith christ was once offered for the taking away of the sinnes of many prosper ascribes this platforme of generall grace vnto the pelagians this is saith he their very opinion and profession that adam sinning euery man sinned and that no man is saued by his owne workes but by the grace of god in regeneration and yet that the reconcilement which is in the sacrament of christs blood is without exception offered vnto all man so that whosoeuer will come vnto faith and baptisme may be saued and that god did foreknow before the creation of the world who should beleeue or who should remaine in that faith which must afterward be propped and helped by his grace and that hee predestinated them vnto his kingdome who being freely called he foresaw that they would be worthie of election and that they would depart out of this life making a good end and that therefore euery man is prouoked to beleeue and doe good by godly institutions that no man may despaire of the attainement of eternall life seeing that there is a reward prepared for a voluntarie deuotion the difference i confesse consists in this that the pelagians doe either wholly ascribe vnto nature the abilitie to do well or else partly to nature and partly to grace but this platforme ascribeth all things wholly vnto grace which indeede is very right but whilest they goe about to ordaine vniuersall grace they doe not free themselues but are rather more entangled for most true is that saying of peter martyr whilest these man make grace so common to all they turne grace into nature and i would willingly be certified whether they who haue receiued this grace be regenerate or no if they be regenerate then all man are regenerate if they bee not regenerate then haue all man power to beleeue and to attaine saluation if they will yes euen whilest they remaine vnregenerate but this power if it bee in man before his conuersion will not differ much from nature and if so be that grace extend as farre as nature wee must not pray more for grace than for nature neither neede wee any more pray for the conuersion of vnbeleeuers because it is in their owne power by reason of generall grace to be conuerted if they will prosper also ascribeth this platforme to the pelagians in these verses but afterwards he condemneth it in this sort and againe he saith and againe hee answereth the pelagians who say that by willing it wee are able to attaine god grace or else to resist it by nilling it after this manner and againe and againe faustus the semipelagian accused the catholiques in that they said that our lord iesus christ did not take vpon him mans flesh for all man nor died generally for all and on the other side the catholiques accuse the pelagians in that they say that god repelleth none from eternall life but is willing prosper ep d august indifferently that all man should be saued and to come vnto the knowledge of the truth and againe that they say that our lord iesus christ died for all mankind and that no man is vtterly exempted from the redemption of his blood although he leade all this his life estranged from him because that the sacrament of god grace appertaineth vnto all man whereby many are not therefore regenerated because they are foreknowne that they haue not a will to be regenerated and that therefore on god part eternall life is prepared for all man but in respect of the freedome of the will they say that they onely attaine euerlasting life who doe of their owne accord beleeue and againe they say that they will not admit of that exposition of that saying which is alledged out of augustine which is that vnlesse bee will haue all man to be saued and againe not onely those which appertaine vnto the number of the faints but all man altogether without exception of any i wish also that thing were marked namely that the catholiques are accused by the pelagians that vnder the name of predestination they did establish a certeine fatall necessitie and that they made a kind of violent preordination which accusation hath also been laid against vs and the like crime sheweth the like cause lastly this platforme doth passing wel agree with that doctrine concerning predestination which is generally maintained in the schooles and synagogues of the papists yes verily to speake the truth it seemeth to bee borrowed euen from thence for if we well consider of the matter what else hath pighius taught what else hath cartharinus maintained and else at this day doe the grosse fat monckes maintaine who imparke god actions in the case of predestination within these pales first say they god foresaw the natures and sinnes of all man then prepared he christ the redeemer afterward he willed for the merit of christ foreseene to bestow sufficient helpes of grace vpon all man whereby they might bee saued through christ and hee would it euen in this so much as in him was that all man might bee saued his will preceding lasily he did mercifullie predestinate those whom he did see would end their liues in god fauour and hee did iustly reiect othersome either for originall or actuall sins in which he foresaw they would end their liues this is euident by scriptures and experience isai that which hath not bin told them shall they see and that which they haue not heard they shall vnderstand isai behold thou shalt call a nation which thou hast not knowne and nation that knew not thee shall run vnto thee isai i haue bin sought of them that asked not before i was found of them that sought me not osec and in the place where it was said vnto them ye are not my people osec i will haue mercy vpon her that was not pitied and i will say to them which were not my people thou article my people act god in times past suffered all the gentiles to walke in their owne waies act and the time of this ignorace god regarded not but now he admonisheth all man euer e where to repent rom to him now that is of power to establish you according to my gospell and preaching of iesus christ by the reuelation of the mysterie which was kept secret since the world began but now is opened colos which is the mystery hid since the world began and from all ages but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make knowne what is the riches of this glorious mysterie among the gentiles ephesians yee were at that time without christ and had no hope and were atheists or without god in the world ephesian the mysterie of christ in other ages was not opened vnto the sonnes of man as it is now reuealed vnto his holy apostles psalm he sheweth his word vnto iacob his statutes and his iudgements vnto israel hee hath not dealt so with euery nation neither haue they knowne his iudgements the most wise philosophers among the gentils haue indeed smattered many things of god but in the meane time what say they of christ why should they bee so exceeding silent in this point if christ were reuealed vnto all socrates being readie to die said i depart out of this life and they doe liue with whom i am thoroughly to pleade my cause whether it bee good the immortall god doe know and indeed i thinke no man knoweth and we owe saith he o crito a co ke to aesculapius to pay the price of the potion it is reported that aristotle being readie to die cried out o thou which article the chiefest thing of all things which are haue mercie vpon me the gentils knew not god that great benefactour and therefore fained vnto themselues certaine sauiours castor and pollux and hercules called that is a helper in distresse or repeller of euils and aesculapius the physitian solinus saith that there is not as yet any of the gentiles found who hath attained vnto the height of felicitie and may iustly be accounted happy albinus speaketh thus when such like questions are propounded why one is iudged thus and another after another manner why this man is blinded god giuing him ouer and another enlightned through god assistance let not vs presume or take vpon vs to iudge of the iudgement of so great a iudge but with trembling let vs crie out with the apostle o the depth the promise concerning the seede of the woman belongs not to all and to euery one for a promise to whom it is not reuealed is not actually a promise howsoeuer the redemption that is by christ belongeth vnto all yet it belongs not to all and to euerie one for a benefit to be perceiued or receiued by a supernaturall faith if it bee not reuealed is no benefit vocation and vniuersall sauing grace belongs not to all and euery particular person for god calleth vs by reuealing and offring christ to vs the foreknowledge of faith in christ and of contempt of the gospell priuatiue infidelitie is not the square and rule according to which god hath ordained and disposed his predestination because there be very manie that neuer so much as heard of christ in whom therefore there is neither faith in christ nor priuatiue infidelitie or contempt of the gospell trini vni deo

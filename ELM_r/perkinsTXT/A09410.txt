the occasion and so also the coherence of these wordes with the former is this the evangelist matthew setting downe the sermons and sayings of our sauiour christ keeps not this course to propounde euery thing as it was done or spoken but sometime he settes down that first which was done last and that last which was done before according as the spirit of god directed him which thing is verified in these wordes where the praier is mentioned yet the occasion wherfore our sauiour christ taught his disciples to pray is not here specified but in saint luke verse the occasion of these wordes is euident for there it is said that the disciples of our sauior knowing that john taught his disciples to pray made request to their master that he would do the same to them likewise these few words set before the praier are a commandement and it prescribes vnto vs two duties the first to praie the second to pray after the manner following touching the first point considering verie fewe among the people know how to pray aright we must learne what it is to pray to make praier is to put vp request to god acording to his word from a contrite hart in the name of christ with assurance to bee hard for the better opening of these words we are to consider six questions the first is to whome wee are to pray the answer is to god alone rom howe shal they cal on him in whome they haue not beleeued ampc marke how inuocation and faith are linked together and paules reson may be framed thus in whome we put our affiance or beleif to him alone must we pray but we beleue only in god therefore wee must onely praie to him as for saints or angels they are in no wise to be called vpon because not the least title of god worde prescribes vs so to doe because they cannot heare our praiers and discerne what are the thoughts and desires of our harts and because invocation is a parte of diuine worship and therefore peculiar to god alone the second question is what kinde of action prayer is answer it is no lip labour it is the putting vp of a sute vnto god and this action is peculiar to the verie hart of a man rom the spirite makes request for vs but how with grones in the hart exod the lord said to moses why criest thou yet there is no mentio made that moses spake any word at all the lorde no doubt accepted the inward mourning and desire of his hart for a crie the third question is what is the forme or rule according vnto which we are to pray answer it is the reueiled wil and word of god a man in humbling his soule before god is not to pray as his affections carrie him and for what he list but all is to be done according to the expresse worde so as those things which god hath comanded vs to ask wee are to aske and those thinges which hee hath not commanded vs to ask we are in no wise to pray for john this is the assurance vvhich vvee haue of him that if wee aske any thing according to his will hee heareth vs this then is a speciall clause to be marked that man must praye in knowledge not in ignorance here weigh the case of poore ignorant people they talke muche of praying for themselues amp others they imagine that they pray verie deuoutlie to god but alas they doe nothing les because they knowe not what to ask acording to god will they therefore must learne god worde and pray according to the same else it will prooue in the end that all their praying was nothing but as mocking and flat dishonoring of god the fourth question is with what affection a man must pray answer prayer must proceed from a broken and contrite hart this is the sacrifice which god accepteth psalm verse when ahab abased himselfe though he did it in hypocrisie yet god had some respect vnto it king verse saith the lorde to eliah seest thou how ahab is humbled before me this contrition of heart stands in two thinges the first of them is a liuely feeling of our own sinne miserie and wretched estate howe that we are compassed about with inumerable enemy euen with the deuill and all his angels amp within a bound even with huge seas of wants and rebellious corruptios whereby we most grieuouslie displease god amp are vile in our own eies being therefore thus beset on euerie side wee are to be touched with the sense of this our gret miserie and he that wil pray aright must putte on the person and the verie affection of a poore wretched begger and certainely not being grieued with the rufull condition in which we are in our selues it is not possible for vs to pray effectually psalm verse out of the deepes i called vpon thee o lord that is when i was in my greatest miserie and as it were not far fro the gulfes of hell then i cried to god isai lord in trouble haue they visited thee they powred out a prayer when thy chastening was vpon them sam i am a woman saith anna of an hard spirite that is a troubled soule and haue powred out my soul before the lord hence it appeareth that the ordinary praiers of most me greuously displease god seing they ar made for fashion only without any sense and feeling of their miseries commonly man come with the pharisie in ostentation of their integritie and they take greate paines with their lips but their harts wader from the lorde the second thing required in a contrite hart is a longing desire and hungring after god graces and benefites whereof we stand in need it is not sufficient for a man to buckle as it were and to go crooked vnder his sinnes and miseries but also hee must haue a desire to be eased of them amp to be enriched with graces needefull thus hezekias the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amos praied against senacharib and cried vnto heauen chronicle where wee may see what a maruelous desire they had to obtaine their request so also rom the spirite maketh request with grones so greate that they cannot be vttered as they are felte dauid psalm saith that hee desireth after the lorde as the thirstie land now we know that the groud partched with heat opens it selfe in rifts and cranies and gapes towards heauen as though it would deuoure the cloudes for want of moisture and thus must the hart bee disposed to god grace till it obtaine it the people of israel being in grieuous affliction how do they pray they powre out their soul like vvater before the face of the lord lam verse the fift question is in whose name praier must be made answer it must not be made in the name of any creature but onely in the name and mediatio of christ ioh ver if yee ask any thing in my name i will do it a man is not to present his prayers to god in any worthines of his own merites for what is hee to make the best of himself what can he make of himselfe by nature he is no better the the verie firebrand of hell and of all god creatures the most outragious rebell to god and therefore cannot be heard for his own sake as for saints they can be no mediators seing euen they themselues in heauen are accepted of god not for themselues but only for the blessed merites of christ if any man sinne saith s john epistle chap verse wee haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ but how proues he this it followes then and hee is the reconciliation for our sinnes his reason stands thus he which must bee an aduocate must firste of all be a reconciliation for vs no saintes can be a reconciliation for vs therefore no saints can be aduocates therfore in this place is manifest an other faulte of ignoraunt people they cry often lord help me lorde haue mercy vpon me but in whose name pray they poore soules like blinde bayardes they rush vpon the lord they know no mediatour in whose name they should present their praiers vnto him little do they consider with themselues that god is as well a most terrible iudge as a mercifull father the sixt question is whether saith be requisit to prayer or not answere praier is to be made with faith whereby a man may haue a certaine assurance to be heard for he that praieth must stedfastly beleeue that god in christ will grat his petition this affiance being wanting it maketh praier to bee no praier for how can be pray for any thing effectually who doubteth whether he shall obtaine it or noe wherefore it is an especiall pointe of prayer to be perswaded that god to whome praier is made not onely can but also will graunt his request marke whatsoeuer yee desire vvhen yee praye beleeue that yee shall haue it and it shall bee doone vnto you here we see two thinges required in praier the first a desire of the good thinges which we want the second is faith wherby we beleue that god will grant the thinges desired the ground of this faith is reconciliation with god amp the assurance thereof for vnlesse a man be in conscience in some mesure perswaded that al his sinnes are pardoned and that hee stands reconciled to god in christ hee cannot beleeue any other promises reuealed in the word nor that any of his praiers shall be heard thus much of the definition of praier now let vs see what vse may be made of this commandement pray yee thus seeing our sauiour commandeth his disciples and so euen vs also to praie to god it is our dutie not only to present our praiers to god but also to doe it cheerefully and earnestlie rom also brother i besech you that yee woulde striue with me by praiers to god for me what is the cause why the lord doeth oft defer his blessings after our praiers no cause but that hee might stirre vs vp to be more feruent amp more earnestly to crye vnto the lord exod when moses praieth to god in the behalfe of the israelites the lord answers let me alone as though his praiers did bind the lord and hinder him fro executing his iudgments wherefore this is good aduise for all christian man to continue and to be zealous in praier if thou be an ignorant man for shame learne to praie seeing it is god commandement make conscience of it we see that there is no man vnlesse he be desperatly wicked but wil mak some conscience of killing amp stealing and why is this because it is god commandment thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steale well then this also is god commandement to pray let this consideration breed in thee a conscience of this dutie and although thy corrupt nature shall drawe thee away from it yet striue to the contrary and know it certainely that the breach of this command maketh thee as well guiltie of damnation before god as any other furthermore this must be a motiue to prick thee forward to this dutie that as god commandes vs to pray so also he giues the spirite of praier whereby the commaundement is made easie vnto vs if the lord had commanded a thing impossible then there had bene some cause of discouragemet but commanding a thing through the grace of his spirite verie easie and profitable howe much more are we bound to the obedience of the same againe praier is the key whereby wee open the treasures of god and pull downe his mercies vpon vs for as the preaching of the word serues to declare and to conuey vnto vs god graces so in praier we come to haue a liue lie feeling of the same in our harts and further this must moue vs to praier seeing in praier we haue familiaritie with god maiestie it is an high fauour for a man to bee familiar with a prince howe much more then to be familiar with the king of kings the mightie iehouah this then can bee no burthen or trouble vnto vs being one of the many prerogatiues that god bestowes on his church for in the preaching of the worde it pleaseth god to talke to vs and in praier god doth vouchsafe vs this honour to speake and as it were familiarly to talk with him not as to a fearful iudge but as to a louing and mercifull god consider also that praier is a worthie means of defence not onely to vs but also to the church and them that are absent by it moses stood in the breache which god wrath had made into the pepill of israell and staied the same psalm ver by this christian man fight as valiant champions against their own corruptions and all other spirituall enemy ephesian verse infinite were it to shewe howe many blessings the lord hath bestowed on his seruaunts by prayer in a worde luther whome it pleased god to vse as a worthie instrumet for the restoring of the gospell testifieth of himselfe that hauing this grace giuen him to call vpon the name of the lord he had more reuealed vnto him of god trueth by praier then by reding amp study the second point of the comandement is to pray after the maner following in the lordes prayer where it is to bee noted that the lord prayer is a direction and as it were a sampler to teach vs how and in what maner wee ought to praie none is to imagine that we are bound to vse these words only and none other for the meaning of christ is not to binde vs to the words but to the matter and maner and to the like affections in praying if this were not so the praiers of god servant set down in the bookes of the old and newe testament should be al faultie because they ar not according to the wordes of the lord praier also by reason of this diverse in our church ignorantly perswade them selues that it is unlawful to vse the wordes as they are set downe for a praier first say they it is scripture and therefore not to be vsed as a prayer i answer that the same thing may be the scripture of god and also the praier of man else the praiers of moses dauid and paul being set downe in the scriptures cease to be praiers againe they say that in praier we are to expres our wantes in particular and the graces which wee desire nowe in these wordes all things to be praied for are onely in generall propounded i answer that the maine wants that are in any man and the principall graces of god to be destred are set downe in the petitions of this praier in particular thirdly they pleade that the pattern to make al praiers by should not be vsed as a praier i answere that therefore the rather it may be vsed a a praier and sure it is th ancient and worthie diuines haue reuereced it as a praier chosing rather to vse these words then any other as cyprianus sermone de orat dominic and tertullian lib de fuga in persequutione and augustine sermone de tepore wherfore the opinion is ful of ignorace amp error well whereas our sauiour first giues a commaundement to pray and then after giueth a direction for the keeping of it this he doeth to stiree vp our dulnes and to allure vs by all meanes to this heauenly exercise of praier wherfore still i say imploy your selues in praier feruently and continually and if you cannot do it learne to praye thus much of the commandement of our sauior christ nowe followe the wordes of the praier these wordes containe three parts a preface the praier it self containing six petitions the testification of faith in the last worde amen which although it be short yet it doth not containe the smallest point in the praier it is i say a testification of our faith whereas the petitions that go before are only testifications of our desires nowe of these three parts in order we must consider how our sauiour christ doth not set downe the petitions abruptly but he first beginnes with a solemne preface whereby we are taught this lesso that he which is to pray vnto god is first to prepare himselfe and not boldly without consideration as it were to rushe into the presence of god if a ma be to come before an earthly prince hee will order himselfe in apparel gesture and words that he may do all thinges in seemelines amp dutiful reuerence how much more are man to order themselues when they are to appear before the liuing god eccle be not rash with thy mouth amp let not thine hart be hastie to vtter a thing before the lord and dauid psalm washed his hands in innocencie before he came to the altar of the lord to offer sacrifice the meanes whereby man may stir vp their dul and heauie hea and so prepare themselues to praier are three the first is to read diligently the word of god concerning those matters about which they are to pray and what then this will be a meanes not onely to direct him but also to quicken the heart more feruently to deliuer his praier this is euident by a coparison the beames of the sun descending heat not before they come to the earth or some solide body where they may reflect and then by that means the earth and aire adjoyning is made very hote euen so the lord sends downe vnto vs his blessed worde euen as beames and the goodly sunshine amp thereby he speaks to our harts now when we make our praiers of that which we haue reade god worde is as it were reflected and our heartes are thereby warned with the cofortable heat of god holy spirit to powre out our praiers to god more feruently the second meanes is to pray to god that hee would strengthen vs with his spirit that we might be able to pray as it is practised psalme the third meanes is the consideration of god most glorious maiestie wherin we are to remember first his fatherly goodnes and kindenes whereby he is willing amp secondly his omnipotencie where by he is able to grant our requests one of these emboldned the lepar to pray lord if thou wilt thou canst make me cleane mat therfore both together are more effectuall nowe let vs come to the preface it selfe our father vvhich article in heuen it contains a descriptio of the true iehoua to whom we pray and that by two arguments the first is drawen from a relation our father the second is taken fro the subiect or place which article in heuen in the opening of this word or title of god two questions are to be opened quest whether by this title father is signified the whol trinitie or some one person thereof ans otherwhiles this name is attributed to all the persons in trinitie or any of them malac haue we not all one father ampc luke which was the son of adam which was the son of god and in isai christ is called the father of eternitie because al that ar truly knit to him and born a new by him they are eternally made the son of god again oftentimes it is giuen to the first perso in trinitie as in those places where one person is conferred with another and so in this place principally for some speciall respects this title agrees to the first person for first he is the father of christ as he is the eternall worde of the father and that by nature because hee is of the same essence with him secondly he is father to christ in respect of his manhood not by nature or adoption but by personall vnion because the humane nature doeth subsist in the person of the word thirdly hee is a father to all the faithfull by adoption in christ question whether we are to pray to the son and holy ghost as to the father ans inuocation belonges to all the three persons in trinitie and not only to the father act steuen praieth lord iesus receiue my spirit thes now god our father and our lord iesus christ guide our iourney vnto you corinthian the grace of our lord iesus christ the loue of god amp the communion of the holy ghost be vvith you some say this praier is a perfect platforme of all praiers and in it wee are taught to direct our praiers to the father not to the son or holy spirit i answer the father son and holy ghost are three distinct persons yet they are not to be seuered or diuided because they al subsist in one and the same godhead or diuine nature and further in all outward actions as in the creation and preseruation of the world and the saluation of the elect they are not seuered or deuided for they al work together onely they are distinguished in the maner of working now if they be not deuided in nature or operation then they are not to be seuered in worship and in this place we direct our praiers to the father because he is the first in order yet so as then we imploy the son and holy ghost for we pray to the father in the name of the son by the assistance of the holy ghost and to what persone soeuer the praier is directed we must alwaies remember in minde and heart to include the rest the vses of this point are manifolde first whereas we are taught to com to god as to a father and therefore in the name of his son our sauiour christ wee learne to lay the first ground of all our praiers in the holding amp maintaining of the vnion and distinction of the three persons in trinitie this being the lowest and the first foundation of praier it is requisite that al which woulde pray aright should haue this knowledge rightly to beleeue of the trinitie amp to know how the three persons agree and how they are distinguished amp the order of them how the father is the first the son the second the holy ghost the third and therefore how the father is to be called vpon in the name of the son by the holy ghost hence it is manifest that ignorant and sillie people which do not so much as dreame of the vnion distinction and order of the persons in trinitie mak but cold and slender kind of praying secondly we may learn hereby that we are not in any wise to inuocate saintes and angels but onely the true iehoua the reason stands thus this praier is either a perfect platform for all praiers or not to say it were not were an injurie to our sauiour christ to say it is so is also to grant that it doth fully set downe to whome al praiers are to be made papistes that are the great patrons of invocation of saints in their reformed breuiaries and missales deal very fodly for first they pray to mary that she would pray to christ for them and when they haue so done like iuglers they come to christ and pray vnto him that hee would accept maries praier for them thirdly we learne that there can be no intercessour betweene god and vs but onely christ for here we ar taught to come to god not as to a iudge but as to a kind and louing father now he is a father to vs onely by christ as for angels and saints amp al creatures they are not able to procure by any meanes that god shoulde become a father no not so much as to one man againe if the god to whom we pray be a father we must learn to acquaint our selues with the promises which hee hath made in his word to quicken our hearts in praier vnto him for this word father implies redines and willingnes in god to heare and be mercifull to our praiers and a father cannot but must needs mak some promises of fauour to those that be his children and therefore it cannot be that he should call god truly his father which hath not in his heart this assurance that god will fulfill his promises vnto him promises made to praier these and such like are to bee marked as follow chronicle if my people among vvhome my name is called vpon do humble themselues and pray amp seek my presence and turne from their wicked waies then i will heave in heuen amp be mercifull to their sinnes chronicle the lord is with you while you be with him and if ye seeke him he will be found of you isai before they call i wil answere and whiles they speak i vvill heare mat aske and it shall be giuen you seeke and ye shal find knock and it shall be opened luke if ye vvhich are evil can giue good gifts vnto your children how much more shal your heauenly father giue the holy ghost to them that desire him rom hee that is lord ouer all is rich vnto all that call on him iam drawe neere vnto god and he will draw neere vnto you if god be a father who is called vpon then praier is the note of god child s luke and s paul set out the faithfull servant of god by this note act he hath authoritie to binde al that cal on thy name corinthian to them that are sanctified by iesus christ saints by calling with all that call on the name of our lorde iesus christ and contrariwise psalm it is made one of the properties of an atheist neuer to cal on the name of god and such persons as neither wil nor can or vse not hartely to pray to god they may say that they are perswaded there is a god but in their doings they bear themselues as if there wer no god he which would pray aright must be like the prodigall childe that is he must not onely confesse his sin saying father i haue sinned against heauen and against thee ampc but also haue a ful purpose neuer after to offend his father for how can a childe call him father whome hee cares not continually to displease through his lewd conditions he cannot do it neither can any father delight in suche a child therefore in praier we must call to minde our lewdnes and rebellions against our heauenly father and with the publican in heuines of soule say lord be mercifull to me a sinner he which can truly do this is a kind child if we consider our selues as we are by nature wee are the children of the deuill noe childe so like his father as wee are like him and in this estate we continually rebel against god for the deuill hath al the heart our whol joy is to serue and please him a man that is to pray must think on this and be heauy for it and happy yes a thousand times happy ar they who haue grace giuen them to see this their state amp to bewaile it and further it is not sufficient to confesse our sinnes against our mercifull father but wee must set downe with our selues neuer in such sort to offend him againe and to leade a newe life this point is very profitable for these times for many there be when any crosse or sicknes comes on them they will pray and promise repentance and all obedience to god worde if it shall please god to deliuer them but this vsually is but in hypocrisie they dissemble with god and man for when their sicknes is past like a dogge that hath bene in the water they shake their eares and runne streight with all greedinesse to their former sinnes is this to call god father no hee that doth this shall not haue god to be his father but the man that is wounded in his soul for his offeces past and carrieth a purpose in his heart neuer wittingly and willingly to offend god againe lastly here we ar to obserue that he which would pray must be indued with the spirit of adoptio the workes whereof in the matter of praier are twofold the first to moue him to crie and call on god as a father it is no easie thing to pray for to a man of himselfe it is as easie to mooue the whole earth with his hand how then comes it that we pray it is a blessed worke of the spirit rom wee haue receiued the spirit of adoption whereby vve crie abba that is father and rom likewise the spirit helpeth our infirmities for wee knowe not what to pray as we ought but the spirit it self maketh request and zach the holy ghost is called the spirit of grace and deprecations or praiers wel then the man that woulde pray must haue god spirite to bee his schoolmaster to teach him to pray with grones and sighes of the hart for the wordes make not the praier but the grones amp desires of the hart and a man praies for no more then he desires with his heart and hee which desires nothing praies not at all but spends liplabor the second work of the spirit is to assure vs in our consciences that we are in the state of grace reconciled to god rom the spirit of adoption beareth witnes with our spirits that we are the children of god and this inward certificate of the spirit in all exercises of invocation is very necessarie for hee which wants this assurance if hee be secure and benummed in his sinnes will not and if he be touched in conscience for them for his life hee dare not cal god father also this confutes the opinio of the church of rome which teacheth that a man must doubt whether hee be adopted or no for howe can a man trulie cal god father when he doubts whether he be the child of god or no it is a miserable kinde of praying to call god father and to doubt whether he be a father indeede it is true that doubts will often rise but it is our dutie to striue against them and not to yeeld vnto them yes but say they to be certain of god mercy is presumption i answere if it be presumption it is an holy presumption because god hath bidden vs call him father thus much of the argument of relation now let vs proceede it is further said our father quest whether may it bee lawful for vs in praier to say not our father but my father ans a christian may in priuate praier say my father this is warranted by the example of our sauiour mat o my father if it be possible let this cup passe from me and mat my god my god whie hast thou forsaken mee the meaning of christe is not to binde vs to these wordes but to teache vs that in our praiers wee must not haue regard to our selues onely but also to our brother amp therefore when we pray for them in our priuate praiers as for our selues wee put in practise the true meaning of these wordes vvhen we pray we must not make request onlie for our selues amp our own good but for others also as the church and people of god perswading our selues that we also are partakers of their praiers and for the better clearing of this point let vs search who they are for whome we are to pray of man there be two sortes some liuing some dead of these two kindes the liuing are to be praied for and there is no praying for the dead a man that is dead knowes what shall be his estate eternally if he died a wicked person his state shall be according in eternall torments if hee died godly then he shall rest with god in his kingdom apocrypha blessed are they vvhich die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their vvorkes follow them gal while vve haue time let vs do good to al man where we may note that there is a time namelie after death when we cannot againe of the liuing some are our enemy and some our frends our frends are they which are of the same religion affection disposition foes are either priuate or publike publike foes are either enemy to our country as tyrants traitors ampc or enemy to our religion as iewes turks papists infidel atheists nowe towards all these how ought a man to behaue himselfe in prayer ans hee is to pray for them all mat praie for them vvhich hurt you and persecute you tim i exhort that praiers intercessions ampc be made for all man for kinges ampc yet when paul gaue this commandement we read not that there wer any christia kings but all infidel and the iewes are commanded to pray for babylon where they were captiue ieremie and seeke the prosperitie of the cittie whither i haue caused you to bee carried captiue and praie vnto the lord for it quest howe and in what maner are we to pray for our enemy ans we are to pray against their sinnes counsels enterprise but not against their persons thus praied dauid against achitophell sa lord i praie thee bring the counsell of achitophell to foolishnes and thus did the apostles pray against their persecuters act o lord behold their threatnings and graunt vnto thy servant with all boldnes to sp ake thy word question dauid vseth imprecations against his enemy in which he praieth for their vtter confusion as psalm amp ampc the like is done by paul gal tim and peter act though afterwards hee mitigates his exexcration but how could they do it ans they were indued with an extraordinarie measure of god spirit and hereby they were enabled to discerne of the estate of their enemy amp certainly to judge that their wickednes and malice was incurable and that they shuld neuer repent and the like praiers did the primatiue church coceiue against iulia the apostata because they perceiued him to be a malicious and desperate enemie secondly they were indued with a pure zeal against their enemy intending nothing else but the glory of god now for vs it is good that we should suspect our zeal because sinister affections as hatred envy emulation desire of reuenge wil mingle themselues with our zeal question how far forth may we vse those psalmes in which dauid vseth imprecations against his enemy ans they are to be read and song with these caueats wee are to vse those imprecations indefinitely against the enemy of god and his church for wee may perswade our selues that alwaies there be some such obstinate enemy but we must not apply them particularly secondly wee must vse them as augustine saith as certaine prophetical sentences of the holy ghost pronouncing the last sentence of destruction of final amp impenitent sinners which oppose themselues against god kingdom thirdly they may be vsed against our spiritual enemy the flesh the devil and his angels amp the world furthermore whereas we ar taught to say our father this serues to put vs in minde that in praying to god we must bring loue to me with vs we must all be as the children of one father louingly disposed one to another for how shuld he call god his father who wil not take the child of god for his brother mat when thou article to offer thie gifte vnto god if thou haue ought against thie brother first be reconciled and then come and offer thy gift so also esay the lorde saith that when they pray vnto him hee will not heare why because their hands were ful of blud in these times many man can be contet formally to praie but yet they will not leaue bribing oppression deceit vsurie ampc the common song of the worlde is euerie man for himselfe and god for vs all this is the common loue and care that man haue eche to other the praiers of such are abhominable euen as the sacrifice of a dog as esay saith for howe can they call god their father that haue no loue to their brother thirdly hence we may learn that god is no accepter of persos for this praier is giuen to all man of what state or degree soeuer all then aswell poore as rich vnlearned as learned subjectes as rulers may say our father it is not with the lord as it is with the worlde but all are his children that doe beleeue the poore man hath as good interest in god kingdome and may call god father as well as the king qvestion howe may god bee said to be in heuen seeing he is infinite and therefore must needes be euery where king the heauens of heauens are not able to containe him answer god is saide to be in heauen because his majestie that is his power wisedome justice mercy is made manifest from thence vnto vs psalme our god is in heauen and doth vvhatsoeuer he will psalm he that dwelleth in heauen shall laugh them to scorne and the lord shall haue them in derision esay saith thus saith the lord heauen is my throne and the earth is my footstoole after this life hee wil manifest the fulnes of his glorie there to his angels and saints heereby first we learn that roman pilgrimages wherby man went from place to place to worship god are vain and foolish the god to whome wee must pray is in heauen nowe let man trauell to what place or countrey they will they shall not come the neerer to heauen or neerer to god by traueling seeing the earth is in euerie part alike distat from heuen secondly this ouerthrowes popish idolatry as woorshipping of crosses crucifixes roods ampc to put vs in mind of god amp christ wee are taught to lift vp our eies to heuen seeing god is there and how can we do this as long as our mindes and eies are poring vpon an image made by mans arte againe wee are here admonished to vse the action of praier with as great reuerence as possible may be wel reasons salomon eccle be not rash with thy mouth to speak a vvord before god why he is in heaven thou article in earth therfore let thy vvords be few this reuerence must appeare in holines of minde and affection and in al comlines of gesture and for this cause al wandering bythoughts and all vaine babling is to be auoided but how goes the case with vs that on the times appointed come to the asseblies to pray many by reason of their blindenes pray without vnderstanding many when they are present at praier yet haue their hearts occupied about other matters about their goods and worldly busines such man haue no joye or gladnes in praying it is a burde to them many come to the assemblie for custom only or for fear of punishment if they might be left free they could find in their harts not to pray at all but let all suche me know that this maner of praiing is a very greenous sinne nay greater then mocking of father or mother killing or stealing for it is directly against god the other against man this sin because it is against the first table and therfore more hard to bee discerned it is lightly esteemed and it lesse troubles the consciences of ignorant man yet as it is indeede so it is to be esteemed as a disgrace amp plaine mockerie of god majestie wherfore seeing god is in heuen away with al drowsie and dead praying let vs come with reuerence in our hearts before the lord againe wee are here to consider that our harts in praier must mount vp into heauen and there be present with the lord psalm vnto thee o lord lift i vp my soule the litle childe is neuer well but when it is in the fathers lap or vnder the fathers wing and the children of god are neuer in better case then when in affection amp spirit they can come into the presece of their heauenly father and by prayer as it were to creep into his bosome lastly this preface sheweth that god is all sufficient as in al other things so in granting our requests god is willing to hear our praiers in that hee is our father amp able to performe them because he is in heuen amp therefore almightie thus much of the preface now follow the petitions they be six in number the three first concerne god and his glorie the other three concern our selues the three former petitions are againe deuided into two partes the firste concernes god glorie it selfe the other two the meanes whereby god glory is manifested and inlarged among man for god his name is glorified among man whe his kingdome doth come and his will is done question why is this petition hallowed be thy name set in the first place answere because god glory must bee preferred before all thinges because it is the end of all creatures and of all the counsels of god prou the lord hath made all thinges for his owne sake yes euen the vvicked for the day of euill and from the order of the petitions heere ariseth a worthy instruction namely that euery one in all thinges they take in hande are to propound to themselues and to intend the glory of god the reason is this the end which god hath appointed to all our doings we are to propound to our selues but god hath appointed that the highest end of all our doings shuld be his glorie therfore our hearts must be set to seeke it first of all that god will haue his name glorified by vs appeareth in this that he punisheth those which of obstinacie set themselues to dishonour him or by negligence did not sanctifie him when they should haue done so herod sitting in his royaltie made such an oration that the people cried the voice of a god and not of a man and immediatly the angel of the lord smote him because he gaue not the glory to god act and moses because he did not sanctifie the lord in the presence of the children of israel therefore he came not into the land of promise yet he did but faile in doing of it thus wee may see by these punishments and also by the order of the petitions that it is our duties to prefer the glory of god before all things else quest whether are we to prefer the glory of god before the saluation of our soules answer if the case stand thus that god name must be dishonoured or our soules condemned we must account the glory of god more pretious than the saluation of our soules this is manifest in the order of the petitions the petition that concernes god glory is first and the petitions that concerne directly our saluation are the fift and sixt where by we are taught that before god should want any part of his glory we are to let soule and all go and let god haue all his glory this affection had moses exod when he said either forgiue them or if thou vvilt not blot my name out of thy booke in this petition as also in the rest we must obserue three things the first is the mening of the words the second the wants which man must learn to bewail the third the graces of god that ar to be desired verie fewe among the people can giue the right meaning of the wordes of this praier they pretend that seeing god knowes their good meaning it is sufficient for them to say the wordes and to meane well but faith being one of the groundes of praier amp there being no faith without knowledg neither can there bee praier without knowledge and therefore ignorant man are to learne the right meaning of the words name in this place signifieth for god is knowne to vs by al these as man are knowne by their names and as all a mans praise amp glorie lies in his name so all the glorie of god is in these to hallowe is to feuer a thing from the common vse to som proper and peculiar end as the temple was hallowed that is set apart to an holy vse and the priests were sanctified that is set apart to the seruice of god and all that beleeue in christ are sanctified that is set apart from sin to serue god in like manner god name is hallowed when it is put apart from al abuses to an holy reuerent and honorable vse whether we think speake or vse it any maner of way question how can a sinful man hallow god name which is pure and holy in it selfe answer we do not here pray that we might make god name holy but that wee might bee meanes to declare and make manifest to the world by the right vsage of it that it is holy and pure and honourable the like phrase is vsed luke wisedome is iustified of her children that is acknowledged amp declared to be just the scope therefore of the first petition is an earnest desire that we might set foorth god glorie whatsoeuer become of vs and it may be expressed thus o lord open our eies that wee may aright knowe thee and acknowledge the gretnes of thy power wisdom justice and mercie which appeares in thy titles worde creatures and judgements and grant that when we vse any of these we may therein glorifie thee and vse them reuerently to thy glory the wants which we in this place are taught to bewail are especiallie foure the first is an inward and spirituall pride of our hearts a sin that none or very few can see in themselues vnlesse the lord open their eies when our first parentes were tempted in paradise the devil told them they should be as god which lesson not onely they but we haue learned and we conceiue of our selues as litle god though to the world we shew it not this hidden pride when other sinnes die it begins to get strength and to shewe it selfe and it appeares in vaine thoughts continuallie on euery occasion ascending in the minde as maye appeare in the pharisie whose thoughts were these whe he praied thus within himselfe o god i thank thee that i am not as other man extortioners vniust adulterers or euen as this publican ampc and as this was in him so it is in vs till god giue grace for so that man may haue praise amp glory in the world they care not for god his glorie though it be defaced wee must therfore learn to discerne this hidden corruption and to mourn for it for it doeth poison amp hinder al good desires of glorifying god so long as it may preuaile in the hart secondly we are taught here to bewaile the hardnesse of our hearts whereby we are hindred from knowing god aright and from discerning the glorie of god in his creatures mark the disciples through the hardnesse of their hartes could not see god power in the miracle of feeding many thousands with a few loues though themselues were instrumentes of it and the food did increase in their hands our redeption what a wonderfull work is it but how few consider of it or regarde it if wee see a man haue more wit wealth or honour than we haue wee straight woonder at him but beholding god creatures we see nothing in them because we do not goe higher to acknowledge the loue power wisedome and iustice of the creator and this is the cause why god name is so slenderly honoured among man the third corruption is our great ingratitude for the lorde hath made heauen and earth and all other creatures to serue m n yet he is the most vnthankful of al creatures bestow manie iewels or a kinges ransome on a dead man he wil neuer returne anie kindnes so man being dead in sinne deale with god commonlie man are like the swine that run with their groines and eat vp the mast but neuer looke vp to the tree from whence it falleth but the godlie are with dauid to feele this want in themselues and to beg god to open and as it were to vnlocke their lippes that they may indeuour to be thankfull to god psalm the fourth is the vngodlines and the innumerable wantes that be in our liues and the sinnes committed in the world psalm mine eies saith dauid gush out with river of water because man keepe not thy lawes the reason is because he which liues in sin reproches god name euen as an euill child dishonors his father now some wil say that this cannot be because our sinnes cannot hurt god a yet they are a cause of slandring god name among man for as we honour him by our good workes so we dishonour him by our offences mat let your light so shine before man that they may see your good workes and glorifie your father which is in heauen the graces to be desired and to be prayed for at god hand are three the first is the knowledge of god that is that we might know him as he hath reueiled himself in his word works and creatures for how shal anie glorifie god before he know him our knowledge in this life is imperfect exo moses may not see god face but his hinder partes corinthian wee may see god as man doe through spectacles in his word sacraments and creatures and therefore as paule prayed for the colossians column that they might increase in the knowledge of god so are wee taught to pray for our selues in this petion a zeale for god glorie psalm the zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp psalm my heart shall vtter or cast vp a good matter i vvill speake in my workes of the king here the spirit of god borrowes a comparison fro man thus as he which hath somewhat lying heauie in his stom cke is neuer at quiet till hee haue cast it vp euen so the care amp desire to glorifie god name must lie vpon a mans heart as an heauie burthen and he is not to bee at ease and quiet with himself till he be disburdened in sounding forth god praise luther saith wel that this is sancta crapula that is an holy surfet and it is no hurt continuallie to haue our harts ouercharged thus a desire to lead a godlie and syncere life as before god majestie we see man that are in some great calling vnder honourable personages wil so order and behaue theselues as they may please and honour their maisters euen so must our liues bee well ordered and we are to labour to walk worthie of the lord as paul speaketh that we may honour our heauenly father this petition dependes on the former most excellentlie for in it is laid downe the meanes to procure the first god name must be hallowed among man but how is it done by the erecting of god kingdome in the heartes of man we cannot glorifie god vntill he rule in our hearts by his word and spirite thy this word doth put vs in mind that there is two kingdoms one god amp that is the kingdome of heauen the other the devil called the kingdom of darknesse column for when all had sinned in adam god laid this punishmet on all that seeing they could not be content to obey their creator they should be in bondage vnder sathan so that by nature we are all the children of wrath and the deuill holds vp the scepter of his kingdome in the heartes of man this kingdome is spirituall and the pillers of it are ignorance errour impietie and all disobedience to god in which the deuill whollie delights which also are as it were the lawes of his kingdome blind ignorant people can not abide this doctrine that the deuill should rule in their hearts they spit at the naming of him amp say that they defie him with all their heartes but whereas they liue in sinne and practise it as occasion is offered though they can not discerne of themselues yet they make plain proofe that they line in the kingdome of sinne and darknes and are stat vessels of sathan amp shal so continew till christ the strong man come and binde him and cast him out and this is the estate of all the children of adam in themselues wherfore our sauiour in this petition teacheth vs to consider our naturall estate and to pray that he would giue vs his spirit to set vs at libertie in the kingdome of his owne son kingdome god kingdome in scriptures is taken two waies first generallie and so it signifieth that administration by which the lord gouerneth all thinges yes euen the deuilles themselues of which kingdome mention is made in the end of this prayer and in psalm verse the lorde raigneth let the earth reioice againe it is taken more speciallie and then it signifieth the administration of christ the head of the church in which hee frameth man by his worde and spirit to the subjection of the same worde and so it is taken in this petition in a kingdome there are foure things to be noted there must bee a king there must be subiectes there are lawes authoritie in this kingdome christ is the king it is he to whome the father hath giuen all authoritie in heauen and earth in this kingdom al are not subjects but such as ar willing to giue free and frank obedience to god word or at the least though their hearts be not sound make an outward profession of it the lawes of this kingdome is the word of god in the books of the old and new testament therfore it is called the kingdome of heauen mat the gospell of the kingdom mark the rod of his mouth isai the arme of god isai as a king by his lawes bringes his people in order amp keeps them in subiectio so christ by his word and the preaching of it as it were by a mightie arme drawes the elect into his kingdome and fashions them to all holie obedience the power and authoritie is that whereby christ conuerts effectually those which are to be conuerted and glorifies himselfe in the confusion of the rest the kingdom being taken thus specially is also twofold the first is the kingdome of grace of which mention is made rom the kingdome of god stands not in meat amp drink but in righteousnes that is the assurance of our justification before god in the righteousnes of christ peace of conscience which proceeds from this assurance and ioy in the holie ghost which comes from them both in this kingdom all man liue not but onelie those that ar subject to christ obedient to the lawes of his kingdome and ruled by his authoritie amp are continually taught in his word by his spirit but those that refuse to liue according vnto the lawes of this king and choose to liue at their owne libertie are in the kingdom of darknesse sinne and sathan the second is the kingdome of glory in heauen which is the blessed estate of al god people there when god shal be al in al in them and the former kingdom of grace is an entrance and preparation to the kingdome of glorie come god kingdome comes when it is established and confirmed in mens hearts and made manifest to all people the impediments being remoued question this comming implies a stopping but howe should god kingdome be hindered answer kingdom in this place is not take for the power of god whereby hee rules all things for that canot be hindred but for the kingdome of grace which in the vsing of the outward meanes as ministers word and sacraments may be hindered by the deuill the world and mans corruption the wantes which wee in this petition are taught to mourn for are of two sorts some concern our own selues some others that which concernes our owne persons is a bondage and slauerie vnder sinne and satan this bondage indeede is weakened in god servant but none is whollie freed from it in this life paule complaineth that he is sould vnder sinne and cries pitifullie o miserable man that i am who shal deliuer me from this bodie of death question what difference then betweene the godlie and the wicked answer the evil and vngodlie man in the verie middest of his bondage hath a mery hart sinne is no trouble to him nay it is meat and drinke to him but the godly man is otherwise minded for considering the power of the deuill and his craft in manifold fearfull temptations and seeing the prooffes of his rebellious nature euer and anon to start away from god he is grieued and confounded in himself amp his heart bleedes within him that hee doth offend so mercifull a father manie man liue in this world amp that manie yeares and yet neuer feele this bondage vnder satan amp sinne such vndoubtedlie cannot tel what the lord prayer meanes but he that would haue the right vse of this petition must bee acquainted with it and bee touched in his conscience for that the flesh and the deuill beare such sway in him as the poore captiue is alwaies creeping to the prison dore alwaies labouring to get off his bolts amp fetters amp to escape out of prison so must we alwaies crie to the lord for his spirite to free vs out of this bondage and prison of sinne and corruption and everie day come neerer the prison doore looking when our blessed sauiour will vnbind vs of all the fetters of sinne and sathan and fullie erect his kingdome in vs the wantes which concerne others are twofold the former is the wat of the good means which serue for the furthering of the kingdome of christ as preaching sacraments and discipline when we shal see a people without knowledge and without good guides and teachers and when we see one stand vp in the congregation not able to teach here is matter for mourning this petition puts vs in mind to bewaile these wantes our sauiour when hee sawe the iewes as sheepe without a shepherd he had compassion on them and hee wept ouer ierusalem because they knewe not the thinges which belonged to their peace luke therefore when preachers want to hold vp the scepter of god before the people and to hold out the word which is as it were the arme of god to pul man from the bondage of the deuill to the kingdome of christ then it is time to say lorde let thy kingdome come the third want which we are to bewail is that there be so many impediments and hinderances of the kingdome of grace as the deuill and al his angels their instruments the pope the turke and all the rest of the professed wicked of the world which by subtile intisements and tyrannie keep back amp repell the means whereby christ ruled as a king in his churche when the deuill sees one that was sometime of his kingdome but to cast a looke toward the heauenly ierusalem he straightway regeth against him and labours quite to ouerthrow him wherfore in regard of al these impediments wee must pray thy kingdom come in this petition we are taught first that we are to haue a feruent desire and to hunger that god of his mercie would giue vs his spirite to raigne and rule in our hearts and to bow them to all obedience and subjection of his will amp further whereas our hearts haue bene as it were filthie sties and stables of the deuill that hee would renew them and make of them sit temples to entertaine his owne spirite psalm create in me a cleane hearte o god and renew a right spirit in me ampc stablish mee with thy free spirit if we shall consider the conuersation of the wicked and the godly and their corrupt hearts together wee shall see litle difference but in this that the wicked is delighted and glad to sinne but the godlie do wrastle as for life and death with their temptations and do resist the devil and doe desire and crie to heauen to be freed from his bondage howsoeuer their hearts are alwaies rebelling against god forasmuch as the kingdome of grace is erected in god church here vpon earth here in this petition wee are commanded to pray for the church of god amp the parts therof psalm pray for the peace of ierusalem they shal prosper that loue thee isaiah ye which are the lord his remembrancers giue him no rest vntill he set vp hierusalem the praise of the world and that god church may flourish amp be in good estate we are to pray for christian kinges and princes that god wold blesse the and increase the number of them for they are as nursing fathers and nursing mothers to the church and wee especiallie are bound to pray for the queenes moste excellent maiestie as also for the frenche king that they may bee blessed and god kingdome by them aduanced and againe because ministers are the lordes watchmen in the church wee are also here put in mind to seeke their good and to pray that their hearts may be set for the building of god kingdome for the beating down of the kingdome of sin and satan amp for the sauing of the soules of his people and the rather because the deuill laboureth night and day to ouerthrow them in this glorious work and to resist them in their ministerie as appeareth in zach when ioshua the high prieste stood before the angel of the lord satan stood at his right hand namely to resist him therefore also we ar to pray for them that the lorde would keepe them and furnish the with giftes and withal make them faithfull for where vision faileth the people are left naked saith salomon thes brother pray for vs that the vvord of the lord may haue a free passage and be glorified thirdlie wee must pray for all christian schooles of learning howsoeuer some think but basely of them yet they are the ordinarie means to maintaine the ministery and so the church of god a man that hath diverse orchards wil also haue a feminarie full of young plantes to maintaine it schooles they are as feminaries to god his church without which the church falles to decay because they serue to make supplie of ministers thirdly we are to desire that the lord would hasten the second comming of christ as the saintes in heauen pray come lord iesus come quicklie and therefore the godlie are said to loue the comming of christ tim a penitent sinner so abhors his owne corruptions and the yrkesome temptations of sathan that in this respect he desires that christ wold hasten his particular comming to him by death for no other cause but that he might make an end of sinning and displeasing god in the seconde petition we desired that god wold let his kingdom come vz that he would rule in our harts if he then must raign we must be his subjects and therfore here we craue that being his subjects we may obey him and do his will mal if i be a father where is mine honour if i be a maister where is my feare vvil will here signifies god worde written in the old and new testament for in his worde his wil is reuealed of the whol wil of god ther be three speciall pointes which are in this place meant to beleeue in christ john this is the wil of him that sent me that euerie one that seeth the son and beleeueth in him should haue life euerlasting sanctification of bodie and soule thes this is the will of god euen your sanctification ampc the bearing of affliction in this life rom those which he knew before he did predestinat to be made like to the image of his owne son philipp that i might know him amp the vertue of his resurrection and the fellowship of his afflictions and be made conformable to his death thy will not mine for mans owne will is wicked and corrupt yes it is flat enmitie to god rom done that is obeyed and accomplished of man then the effect of the prayer is this as wee wold haue thee our king so lord teach vs to obey thy holie will here first we are to bewayle this that our hearts are so prone to vngodlines and disobedience to god commandements put a match to an heape of gunpowder on a sudden it will be all on a flame and as long as we adde matter to the fire it burnes so by nature we are most ready to sin so soone as the least occasion is giuen dauid had experience of this when he prayed knit my heart to thee o lord ampc psalm and incline mine heart to thy comandements psalm those which find not this want in themselues and the like affection to bewaile it are in a miserable and dangerous case euen as a man that hath a great disease vpon him amp knowes not of it againe we must here bewaile the sinnes of the world as ignorance heresies schismes hypocrisie pride ambition contempt of god worde couetousnes oppression want of loue of god and his word ampc pet lot was vexed and his righteous heart vvas grieued vvith the vncleane conuersation of the sodomits from day to day so ought our soules to bee vexed and grieued continuallie at the wickednes of our time and further in this griefe we are to send vp our prayers to god for them that they may be brought to the obedience of god will ezech in a common judgement vpon ierusalem they are marked in the forehead that mourne and crie for all the abhominations that be done in the middest of it here also wee must humble our selues for our vnquietnesse of mind amp greate impatience when god layes anie crosse vpon vs it is god will that we should suffer affliction our sauiour prayed that the cup might be taken away but with submission to his fathers wil luke and this dauid had learned when he said but if he thus say beholde i haue no delight in thee behold here i am let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eies sam the first thing which we are here to desire is that wee may haue grace to denie our selues wils and affections because herein wee are vnlike to god and like the deuill this is the first lesson that our sauiour doeth giue his disciples that they must denie themselues and follow him the second thing is the knowledge of god will for otherwise how shal we do it how shall that servant please his maister which cannot tell what hee would haue done of him most man will haue bookes of statutes in their houses and if they be to deal in any great matter they will do nothing vntil they haue looked on the statute in like maner man must haue the bible that is the booke of god statutes in their houses the lawes of god must bee the man of our counsel before euerie action wee are to searche what is the will of god and then to doe it here the wee are taught to vse the meanes and to pray for knowledge againe we are here taught to haue a desire in our hearts and an indeuour in our liues in all things to do obedience to god word lastlie we desire patience and strength when it shall please god at anie time to exercise vs with the crosse as paul prayes for the colossians that god would strengthe them by the power of his might vnto all patience and long suffering with ioy fulnesse the church of rome teacheth that man by nature haue free will to good and that man being stirred vp by the holy ghost can of themselues will that which is good but if this were so why might we not pray let my will bee done so far foorth as the will of man shall agree with god will but this cannot be as we see in the tenour of this petition hauing shewed the meaning of this petition thy vvill be done now we are to speake of the condition which is in what maner we shuld doe it for the question may be how we should doe god will the answer is his wil must be done in earth as it is in heauen heauen by heaue here is meant the soules of faithfull man departed and the elect angels psalm praise the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that doe his commandements in obeying the voice of his vvord earth by earth is vnderstood nothing but man on earth becaus all other creatures in their kind obey god only man he is rebellious and disobedient then the meaning is let thy will be done by vs man on earth as the angels and saintes departed doe thy will in heauen qu do we here desire to do the will of god in that perfection it is done by angels must we be as perfit as they ans the wordes here vsed in earth as it ampc do not signifie an equalitie as though our obedience should in this life be in the same degre of perfection with with angels but a similitude or the like maner of obeying it may be said in what maner do the angels obey god answer they doe the wil of god willingly speedily and faithfully and this is signified in that they are saide in the scriptures to bee winged and to stand continually beholding the face of our heauenly father and this is the manner in which we desire to performe god will vve are heere admonished to bee displeased with our selues for our imperfect obedience to god amp for our hypocrisie priuie pride presumptio deadnes of spirit and many other wants which breake out when we are in doing god will there is no servant of god but hath wants in his best works so we must vnderstand paul ro he saith as much as if he culd begin a good thing but not perfect it amp go through stitch as we say whe the godly do good works as heare speak god word pray praise god ampc they perform things acceptable to god but in these actions they finde matter of mourning namely the imperfectio of the work therfore dauid praieth psalm enter not into iudgement vvith thy servant and here we may see how far wide the church of rome is that holds good works to be any way meritorious that be euery way imperfect if the me of that church had grace they might see that the corruptios of the flesh wer as gynes amp fetters about their legs that when they would faine runne the waies of god commadements they are constrained to halt downe right and to trail their loynes after them the grace here to be desired is synceritie of heart in doing god will so as wee may keepe a good conscience before god and man act and for this cause i indeuoured alwaies to haue a clear conscience towards god and towards man this must we hunger after amp pray for seing it is not sufficient to abstaine from euill but also to doe good and in doing good striue to come to perfection thus much of the thre first petitions which concerne god now follow the other three which concern our selues in which order we learn to pray for those things which concerne god absolutelie and for those thinges which concerne our selues not absolutely but so farre foorth as they shall make for god his glorie the building of his kingdom and the doing of his wil but how dependes this petition on the former in the first wee are taught to pray that god name might bee hallowed which is done whe god raigns in our hearts amp his wil is done now further his will is obeyed in three thinges first by depending on his prouidence for the thinges of this life secondly by depending on his mercy for the pardon of sin thirdly by depending on his power and might in resisting temptations and thus god will is obeyed bread by this one means of sustayning our body and temporarie liues all other meanes are vnderstood as meat drinke cloathing helth liberty peace ampc gen thou shalt eat thy bread vz get thy liuing in the sweat of thy browes out of this we learn instructions for why doth the lord teache vs to craue onely bread and not meate and other dainties it is for causes the first is that we might hereby learn frugalitie and moderation in our diet apparel houses and be content if wee haue no more but bread seeing wee desire no more we must not with the israelites murmur because they had nothing but manna quest must wee vse god creatures onely for necessitie ans we may vse them not onely for necessitie but also for honest delight amp plesure psalm god giues wine to make glad the heart of man and oyle to make his face shine and john our sauiour christ allowed of the fact of mary which tooke a pounde of ointment of spikenard very costly and annointed his very feete so that all the house was filled with the smell though iudas did esteeme it wast but yet if the lord shall graunt but breade that is so much as shal but holde bodie and soule togither wee must bee content therewith tim ver therefore vvhen vvee hauue foode and raiment let vs be therewith content this contentation was in iacob gene a second cause is to teache vs that there is a particular prouidence all man confesse that there is a generall prouidence of god ouer all thinges but here wee must acknowledg an other more speciall euen in the least thinges that be because euery morsell of bread which we eate wold no more nourish vs then a peece of earth or a stone vnlesse god gaue his blessing vnto it daily the worde in the originall is thus much in effect bread vnto our essence or substances then the meaning is giue vs such bread from day to day as may nourishe our substances thus praieth agur prou feede me with food conuenient for me some there ar which put an angelical perfection in fasting but we are taught in scriptures that as aboue all thinges we are to seeke for life eternall so wee must in this life sustaine and maintaine our naturall body so long as we liue in this world fasting in it selfe as it is abstinence is no part of god worship but in it own nature a thing indifferent and therefore it is to bee vsed so farre forth as it shal further vs in prayer and no further for seeing we ar taught to pray for such food as shall preserue nature and maintaine the vitall blood we must not vse fasting to the hindrance or destruction of nature our bread question how is bread ours corinthian ye are christes and all things ar yours so then by meanes of christe bread is called ours for god hauing giuen christ to vs doeth in him and by him giue all thinges els to vs question howe may i knowe that the thinges i enjoy are mine by christ and that i doe not vsurpe them answere tim paule saieth that the creatures of god are good and that the vse of them is sanctified to vs by the word and prayer then if we haue the word of god to tel vs that we may enjoy and vse them and also if we pray to god for the right and pure vse of them wee are no vsurpers but indeed right owners of them question if the creatures must be made ours by christ howe comes it to passe that the vngodlie haue such abundance of them answer we lost the title and interest of the creatures in adam yet god of his mercie bestowes temporarie blessings vpon the vniust aswell as vpon the iust but for all that vnlesse they be in christ and hold the title of them by him they shal in the end turn to their great condenatio and whereas we cal it our bread wee learne that euery man must liue of his owne calling and his owne goods here also is condemned all oppression stealing lying cogging and other such deceitfull meanes to get wealth and goods many think it no sinne to prouide for their familie in such order but in saying this petition they pray against themselues thes hee vvhich laboureth not let him not eate ephesian he vvhich stole let him steale no more but rather labour vvith his hands the thing that good is this day we say not heere this weeke this month this age but this day what meanes this may yee not prouide for the time to come answere it is lawful yes a man is bound in good maner to prouide for time to come act the apostles prouide for the church in iudaea against the time of dearth spoken of by agabus and ioseph in egypt in the years of plentie stored vp against the yeares of famine wherefore in these words our sauiour his meaning is only to codemn al distrust full care and to teach vs to rest on his fatherlie goodnes from day to day in euerie season this is noted vnto vs numb where the israelits wer commanded to gather no more manna than would serue for one day amp if they did it putrified wherby god taught them to rest on his prouidence euery particular day and not on the means giue vs not me this serues to teache vs that a man must not onelie regarde himselfe but also be mindfull of others for a man that hath welth is made a steward to distribute his goods to the poore and the good of god church true loue seekes not her owne things the branches of the vine are loaded with clusters of grapes not for themselues but for others the candle spends it self to giue others light giue if bread be ours wherefore are we to ask it it may seeme needles answer not so for hereby we are taught very worthie lessons first those that are in pouertie are taught to wait on god who is the fountaine and giuer of al blessings man vsuallie driuen to this estate vse euill meanes as robbing deceiuing consulting with wisards ampc againe here we learne that thogh a man had al the wealth in the world all is nothing without god blessing quest the rich need not say giue s ampc for they haue aboundance already and what neede they aske that which they haue answer let a man be neuer so rich and want nothing that can be desired yet if hee want god blessing in effect he wants al wherfore euen kings and the greatest personages that be are as much bounde to vse this petition as the poorest god blessing is riches saith salomon pro thou maiest eat and not haue inough be clothed and not warm earne wages and put it in a broke bagge hag if god do not blesse thee this blessing of god is called the staffe of bread esay in bread there be two thinges the substance and the vertue fro god blessing this second that is the power of nourishing is the staff of bread for take away from an aged man his staffe and he falls amp so take away god blessing from bread it becomes vnprofitable amp ceaseth to nourish lastly here wee see that all labour and toyle taken in any kind of calling is nothing and auailes not vnlesse god still giue his blessing psalm ovr corruptions against this petition are two especially i couetousnesse a vice which is naturally ingraffed in euery mans heart it is when a man is not content with his present estate this desire is vnsatiable for man wold be euer hauing of more wherfore hee which shall vse this petition must be grieued for this sinne and pray with dauid psalm incline my hearte to thy commaundements and not to couetousnesse and hee must sorrowe not so much for the act of this sinne as for the corruption of nature in this behalfe couetous people will plead that they are free from this vice but mark mens liues and wee shall see that this is a common disease in the most as it is noted psalm who vvill shew vs any good this then is a common sin that we ar taught to mourne for the second want is our diffidence and distrustfulnes for the thinges of this life man also will shift this off and say they wold be sorie to distrust god but if wee looke to our corrupt nature man is wonderfull prone to this sinne for being in prosperitie we ar not troubled but if once wee be pressed with aduersitie then we houle and weep and as paul saith tim man pearce themselues throgh vvith many sorrowes if any shall lose a parte of his goodes what then doth hee straight hee goes out to the wise man is this to beleeue in god no it is to distrust god and beleeue the deuill the grace to be desired is a redinesse in all estates to rest on god prouidence whatsoeuer fall out psalm commit thy vvay to the lord and trust in him and hee shall bring it to passe prou commit or role thy workes vpon the lord and thie thoughts shal be directed whereby we ar admonished to take pains in our callings to gette meate and drink ampc if the lorde blesse not our labour wee must be content if he do we must giue him thanks now for this cause wee are further to pray to god that hee would open our eies amp by his spirit teach vs in all his good creatures to see his prouidence and when meanes faile and are contrary then also to beleeue the same papistes teache that man by workes of grace may merit life eternall and increase of justification in this life but howe can this be for here we see that euery bit of bread which we eate is the free gift of god without any merite of ours now if we cannot merite a peece of bred what madnes is it to think that wee can merite life euerlasting they also are deceiued who thinke that any thing comes by meere chance or fortune without god prouidence indeede in respect of man who knowe not the causes of thinges many chances there are but so as they are ordered amp come to passe by god prouidence luke by chance there came downe a certaine priest that way this is the fift petition amp the second of those which concerne our selues in the former we craued temporall blessings in this and the next which followeth we craue spirituall blessings where we may note that seeing there be two petitions which concerne spirituall thinges amp but one for temporall that the care for our soules must be double to the care for our body in the world man care for their body their hearts are sette for wealth and promotion they can be content to heare the worde on the sabboth yet neither then nor in the weeke day do they lay it vp in their heartes and practise it which argues that they haue litle or no care for their soules question what is the cause that first we craue things for the body amp in the second place those which concerne the soule ans the order of the holy ghost in these petitions is wonderfull for the lorde considers the dulnes and backewardnes of mens natures therefore he trains them vp and draws them on by litle euen as a schoolmaister doth his young schollers propounding vnto them some elements and principles and so carrying them to higher pointes the former petition is a steppe or degree to these two following he that will rest on god so the pardon of his of al rest on god providence this life and hee that cannot put his affiance in god for the prouision of meat and drink how shall he trust in god mercie for the saluation of his soule here wee may see the faith of worldings they say that god is mercifull and that they beleeue in christ which how can it be true seeing in les er matters as meate and drinke they distrust god as appears by their couetousnes debts by debts sins ar meant so it is in luke and they are so called because of the resemblance betwene them for euen as a debt doth bind a man either to make satisfaction or else to goe to prison so our sinnes bind vs either to satisfie god iustice or els to suffer eternall damnation forgiue to forgiue sinne is to couer it or not to impute it psalm and this is done when god is content of his mercie to accept the death and passion of christ as a sufficient paiment and ransome for mans sinnes and so to esteeme them as no sinnes and here vnder this one benefit all the rest of the same kind are vnderstood as iustification sanctification redemption glorification ampc here we may learn many lessons the first is that seeing we must pray thus lord forgiue ampc we must hold that there is no satisfaction to god iustice for sinne by our workes no not in temporary punishments but that the doing away of our sinnes is of god meere fauour for to forgiue and to satisfie be contrary wherefore the doctrine of humain satisfactions taught in the church of rome is vile and diuelish secondly we are taught thus to pray continually from day to day where we note the great patience and long suffering of god in that we offending daily yet he suffers and forbears still and doeth not powre out his confusion vpon vs this teacheth vs like patience towards our brother we cannot put vp the least iniury and forbear but one day yet we desire that god wold forgiue vs all our liues long againe we may obserue that there is no perfect sanctification in this life seeing we must euery day to the end craue the pardo of our sinnes therefore wicked is the opinion of the catharists or puritans which hold that man may be without sinne in this life and when we say forgiue not me but vs we are put in minde to pray not onely for the pardone of our owne sinnes but likewise for our brother and enemy iam confesse one to another and pray one for another for the praier of the righteous auaileth much if it be feruent and as so ne think the praier of steuen was a meanes of the conuersion of saule also we note that before praier for pardon of sinne must go a confession of sinne for whereas we say forgiue our debts we confes before god that we ar stat banckrouts and not able to discharge the least of our sinnes this appears ioh if vve confesse our sinnes he is faithful to forgiue vs and it was practised by dauid psalm and the maner of making confession is this knowen sinnes and those which troble the conscience are to be confessed particularlie but vnknown sins generally psalm lastly hence it is manifest that there is noe iustification by workes our sinnes are debtes amp so also are all workes of the lawe now how can any man discharge one debt by another the wantes to be bewailed are the burden of our sinnes and the corruptions of our natures amp the wickednes of our liues and the sinnes of our youth and of our old age psalm my sinnes haue taken such hold vpon me that i am not able to looke vp they are more in number then the haires of my head therefore mine heart hath failed me thus with dauid we are to trauell and grone vnder this burden but this griefe for sin is a rare thing in the world man can mourne bitterly for the thinges of this life but their sinnes neuer trouble them and further this sorrowe must be for sinne because it is sinne though there were neither hell nor deuill nor conscience to accuse nor iudg to reuege the grace which wee must desire is the spirit of grace and deprecations zacha it is that worke of the spirit whereby wee are inabled to call to god for the pardone of our sinnes a man hauing offeded the laws of a prince and being in danger of death will neuer rest or be at quiet till hee haue gotten a pardon eue so they which feele and see their sinnes hauing this spirite are so mooued that they can neuer be at rest till in praier they be eased of their sins a man may i graunt babble and speake many wordes but hee shall neuer pray effectually before hee haue this spirit of praier to make him crie abba father for worldly comodities all can pray but learn to pray for the want of christ these wordes be a part of the fift petition for it is put down with a condition forgiue vs as we forgiue others and these wordes depend on the former as the reason thereof and it is taken from the comparison of the lesse to the greater thus if wee who haue but a sparke of mercie doe forgiue others then doe thou who article the fountaine of mercie forgiue vs but we forgiue others therefore do thou forgiue vs thus luke hath it forgiue vs our sinnes for euen we forgiue the papists gather a contrarie doctrine they say forgiue vs as we forgiue making our forgiuing a cause for which god is mooued to forgiue vs but we are to know that our forgiuing is no cause but a sign that god wil forgiue vs qvestion whether is a man bounde to forgiue all debts answer the word debt in this place is not vnderstoode of debt that is ciuill and comes by lawful bargaining but of hurtes and dammages which ar done vnto vs in our body goods or good name as for the former ciuil debts a man may exact them so he doe it with shewing of mercie question how may anie man forgiue trespasses seeing god onlie forgiues sin answer in euerie trespasse which anie do to their neighbours ther be two offences one to god another to man in the first respect it is called a sin which god onlie forgiues in the other respect it is called an injurie or dammage amp so man may forgiue it when a man is robbed the law is broken by stealing and the injurie that is done is against a man that hath his goods stolne this injurie as it is an injurie a man may forgiue but as it is a sinne he can not but god onlie quest whether may a man aright pray this petition and yet sue him at the law who hath injured him an yes for a man may in an holie maner sew another for an injury and as a souldier in lawful war may kill his enemie and yet loue him so may a man forgiue an injurie and yet seeke in a christian maner the remedie but in doing of this wee must obserue fiue thinges we are to tak heed of all priuate revenge and inward hatred which if we conceiue wee doe not forgiue we must take heed of offence and haue care that our doinges bee not scandelous to the church our sutes must be taken in hand to maintaine godly peace for if all injuries were put vp there would bee no ciuill state or gouernment it must be that the partie offending may bee chastised and bee brought to repentance for his fault for if many me were not repressed they woulde growe worse law must bee the last remedie as physitions vse desperate remedies when weaker wil not serue euen so must we vse law as the last meanes when all other faile the dealing of the worlde in this case is no example for vs to follow for through rage and stomacke they will abide no priuate agreement and therefore they vse the law in the first place so did the corinthians but what saith paule corinthian it is vtterlie a fault among but if the lawe bee vsed aright a christian may sue at law and loue the partie sued for there is difference betweene dealing against a man before a magistrate and the dealing of one priuat man with another for priuate dealing is commonlie reuenge and therefore unlawful the vse of this clause is verie profitable for it shewes vs a liuelie signe whereby our consciences may bee assured of the pardon of our sinnes indeed manie vse these wordes long and often yet finde no assurance of pardon and the cause is because they haue no desire of god mercie nor willingnes to forgiue man which if they had then the forgiuenes of their sinnes should hereby be sealed vnto them wherefore if any wold be perswaded of god mercie in this point let them discend into their owne soules and search them narrowlie if they can finde their heartes as readie to forgiue as they are readie to desire forgiuenes at god hand then they may assure themselues of god mercie in christ as we are taught by our sauiour christ mat blessed are the merciful for they shall obtaine mercie consider these comparisons a man walking vnder a wal in a cold sunnie day is heated of the wall which first receiued heat from the sun so he that sheweth mercie to others hath first receiued mercie from god also take a peece of waxe and put to a seale it leaueth an impression or marke like it selfe in the waxe which when a man lookes on he doth certainlie know that ther hath bin a seale the print whereof is left behind euen so it is in euery one that hath readinesse to forgiue others by it a christian may easilie know that god hath sealed to him the forgiuenesse of his sinnes euen in his heart therefore let man looke into their hearts whether they haue any affection to forgiue others for that is as it were the print in their harts of god mercy toward the manie there are which pray for pardon at god hande but they cannot brooke it that they should forgiue their neighbours herevpon come these sayinges i may forgiue him but i will not forget him he may come in my paternoster but hee shall not come in my creed behold the devil logicke which makes malice to bee charitie blinde people play with the lord prayer as the flie doeth with the candle till she bee burnt for the more they pray these words the more they call for vengeance against theselues iam it might seem to some that this petition is superfluous for what need he care for temptations that hath the pardon of his sinnes but our sauiour did not teach vs thus to pray without speciall reason because forgiuenesse of sinnes and wonderfull temptations bee inseperable companions in this life which thing wee finde to be true both in god word and in christian experience there is no man in this world so beaten and buffeted with temptations as the penitent sinner that cries most bitterlie for the pardon of his sins this is the estate that fewe man in the worlde are acquainted with for they ar neuer troubled with temptation but liue in all peace amp quietnes both in bodie and soule luke when the strong man armed keepes his hold the thinges that he possesseth are in peace euen so the wicked of the world being possessed of satan are not a whit molested by him with any temptatios neither need he seeing hee hath them at commandement to doe what he wil but when a man once begins to make conscience of sin and to sue vnto the lord for pardon of his offences and still continues in dislike of sinne and sathan then the enemie bestirs him and vseth all means to bring that man to famine he offereth all maner of temptations to molest him and neuer affoord this poore sinner anie rest hereupon hee for feare of being ouercome continuallie must pray vnto the lord that he may not be led into temptatio here some christian conscience may reason thus no man is so troubled with sin and satan as i therefore i am not in god fauour but am a plaine cast away ans if pardon of sinne and temptations goe together al is contrarie if thou hadst no griefe for sin no buffeting of thine enemy the flesh the world and the devil thou couldst not be in god fauor but vnder the power of sata now this great mesure of the spiritual temptations is a signe rather of god loue for who god loues the devil hates and where god workes in loue the deuill workes in malice these wordes be but all one petitio which hath two parts the latter being a declaration of the former lead vs not into temptation how is that done by deliuering vs from euill temptation temptation is nothing els but the entisement of the soul or heart either by the corruption of mans nature or the allurements of the world or the deuill to any sinne iam god temptes no man that is god moues no man to sinne lead vs not or carrie vs not into temptation to be led is to be ouercome of the temptation whe it preuailes and gets the victorie then the meaning is this when wee are mooued or entised to sin lord keepe vs that wee be not ouercome and giue thou an issue with the temptation question god is iust and cannot sinne but if he lead man into temtation shall he not be the authour of sinne answer indeed many fearing to charge god with sin read the wordes thus suffer vs not to be led but the text is very piaine leade or carrie vs not and the scriptures elsewhere vse the like phrases of god exod god is said to harden pharaos heart sam the lorde mooued dauid to number the people thes god sent strong delusions that man might beleeue lies these and such like places haue a woorthie meaning thus to be gathered there is no action of man or of the devil absolutely evil but although in some respects it be euill yet in some other it is good for we are not thus to think that as there is a maine good so also there is a maine euill thus then temptation being an action it is not in euery respect euill but in some good in some euill and so farre forth as it is good the lord workes it but as it is euill he doth not worke it but willingly permits it to be done by him amp satan and there be foure respects in which god may be a worker in temptations and yet be free from sinne first he tempteth by offer occasions and objects to trie whether a man will sinne or not a maister suspecting his seruat that in worde professeth fidelitie layes a purse of money in his way to try if he will steale it which if he steal he hath found by watching him a secreete theefe and so hath laide him open for deceiuing any more nowe this trying o him is no sin though he sinne in stealing in the same manner tempteth god his owne servant to prooue and trye them deut tho shalt not harken unto the of the prophet or dre amer of dreames in the lord your god pro whether yee loue the rd your god with al your hart secondly god leades into temptation by withdrawing his grace neither can this be a sinne in god because he is bound to no man to giue him grace and heere is a difference betweene the tempting of god amp sathan god holds backe grace when hee tempteth the deuill suggesteth euill morions euery action so far foorth as it is an action is good amp of god act in him we liue mooue and haue our being therfore god is a worker in temptations so far forth as they ar actions one man killes another the very mouing of the body in the doing of this villanie is of god but the wickednes of the action is from man and the deuill againe a man rides vpon a lame horse and stirres him the rider is the cause of the motion but the horse himselfe of the halting motion so god is the author of euery action but not of the euill of the action the fourth way is in regarde of the end god tempts his seruats only to correct and humble them for their sinnes and to trye howe they will abide the crosse and to moue them the more to loue him deut god afflictes the children of israell to trie them whether they would keepe his commandements chronicle he trieth hezekiah to see what was in his hart the devil end in tempting is onely to bring the partie vnto destruction thus we neede not for to say that god in some respectes doth leade his servant into temptations deliuer vs from euill that is free vs from the power of the flesh the deuill and the world some take evil in this place only for the devil but wee may take it more largely for all spirituall enemy john the vvhole world lyeth in euill vz vnder the power of sinne and satan these words as i haue said are a proofe and explanation of the former for when a man is deliuered from euill he is not led into temptation the cause being taken away the effect ceaseth hence wee learne what a righteous god iehoua is that can work an euill action amp yet be void of sinne whereas we say lead vs not ampc we note that the devil in teptations can go noe further then god permits him wee are not to pray that temptations be quite taken from vs or that we be whollie freed fro them but that they doe not ouercome vs for it is the lordes wil that his church should be tempted nay dauid desired some kind of temptations psalm prooue me o lord and iames saith account it for exceeding ioy when ye shall fal into diverse temptations iam note also that euery man by nature is the bodslaue of sin amp satan for where is deliuerace there was a bondage first this confutes the papists who maintain fre wil for we ar dead in him by nature as a man in a graue and we must still pray thus til we be fully deliuered the corruption which in this petition we ought to mourn for is the continuall rebellion of our wicked natures amp our pronenes to yeeld vp our selues in euery temptation to sin and satan and the remnants of the old bondage vnder satan must be grieuous and irkesome vnto vs and we must bewaile it very bitterly the iewes in a bodily captiuitie wept vvhen they remembred sion psalm howe much more should we weep when we feele the lawe of our members rebelling against the lawe of our minds amp leading vs captiue to sin the contrary blessing to bee desired is that god woulde stablish vs by his free spirit ps which is so called because it settes vs euery day more amp more at liber tie out of the reach of sin amp satan these words containe a reason of all the former petitions whereby we are mooued to craue thinges needfull at god hand thine is earthly kinges haue kingdome power and glorie daniel yet not from themselues but fro god whose vice gerents they are on earth therfore to make a difference betwene god kingdome power and glory amp those of earthly kings it is said thine is the kingdome ampc that is god hath all these in himself and from himself and they from him the kingdome these wordes chronicle at fully expounded thine o lord is greatnesse power and victorie and praise for al that is in heauen amp earth is thine thine is the kingdome amp thou excellest as head ouer al ampc the kingdome is said to bee god because hee is absolute possessor and owner of al things that are and also hath soueraigne rule ouer all things at his will nowe out of this first propertie of god we may gather a strong motiue to induce vs to pray vnto him alone for seeing all thinges are his both in heauen and earth whatsoeuer therefore wee must come to him for the graces and blessings which wee desire the power oftentimes earthly princes haue kingdomes yet want power but god hath kingdom amp power also yes his power is infinite and he can do al that he wil amp more then hee will as for those things which come of impotencie he cannot do the for if he c ld he should not be omnipotent and as he is omnipotent in himselfe so all the power which any creture hath is from him alone question howe can this be seeing the deuill hath power to sinne which is not from god ans er to sinne is no power but rather a want of power otherwise all the strength and power that satan hath is of god and from this second property is taken another motiue to moue vs to pray vnto god because all power being his wee can neuer do any of the thinges which we aske but by power receiued from him thine is the glory this thirde propertie of god ariseth from the two former for seeing the title amp interest in all things and the power whereby they are disposed and gouerned is of god therefore it followes that all glory is his yes in him is fulnes of glory and the glory of the creature is all of him to sinfull man belonges nothing but shame and confusion daniel verse this third propertie ministreth a thirde motiue to induce man to pray vnto god alone for seeing all glory by right is his therefore wee must invocate his holy name that in so doing we may giue him the glory due vnto him for euer the words in the originall are for ages nowe an age signifies the space of an hundred years but here it is taken for eternitie because eternitie is nothing but the multiplication of ages and as eternitie is heere noted by ages so on the contrary we reade that eternitie is take for a certaine and distinct time gen god promiseth abraham to giue him the lande of canaan for an euerlasting possession that is for a long season for els abrahams seede shuld inherite the lande vntill this time which it doth not wherfore as often the whol is put for the part vz eternitie for a certaine time so here the part is put for the whole an age for eternitie this also maketh a difference betweene earthly princes and the mightie iehouah they haue kingdome power and glory for a short time but hee absolutely and for euer here wee learne in praier to abase our selues before god and vtterly to deny all that is in vs kingdome power amp glory is all his not ours wee are no better then rebels and traitors to him if we haue any good thing it is fro him euen the grace whereby we pray and hee that in praier will not confesse this shal no more be heard then the insolent begger that wil not acknowledg his want secondly againe in praier we learne that we must be perswaded of two things and build vpon them god power and will his power in that he is able his wil in that he is careful to performe our requests as it was noted in the preface the first of these is set out in his kingdome and power the second is noted in that glory is his corinthian for al the promises of god in him ar yes amp amen vnto the glory of god and hence wee gather that praier and thanks giuing must go together for as in the six petitions wee made request to god so in these wordes we giue him thanks and praise him philipp but in al thinges let your requests be shevved to god in praier and supplication vvith thanksgiuing there is none but in want he will be ready to pray but when we haue receiued we ar slack in giuing of thanks but hee which wil pray aright must join the both together and the sum of all god praise stands in these three points that he is an absolute king secondly that hee hath absolute power to rule al thinges that hauing power and a kingdome he hath glory also which appears in the holding of his kingdome and the hewing of his power in gouerning of it whatsoeuer we ask we must refer it to god glorie this is the first thing which wee were taught to craue and the we ar to performe because it is noted both in the beginning amp end of the praier thus muche of the vse of these words altogether now let vs mak vse of the particularly first where as we say thine is the kingdome magistrates and rulers must knowe that all the authoritie and rule which they haue is from the lord amp therefore they must remember to order themselues as god vicegerents vsing their power to bring man in subjection to god lawes and referring all their callings to his glorie where we say thine is the power wee are admonished when we are to performe anie worke as to doe seruice to god to walk in our callings that we haue no power of our selues and for this cause wee must ask power at god handes that we may be enabled to walke vprightly before him and doe our duties in saying thine is the glory we learn that if we wold haue a good report and praise among man wee must aboue all things seeke god glorie not regarding so much our own if he giue thee praise among man giue him thankes if not be content because al glorie is his vve haue heard the preface and the petitions what they are now followeth the third part which is the assent or testification of faith required in prayer in this word amen and it containes more than man at the first woulde imagine it signifies certainlie so be it or it shal be so corinthian it is often taken for a bare assent of the people saying amen to the minister but in this place it containes more for euerie point in this prayer is not onlie a direction for publike prayer but for priuate also and must be saide as well of the minister as of the people nowe then there being two principall thinges in prayer the first a desire of grace the secod faith whereby wee beleeue that god will grant things desired the first is expressed in the sixe petitions the latter is set forth in this worde amen carrying this sence in effect as we haue craued these thinges at thy handes o lord so we doe beleeue that for christ his sake in good time thou wilt grant them to vs therefore this part is more excellent than the former by howe much our faith is more excellent than our desire for in this word is contained the testification of our faith whereas the petitions are onlie testifications of our desires and as it is in the end so also it is the seale of our prayers to make them authentic and it is to be vsed as i take it not onlie for this end to answer the minister but also to testifie our faith for the things desired hereby wee are taught what grace we ar to shew in praier we must labour to giue assent to god promises when we pray amp striue against doubting and vnbeleefe mark lord i beleeue lord help my vnbeleefe psalm why article thou cast down my soul and why article thou within me wait on god manie there are that wil stande vpon the strength of their faith amp plead for themselues that they neuer doubted but they ar far wide for true faith beeing imperfect is alwaies accompanied with doubting more or lesse wherefore the heart which feeles no doubting is not filled with faith but with presumption as for them which are molested with doubtings amp complaine of them they haue lesse cause to feare for as fire and water do neuer striue til they meete no more doth doubting and vnbeleefe til faith come into a man to conclude we see what an excellent worke prayer is in which two moste excellent graces of a christian man bee shewed foorth hungring after mercy amp faith this might moue man to learn to pray praier being the exercise of grace the principal vse of the lord prayer is to direct god his church in making their praiers in all places at al times and vpon all occasions though their praiers should be innumerable and vnles they be framed after this they can not be right in the vsing of it for direction there be three thinges required the first is the knowledge of the lordes prayer and al the partes thereof he that would pray by it must vnderstad the meaning therof the wants therein to be bewailed and the graces to bee desired for which end it hath bin expounded knowing this there is in the seconde place required thus much skil that he be able to referr euerie want amp grace to one of the sixe petitions for example feeling in himselfe pride of heart he must be able to say this is a want in the first petition and feeling a rebellion amp slownes in doing god commandment he must be able to say this is a sin to be prayed against in the petition thus euery want he must refer to his proper hed again he must refer euery grace to be desired to one of the sixe petitions is stregth in temptation to the sixt assiance in god prouidence to the fourth knowledge of god to the first ampc and so in the rest in the third place he must before he pray consider what bee his wantes and imperfections which moste trouble him as also the graces which he wold obtain then for the helping of his memorie he must goe to the petitions and he must set those thinges first in his mind which do concern the first petition and those which concern the second petition must haue the second place in his mind and so he must proceed in order as shall haue occasion thus a man keeping in minde the order of the petitions as they stand shall be able by referring euery grace and want vnto his proper head to mak a distinct prayer and to varie it as time place and other occasions shall moue him quest must we of necessity follow al the petitions in conceiuing a praier an no but only those which doe principallie belong to the time place amp occasion as paule maketh a prayer column and all the points of it may be referred to the third and last petitions againe a christian man may mak an excellent confession of his sins by this praier if he shal keping the order of the petitions confesse and bewaile the sins which euerie petition requires vs to pray against amp it serues to mak a thanksgiuing to god thus let a man remember all the graces which he hath receiued from god let him then refer them to the petitions and giue thankes to god after the order of them turning euery petition into a thanksgiuing quest whether a man is to vse a voice in prayer ans in publik praier it is requisite that there bee a voice for the minister is the month of the people and to the prayer which hee conceiues they giue assent for priuate prayer vsing of a voice is conuenient yet so as it may be done in silence the lord gaue vs the voyce as well as the heart to blesse him withall iam god created the tong as wel as the heart and so will bee praised by both the voice often stir vp the heart and againe the vehemecie of affection doth often draw out a voice the voice then in priuate prayer is requisite yet in some cases may bee omitted for it is not absolutely necessarie moses and anna prayed in silence quest what gesture is to bee vsed in prayer an the word doth not affoord any certain direction our sauiour amp his disciples praied in diverse gestures kneling standing groueling looking to heauen looking downe to the earth sitting lying ampc luke act god respectes not the gesture but the affection of the heart yet two thinges must be alwaies in the gesture that it be comelie that it do fitlie expresse the affection of the hart as when we ask mercie to look to heauen when wee bewaile our sins to look downward ampc question what place must we pray in an the place is set down tim we may pray in all places of which ther is no difference some will say that in the time of the law the tabernacle and temple were places for diuine prayer ans the temple and tabernacle wer types of christ amp his church and the vnitie of it but now wee hauing the thing it selfe signified thereby may pray in al places our sauior prayed in the wildernes on the mount peter on the house top paule by the sea shore yet so that publik praier must be vsed in publike places as churches chappels ampc not because in them is more holinesse but for orders sake quest what is the time appointed for praier ans praie continuallie the that is vpon al occasions or whe a man begins any busines whether it be in word or deed column or as daniel who praied thrise euerie daie daniel or as dauid who praied at euening morning and noontide ps and seuen times a daie vz many psalm thus we shal pray continuallie euery day affoords three especial occasions the entrance to our callings in the morning the receiuing of god creatures at noonetide the going to rest at night hitherto we haue spoken of the making of prayer to god a word or two of god his hearing our prayers question how many waies doth god hear mens praiers ans two waies the first in his mercie when he graunts the requests of such as call vpon him in the feare of his name secondly hee heares mens praiers in his wrath thus he gaue the israelites quailes according to their desire psalme thus often man curse themselues and wish that they were dead and accordinglie they haue their wish quest why doth god defer to hear the praiers of his servant ans to prooue them by delay to exercise their saith to make them acknowledge that the things which they receiue ar god gifts and not from themselues that graces quickly giuen might not be lightlie estemed that an hungring after grace might bee sharpened and increased quest after what maner doth god hear his servant prayers an two waies first by granting the thing which was asked according to his will secondly by denying the thing desired and by giuing somthing proportional to it thus god denies temporary blessings and in the roome thereof giues eternall in heauen thus he refuseth to remoue the crosse from his servantes and giues in stead thereof strength and patience christ praied that the cup might bee remooved it was not remooued but hee in his manhood was enabled to beare the wrath of god when these wordes containe two partes a praier and a thanksgiuing in the praier these pointes are to be marked first the gesture i bowe my knees whereby paul signifieth his humble submission vnto god in praier secondly to whom he praies to the father who is described by two titles the first the father of our lord iesus christ and that by nature as he is god and as hee is man by personall vnion the other title of vvhome the whole familie which is in heauen and earth is named in which words is set down a description of the church first it is a familie because it is the company of god elect children vnder the gouernment of one father timoth it is called the house of god ephesian they that beleeue are saide to be of the household of god secondly the partes of the catholicke church are noted namely the saintes in heauen departed and saintes liuing on earth thirdly it is said to be named of the father of christ because as the father of christ is the father of this familie so also this familie is called by him genes daniel thirdly the matter of the praier standes of foure moste worthie points the first is strength to bear the crosse and to resist spiritual temptations verse where this strenth is sette out by diverse arguments first that it is the meere gifte of god that he wold grant you secondly the cause of strength by his spirit thirdly the subiect or place wher this strength must bee in the inner man that is in the whole man so farre foorth as hee is renewed by grace ephesian the second is the dwelling of christ by faith in their hearts faith is when a man beeing seriously humbled for his sinnes is further in consciece perswaded and resolued of the pardon of the and of reconciliation to god now where this perswasion is indeede there followes necessarilie christs dwelling in the heart which stands in two thinges the first is the ordering and ruling of the thoghts affections and desires of the heart according to his will as a maister rules in his house the second is the continuance of his rule for hee cannot be saide to dwell in a place who rules in it but for a day the third is the knowledg and the acknowledgement of the infinite greatnes of god his loue in christ an effect of the former verse the wordes are thus explaned rooted and grounded here the loue of god wherewith hee loues the elect is as a roote and foundation of all god benefits election vocation iustification and glorification man ar rooted and grounded in loue when god spirite assures their hearts of god loue amp doth giue them some inward sense and feeling of it for then they are as it were sensiblie put into the roote and laid on the foundation with al saintes paule desires this benefite not onely to the ephesians but also for all the faithfull with them what is the length the bredth here is a speech borrowed from geomitricians and it signifieth the absolute greatnes or infinitenes of god loue and that it is like a worlde which for length bredth height amp depth is endles heere note the order of receuing grace first christ dwelles in the hart by faith secondly the comes a sense and feeling of god loue as it were by certain drops thereof thirdly after this ariseth a pletifull knowledge and apprehension of god loue and as it wer the powring out of a sea into a mans heart that for greatnes hath neither bottome nor bank and knowe the loue of christ these wordes as i take it are an exposition of the former for to comprehende the loue of god is nothing else but to knowe the loue of christ considering that all whome the father loueth hee loueth them in christ which passeth knowledge that is which for the greatnes of it noe man can fullie know the fourth thing is the fulnesse of god graces verse here the fulnesse of god doth not signifie the fulnes of the godhead or deuine nature but the perfection of the inner man which shall not be till after this life nowe followes the thaksgiuing or the praise of god ver containing these points the matter of praise his power and bountifulnes whereby he canne worke exceeding aboundantly aboue all we ask or think and both these are not only to be conceiued in mind but also may be felt in the heart according to the power that worketh in vs the forme of praise glorie vnto god by christ as all benefits are receiued from the father by christ the proper place of true praise of god the church the continuance of his praise through all generations for euer and this i praie that your loue maie abound yet more and more in knowledg and al sense that yee may discerne things that differ to the end yee may be pure and without offence to the daie of christ filled with fruites of righteousnes vvhich are by iesus christ vnto the praise and glorie of god this praier containes three parts in the first paul praieth for increase of loue in the philip whether it be to god or to man verse and he shewes the meanes of increase which ar two knowledg and sense or feeling for to goe backeward the more a godly man feeles god loue and hath experience of god word in himselfe the more he knowes god word and perceiues his loue vnto him the more hee is assured of god loue the more he loues god again and his neighbour for his sake the second thing praied for is the gift of discerning whereby me know what is true what fals what is to be done what to be left vndone the ends of this gift ar two the first that by meanes of it they may bee pure or sincere that is keepe a good conscience before god and man in their liues and callings the second is to be without offence that is innocent giuing no occasions of euill to any and not taking the offered by others and the continuance of these is noted to the daie of christ which is the time in which he commeth to vs either by our death or by the last judgement thirdly he praieth that they might abounde in good workes which ar described by a similitud fruits of righteousnes christians being fruitfull trees exech esay by the cause efficient which ar by christ by the end vnto the glorie and praise of god i cease not to praie for you and to desire that ye might be filled with knowledg of his will in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding that ye might vvalk vvorthie of the lord amp please him in al things fructifying in all good workes and increasing in the acknowledgment of god strengthened vvith all might thorough his glorious power vnto all patience and long suffering vvith ioyfulnes giuing thanks to the father which hath made vs fit to be partakers of the inheritace of the saints in light who hath deliuered vs from the power of darknesse and hath translated vs into the kingdome of his owne son these wordes containe a praier and a thankesgiuing in the praier three things are asked the first is the increase of the knowledge of god reueiled vvill in his worde and he deuides it into two partes wisdom which is not only to know god word but also to apply it to euery action for the right and holy performing thereof and spiritual vnderstanding which is when man by the assistance of god spirit do conceiue the will of god in general without applying secondly paule praies for the fruites of this knowledge which are foure to walke woorthy of god as good servant do who in their apparell gesture and all their doings

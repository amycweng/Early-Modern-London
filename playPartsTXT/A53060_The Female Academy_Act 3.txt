how do you like the lady and their discourse i like some of the lady discourse better than other and i like some of the lady better than the other but let we go hear the man those woman that retire themselves from the company of man be very ungrateful as first to nature because she make they only for breed next to man who be their defender protector their nourisher their maintainer their instructer their delighter their admirer their lover and deifier as man defend they from the rage bluster element by build they house and not only build they house for shelter but house for pleasure and magnificency also man protect they from wild ravenous and cruel beast that otherwise will devour they for as woman have not natural strength to build so have they not natural courage to sight be for the most part as fearful as weak likewise man nourish they for man fish fowl and hunt to get they food to feed they for which woman will neither take the pain nor endure the labour nor have the heart to kill their food for woman by nature be so pitiful and have such tender disposition as they will rather suffer death themselves than destroy life in other creature also man maintain they by compose themselves into commonwealth wherein be traffic and commerce that each family may live by each other also law to keep they in peace to rule they in order to defend they with arm which woman can never do by reason they know not what government to settle in or to nor what law to make or how to execute those law that be make neither can they plead suit decide cause judge controversy deal out right or punish injury or condemn criminal also man be the instructer to inform they of article and science which woman will never have have the patience to study for they will never have allow so much time and solitary muse for the perfect or devote those conception as those that first invent or find they out beside if woman be not instruct by man of the natural cause of effect how often will they have be affright almost to death with the loud and terrify thunder the flash lightning the dark eclipse the unsteady earthquake the overflow tide and many the like natural effect from hide cause beside woman will want all those conveniency that article afford they and furnish they with also man instruct woman with the mystery of the god whereas for want of which knowledge they will have be damn through ignorance also man be their delighter they traffic on the sea all over the world to every several climate and country to find and to bring the female sex curiosity hazard their life for the same whereas woman can neither build their ship nor guide they on the sea when they be build they have not strength to pull and tug great cable rope to set and spread large sail to cast and weigh massy anchor no not in a calm much less in furious storm with which man often fight though not with arm with subtlety and skill by which the element be conquer still whereas woman be conquer and not only be strengthless and heartless but healthless for not only the roar sea and whistle wind and rattle shower and rumble thunder and fiery lightning rock shelf and sand unknown or not to be avoid beside mountain of ice if to the northern pole all which will terrify they yet their weak body sick stomach and nice appetite can never endure long voyage they will vomit out their life before they can sail to their assign port or haven also man be woman admirer they gaze on their beauty and praise their sweet grace whereas woman through envy detract from each other also man be woman only true lover they flat kiss and please they whereas woman be apt to quarrel rail and fight with each other and last man deify woman make they goddess by their poetical description and elevation whereas nature make they mere mortal human creature wherefore it be a great ingratitude nay a horrid ingratitude in those woman that deny man their company conversation and communication wherefore man have not only reason to take it ill but to be angry with those woman that shun or restrain their company from they but good counsel ought to go before anger for the difference between good counsel and anger be that good counsel go before a fault be commit and anger follow when a fault be commit for as good counsel or admonishment be to prevent a fault so anger be a punishment for a fault past be your daughter put into the academy yes how long madam have your daughter be in the academy this week but she have not profit much for i do not hear her discourse first it be to be consider whether your daughter be capable of discourse for she must have a natural ingenuity to the article of rhetoric my daughter be always a pretty talk girl as any in all the country and town i live in yes child may talk pretty for child but when they come to be woman it be a question whether they will talk wise or no but let we go hear which of the lady discourse today lady for this time let the theme of your discourse be of discourse reverend matron this theme have be discourse of before by one of our academy but yet by reason one and the same theme may be discourse of after different manner or way i shall obey you as for discourse there be of four sort the first be discourse in the mind which be reason the second be discourse with word which be speak the three be discourse by sign which be action or act the last be discourse by figure which be by letter and hieroglyphic which be by print write paint and the like as for the first which be a discourse in the mind which be reason which reason be a discourse with thing and not with word as such a thing be not such a thing and what such thing be and what they be not or in what such thing agree or disagree sympathy or antipathy or such thing resemble or not resemble or on the cause of thing or their effect or the like this discourse be in the mind which be distinguish and distinguish belong to judgement the second discourse be with word which be speech and word be not thing or notch but only mark of thing or nick or notch to know thing by and the tongue be the tally on which they be score for speech be a number of word which word be make and join together by the breath tongue tooth and lip and the continuance make a discourse for a discourse be like a line or thread whereon be a number of word string like as a chain of bead if the word be well sort and fit and proper match as also evenl string the discourse be pleasant and delightful this chain of discourse be long or short according as the speaker please the three discourse be a discourse by sign which be in action as some can discourse by the motion of their face countenance hand finger pace or measure or by the cast of the eye and many such like posture look action and several such way of motion as have be invent to be understand this and the first kind of discourse as by thing and motion beast may have for aught we can know to the contrary the last be by figure or letter print hieroglyphic and paint story or engrave in metal or cut or carve in stone or mould or form in earth as clay or the like in this kind of discourse the pencil have sometime outdo the pen as the painter have outdo the historian and poet this discourse by sign or figure be discourse to the eye and not to the ear there be also another kind or sort of discourse which be hardly learn as yet because new invent or at lest to what i have hear which be by note and several strain in music i only mention it because i never hear it but once and then i do not understand it but yet it be by a skilful and ingenious musician which discourse a story of his travel in his play on a musical instrument namely the harpsical but certain to my understanding or reason it do seem a much easy way of discourse than discourse by action or posture but to end my discourse of discourse which discourse may be by several way several action and posture by several creature and in several language but reason be the soul language word the language of the sense action the life language write print paint carve and mould be article several language but music be the language of the god how do you like the lady discourse as i like discourse how be that why i have rather hear a number of word than speak a number of word then thou be not of the nature of mankind for there be no man that have not rather speak than hear no it be a sign i be not of the nature of womankind that will hear nothing but will speak all indeed for the most part they stop their ear with their tongue at lest with the sound of their voice it be too tedious to recite the several humour of the female sex their scornful pride their obstinate retiredness their reserve coyness their facile inconstancy by which they become the most useless and most unprofitable creature that nature have make but when they be join to man they be the most useful and most profitable creature nature have make wherefore all those woman that have common reason or sense of shame will never retire themselves from the company of man for what woman that have any consideration of honour truth or touch of goodness will be the worst of all creature when they may be the best but the truth of it be woman be spoil by the overfond dotage of man for be flat they become so self conceited as they think they be only make for the god and not for man and be mistress of man affection they usurp their masculine power and authority and instead of be dutiful humble and obedient to man as they ought to be they be tyrannical tyrannizer the young gallant methinks begin to be whet with anger they have reason when the woman have such dull blunt appetite lady let the theme of your discourse be at this time of friendship this theme may more easy be discourse of than friendship make by reason it be very difficult to make a right friendship for hard it be to match man in agreeable humour appetite passion capacity conversation custom action nature and disposition all which must be to make a true and last friendship otherwise two friend will be like two horse that draw contrary way whereas soul body education and life must equal agree in friendship for a worthy honest man can be a friend to a base and unworthy man by reason friendship be both a offensive and defensive league between two soul and body and no action either of the soul or body or any outward thing or fortune belong thereunto be to be deny wherefore knave with knave and unworthy person with unworthy person may make a friendship and honest man with honest man and worthy person with worthy person may do the like but a honest man with a knave or a worthy person with a base man or a honourable person with a mean fellow a noble soul with a base nature a coward with a valiant man can make no true friendship for put the case in such friendship my friend shall desire i to do a base action for his sake i must either break friendship or do unworthy but as all worthy person make truth their goddess which they seek and worship honour the saint which they pray too virtue the lady which they serve so honesty be the only friend they trust and rely on and all the world be oblige to honesty for upright and just deal

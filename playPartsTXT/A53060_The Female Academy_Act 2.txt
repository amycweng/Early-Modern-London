i suppose you have hear that a company of young gentleman have set up a academy next to the lady academy we hear nothing of it why then i will tell you the man be very angry that the woman shall speak so much and they so little i think for they have make that room which they stand in to see and hear the lady speak in so a place for themselves to speak in that the lady may hear what they can say faith if you will have my opinion it be that the man do it out of a mockery to the lady it be likely so for they rail extreme that so many fair young lady be so strict enclose as not to suffer man to visit they in the academy faith if the man shall be admit into their academy there will be work enough for the grave matron be it but to act the part of midwife lady at this time let the theme of your discourse be of discourse as for discourse it be different various some discourse be delightful and please other tedious and troublesome some rude and uncivil some vain and unnecessary some graceful and acceptable some wise and profitable but in most discourse time be lose have nothing that be worthy to be learn practise or observe but there be two sort of discourse or manner of way of discourse as there be a discourse within the mind and a discourse with word as for the inward discourse in the mind it be to discourse to a man self as if they be discourse to other make question or proposition syllogism and conclusion to himself wherein a man may deceive himself with his own false argument for it be a old say that it be one thing to oppose himself and another thing to be oppose by other and it be easy to argue without opposition as for discourse with word it be more difficult than to discourse with thought for though word be as high and substantial as thought yet the mouth be not so ready in speak as the brain in think and the brain can present more thought at one time than the mouth can deliver word at one time but word or rhetoric be apt to deceive a man as his conception especial orator which draw themselves with the force of rhetoric from the right and the truth so as a orator be as apt to delude himself as to delude his auditory if he make word or eloquence the ground of his question persuasion or judgement and not reason for reason must find out the truth and right and truth must judge the cause but rhetoric be for the most part a vizard to right reason for it seem a natural face and be not so rhetoric seem right reason but be not also there be extemporal discourse and discourse premeditate extemporal sound best to the ear of the hearer although of less wit than premeditate discourse because they be deliver more natural and so flow more free and easy which make the noise not only to sound more sweet but the discourse to be more delightful both to the ear and the mind of the hearer and more ready to the understanding but of all discourse the disputive discourse be harsh indeed all disputive discourse be like chromatic music wherein be more skill than harmony but all discourse shall be fit measure or choose to the time place person and occasion for that discourse which be proper for one time place or person be improper for another time place or person as a discourse of mirth in a time of sadness a familiar discourse from a inferior to a superior a vain discourse to a serious humour or a effeminate discourse to a man or a masculine discourse to a woman and many the like example may be give also there be discourse that be sensible discourse rational discourse and witty discourse also there be other discourse that have neither sense reason wit nor fancy in they also there be clownish discourse and courtly discourse also there be a general discourse and particular discourse also scholastical discourse and poetical discourse but of all the several way manner or sort of discourse and discourse let i commend the poetical discourse and discourse which be brief and quick full of variety curiosity and newness be as new as peep of day as refresh as the zephyrus wind as modest as the blush morning sweet as the flowery spring as pleasant as a summer evening as profitable as autumn harvest as splendorous as the midday sun as flow as the full tide sea as dilate as the spread air as fruitful as the fertile earth and have as great a influence upon the nature disposition and humour of man as the star and planet in the heaven have it take life from the celestial flame and be produce from the god on high and this discourse make man resemble to a deity whither so hasty i be go to hear they speak in the academy they have do for this time and do they speak well as they use to do why they never speak before there where why in the academy why i be sure i hear one lady speak yesterday and another today lady i mean the academy of man why do the man intend to speak yes present if they have not do speak already gentleman we need no learned scholar nor grave sage to propound the theme of our discourse in this place and at this time for our mind be so full of thought of the female sex as we have no room for any other subject or object wherefore let the theme be what it will our discourse will soon run on they but if we can bring woman as easy into our arm as into our brain and have we as many mistress in our possession as we have in our imagination we shall be much more happy than we be nay have we be blind deaf and insensible to the sex we have be happy unless that sex have be more kind than they be but they be cruel which make man miserable but nature have make beauty in vain if not for the use of the masculine sex wherefore nature forbid restraint and it be a sin against nature for woman to be encloister retire or restrain nay it be not only a sin against nature but a grievous sin against the god for woman to live single life or to vow virginity for if woman live virgin there will be no saint for heaven nor worship nor adoration offer to the god from earth for if all woman live virgin the race of mankind will be utter extinguish and if it be a general sin to live virgin no particular can be exempt and if it be lawful for one to live a virgin it be lawful for all so if it be unlawful for one it be unlawful for all but sure the god will not make any thing lawful that be against themselves but to conclude those woman which restrain themselves from the company and use of man be damn be accuse by man judge by nature and condemn by the god what say you will you go into the academy no faith i mean not to be damn i be of your mind i will run unto the man to save i so will i since the way of salvation be so easy and so pleasant lady let the theme of your discourse be at this time on the behaviour of our sex it be a great difficulty for a woman to behave herself discreet in private visitation than for a man to speak wise in privy counsel and it be a great difficulty for a woman to behave herself well in a public assembly than for a man to speak eloquent in a public auditory and it be a great difficulty for a woman to behave herself well to several person and in several assembly than for a man to behave himself gallant in several battle and as much dishonour come in the misbehaviour of the one as the cowardliness of the other wherefore there require as much skill care and conduct in a woman behaviour in visit entertain place apply and discourse as to a commander in muster train entrench besiege embattle fight and retreat for it be not enough for a woman to behave herself according to her degree quality dignity birth and breed age beauty wit and fortune but according to time place and occasion business and affair as also to the humour capacity profession dignity quality birth breed fortune age and sex of those person she be in company and conversation withal also in mix company she must have a mix behaviour and mix discourse as sometime to one then to another according as she can handsome and civil apply or address herself and to those that apply and address themselves to she for a woman must not behave herself or discourse unto a great lord or prince as to a peasant or to a peasant as to a great lord or prince nor to a soldier as to a divine nor to a divine as to a soldier nor to a statesman as to a tradesman nor to a tradesman as to a statesman nor to a flat gallant as to a grave senior nor to a grave senior as to a flat gallant nor to a young man as to a ancient man nor to a boy as to a man nor to a woman as to a man nor to a poet as to a woman or as to those man that understand not poetry nor to learned man as to ignorant man also a ancient grave matron must not behave herself like a wanton young girl nor a wife like a maid nor a widow like a wife nor a mother like her daughter nor a mistress like her servant nor a servant like a mistress nor a great lady like a country wise nor a country wife like a great lady for that will be ridiculous indeed it be easy for a middle rank or degree at least it be often see to behave themselves better than those of high title and great estate or those of a very mean condition and of low birth for the one be apt to err with excessive pride the other with a excessive rudeness both be bold and ignorant breed know not how to be civil nor what belong to civil person for the pride of the one scorn to be instruct and the poverty of the other have not mean to keep and pay instructer for the excess of plenty nuzzle the one in ignorance and excess of poverty blindfold the other from knowledge but to conclude of the behaviour of woman first as to the generality they must behave themselves civil and circumspect to particular modest and friendly for the chief principal of behaviour be twelve six good and six bad the six good be ceremony civility modesty humility friendship and obedience the first be majestic and magnificent the second noble the three virtuous the four humane the five generous the pious the first be graceful the second sociable the three delightful the four natural the five helpful the necessary the first belong to dignity the second to breed the three to youth the four to age the five to wealth the to peace as for the six bad principal be to be proud bold rude wanton disobedient and cruel the first be insolent the second impudent the three ignorant the four brutish the five unnatural the wicked the first live with mean birth join with good fortune the second life with ignorant and doltish spirit the three with base breed the four with beast the five with uncivil nation the with atheist the first be to be slight the second to be pity the three to be shun the four to be hate the five to be govern the to be punish what say you to these young lady i say that though they be but young lady they discourse like old woman the beauty of the female sex have as great a influence upon the eye of man as the star of the heaven have upon their nature and disposition but as a cloud of ill education cover change or bury the good influence of the star so a cloud of time cover change and bury the beauty of the fair lady face which altar the affection of man and bury all the delight that be receive therefrom in the ruin of age and the grave of wrinkle but beauty whilst it be fresh and flourish it be the most powerful conqueress and triumph in the chariot of youth and though her masculine subject forsake she when time have displace she and weaken her power yet she be unwise not to take pleasure in her victory whilst she may come come neighbour we shall get no room to see and hear the young lady if we go not quick yes let we go but stay neighbour i must run home again for i have leave the key in the cellar door let it be there for this time by my truth i must not for my maid joan and the apprentice will drink out all my ale and strong beer and there will be none leave to give my husband a draught when he go to bed what neighbour be you come back already why there be no get in the doorkeeper beat i back and say there be no room for citizen wife for the room be only keep for lady and gentlewoman of quality well we may come to be lady one day although not gentlewoman and then we shall not so often be beat back let we go to the gentleman side they will receive we and use we kind lady let the theme of our discourse at this time be of truth truth although she have but one face which be a natural face yet she have many several countenance for sometime her countenance be severe other time kind and familiar sometime it be sad sometime merry other time please and delightful also she have as different humour as she have countenance according to the cause or occasion likewise her presence or approach show the different effect and several cause or from one cause on several object or subject as for example sometime her approach show man to be miserable or happy as when she come to inform he of good fortune or bad or when she present he with right understanding of the condition he be in but in truth in whatsoever countenance or humour she put on she be a most beautiful lady for although she do not shine as the sun which dazzle and obscure the sight with his splendorous beam yet she do appear like a bright clear day wherein and whereby all thing be see perfect and although she have various humour yet her action be just for the alteration of her countenance and humour be not to deceive man nor she take no delight in her own sad approach to grieve man but she do bear apart both of their grief and joy she make neither the chance fortune accident nor action but only declare they she be neither the cause nor effect but only show the several effect of cause or what cause those effect she be of a sweet nature and a humble disposition she do as free and common accompany the poor as the rich the mean as the great indeed her constant habitation and dwelling be among the learned and industrious man but she have a opposite or rival namely falsehood which often obscure she and be often prefer before she this falsehood her rival be of the nature of a courtesan as all courtesan be as to flat and insinuate herself and company to all man good like and good opinion she be full of deceit and dissemble and although she hate truth yet she imitate she as much as she can i do not say she imitate the justice severity and plainness of truth for those of all thing or action she shun but she imitate her behaviour and countenance for although falsehood be foul and filthy of herself yet by artificial paint she make herself appear as fair and pure as truth but the deserve wife can soon see the difference between the artificial fair of falsehood and the true natural fair complexion of truth although fool do admire and be soon catch so for the most part deceive with the deceive article of falsehood than the natural verity of truth for falsehood make a glare show at the first sight but the more she be view the worse she appear whereas truth the more she be view the better she appear also falsehood use rhetoric to allure and deceive with her eloquent tongue whereas truth speak little herself but bring always and at all time and in all place and to all thing right reason and plain proof to speak for she who speak without flourish phrase or deck sentence or scholastical rule method or tense but speak to the purpose deliver the matter brief and keep to the sense of truth or true sense which be both the best and natural way of speak and the honest practice of truth whereas eloquence be one of the most cozen and abuse article as be for as paint be a vizard on the face so be eloquence a vizard on the mind and the tongue be the pencil of deceit draw the picture of discourse thus falsehood strive to resemble truth as much as artificial she can

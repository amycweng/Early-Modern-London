be capable to have as much wit or wisdom as man first i must define what wit and wisdom be as for wit it be the daughter of nature and wisdom be a son of the god this daughter of nature the lady wit be very beautiful and for the most part her countenance be very amiable and her speech delightful in her accoutrement she be as all other of the female sex be various as sometime in plain garment and sometime in glitter garment and sometime she be attire in garment of as many several colour as the rainbow and she altar in their fashion as often as in their substance or trim as for her humour it be according to the nature of her sex which be as various and change as her accoutrement for that sometime she be merry and jest other time please and delightful sometime melancholy sometime fantastical other time spiteful and censorious and oft time wild and wanton unless discretion rule and lead she who keep she within the bound and pale of modesty also her discourse be various as sometime she will

very beautiful lady namely the nine muse and every several muse partake of every several humour of the mother these nine beautiful lady nature grandchild and wit daughter have vow single life live always in the court with their mother who court be a very glorious palace for it be compose of celestial flame and divine spirit be the architecture thereof the servant and courtier of the lady wit be poet man of all nation quality dignity and humour these courtier the poet make love to the lady wit daughter the nine muse and often receive favour from they which favour their servant the poet braid they into rhyme and make several work of verse then tie they into true lover knot and then as all lover use to do with their mistress favour vainglorious show they to the public view of the world for though the lady muse will not marry yet they receive courtly address and take delight to be woo and sue to the young sort of poet be amorous lover the grave and more ancient poet be platonic lover and some be divine lover and some be heroic lover and some be satirical lover which woo in a crabbed style but to conclude of wit there be good wit which have foolish judgement for though wit and wisdom be sister and brother both the child of nature yet for the most part the brother be a mere fool and the sister have a great wit but some have masculine wit and effeminate judgement as if their beam be the next i be to define be wisdom who as i say be a son of the god this wisdom be a person of perfect and upright shape of well composed feature of a manly garb and a assure countenance in his speech he be of a ready delivery and he have a well tempered humour as for the accoutrement of his person he change they according to the time and occasion his constant habitation be in the strong tower of honesty this tower be build round without end or corner or by place and it stand upon four pillar as prudence fortitude justice and temperance upon every several pillar be letter engrave wherein may be read the proper use benefit and advantage of each pillar these pillar of support cause this tower to be impregnable for though there be many assault make against it as by riches which shoot his golden bullet out of his golden canon at it strive to batter it down and power bring a mighty army to assault it and danger of death strive to storm it and flattery and insinuation to undermine it yet it hold out without any breach therein for the wall of this tower name honesty be of a wonderful strength for they be as durable as a entire diamond not to be dissolve and as transparent as a crystal without the least spot stain or blemish in this tower as i say live wisdom a most magnificent lord he be and be attend numerous and noble he chief favourite be truth his chief counsellor be reason understanding observation experience and judgement his chief officer be patience industry and opportunity his domestic servant be the appetite which servant he rule and govern with great moderation his nobility be the passion which he prefer according to their merit but those that be apt to be factious he severe punish for he be one that love peace and hate brawlery or any dissension he be a person of the quick sense for he have a most pierce sight to foresee danger as to avoid they and can well distinguish the right way from the wrong likewise he have a most clear hear for nothing pass by that concern he but the sound give he a alarm to stand upon his guard or a charge to take his advantage but he have a silent tongue for he never speak but it be to some purpose also he have a marvelous quick scent to smell out a rebellion or treason and he will follow it pace by pace as hound do hare and never leave till he have hunt it out also his touch be very sensible he soon feel a courtesy or injury the first he receive grateful and feel tender the other he receive strong and gripe hard when he can take fast hold otherwise he let it pass or fall as if his touch be numb he be a person which be so solicit by the weak seek to by the wrong flat by the ambitious sue to by the distress and he often fit in the court of error to rectify the disorder therein sometime he have be in great human counsel but that be very rare indeed he be so seldom in great human counsel as he be hardly know for not one among a thousand that do ever see he much less to have any acquaintance with he for he be reserve and not company for every one but there be many that false pretend not only to be acquaint with he but get fall visard and pretend to be wisdom itself and the world for the most part be cozen and abuse with these cheat in not know the right and true wisdom and how shall they when wisdom itself appear so seldom as he be a stranger even in king court and prince palace and so great a stranger he be in many court and counsel that if by chance he shall be there they thrust he out as a troublesome guest and laugh at his advice as foolish or condemn his counsel as treacherous but now i have declare unto you who wit and wisdom be now i be to give my opinion whether woman be capable of their society but true i must tell you it be a difficult question by reason the several education which be the usher that lead human creature to several society for there be society of the ignorant and foolish as well as of the witty and wise and several usher belong thereto and indeed these latter society be numerous and of all sort the other be society of the most choice for though wit be not a absolute goddess nor human wisdom a absolute god yet they be a degree above other earthly mortal but fool be produce from the degree of mortality and ignorance be the daughter of obscurity the usher of these be obstinacy stupidity and illiterature which lead mortal to dangerous and inaccessible way in this last society for the most part woman be of as be breed therein and have such ill tutor and guide they must needs err for there be a old say when the blind lead the blind they must needs fall into the ditch nor have sight to choose their way so woman breed up woman the generation must needs be fool for the first woman have a ill tutor the devil which neither instruct she in the knowledge of wisdom nor wit but learn her hurtful dissimulation to which she have breed all her female generation successive as from female to female but your question be whether woman be capable of wit and wisdom true in my opinion woman be more capable of wit than wisdom by reason they be both of the female gender which may cause some sympathy in their nature and in some thing they do plain sympathy and agree for wit be wild and various and so be woman and wit be busy and meddle with every thing cause or subject so do woman wit be fantastical and so be woman wit be always in extreme and so be woman wit do talk much and so do woman wit be humoursome and so be woman wit be prodigal and so be woman wit love praise and so do woman wit do sport and play dance and sing the time away and so do woman wit be many time wanton and so be woman thus far be woman capable of the society and conversation of wit but i doubt of her subtle invention quick apprehension rare conception elevate fancy and smooth elocution as for wisdom woman seem to all outward appearance to have a natural antipathy abhor his severe and strict rule hate his medicinable admonition his profitable counsel and advice his wary way his prudent forecast his serious action his temperate life and sober disposition all which make they uncapable of the society of wisdom

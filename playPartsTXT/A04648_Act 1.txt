get hence and tell thy vex spirit wealth in this age will scarce look on merit who bring this same sir ha marry sir one of the justice man he say it be a precept and all their hand be at it ay and the print of they stick in my flesh deep than in their letter they have send i pill wrap in paper here that shall i take they will poison all the sweetness of my book and turn my honey into hemlock juice but i be wise than to serve their precept or follow their prescription here be a device to charge i bring my grain unto the market ay much when i have neither barn nor garner nor earth to hide it in i will bring it but till then each corn i send shall be as big as paul o but say some the poor be like to starve why let they starve what be that to i be bee bind to keep life in drone and idle moth no why such be these that term themselves the poor only because they will be pity but be indeed a sort of lazy beggar licentious rogue and sturdy vagabond breed by the sloth of a fat plenteous year like serpent in heat of summer out of dung and this be all that these cheap time be good for whereas a wholesome and penurious dearth purge the soil of such vile excrement and kill the viper up o but master take heed they hear you not why so they will exclaim against you ay their exclaim move i as much as thy breath move a mountain poor worm they hiss at i whilst i at home can be content to applaud myself to sit and clap my hand and laugh and leap knock my head against my roof with joy to see how plump my bag be and my barn sirrah go hie you home and bid your fellow get all their flail ready again i come i will sir i will instant set all my hind to thrash of a whole reek of corn which i will hide under the ground and with the straw thereof i will stuff the outside of my other mow that do i will have they empty all my garner and in the friendly earth bury my store that when the searcher come they may suppose all be spend and that my fortune be belie and to lend more opinion to my want and stop that many mouthed vulgar dog which else will still be bay at my door each market day i will be see to buy part of the pure wheat as for my household where when it come it shall increase my heap it will yield i treble gain at this dear time promise in this dear book i have cast all till then i will not sell a care i will hang first o i shall make my prize as i list my house and i can feed on pease and barley what though a world of wretch starve the while he that will thrive must think no course vile now signor how approve you this have the humorist express themselves true or no yes if it be well prosecute it be hitherto happy enough but methinks macilente go hence too soon he may have be make to stay and speak somewhat in reproof of sordido wretchedness now at the last o no that have be extreme improper beside he have continue the scene too long with he as it be be in no more action you may enforce the length as a necessary reason but for propriety the scene will very well have bear it in my judgement o worst of both why you mistake his humour utter then how do i mistake it be it not envy yes but you must understand signor he envy he not as he be a villain a wolf in the commonwealth but as he be rich and fortunate for the true condition of envy be dolour to have our eye continual fix upon another man prosperity that be his chief happiness and to grieve at that where as if we make his monstrous and abhor action our object the grief we take then come near the nature of hate than envy as be breed out of a kind of contempt and loathe in ourselves so you will infer it have be hate not envy in he to reprehend the humour of sordido right for what a man true envy in another he can always love and cherish in himself but no man true reprehend in another what he love in himself therefore reprehension be out of his hate and this distinction have he himself make in a speech there if you mark it where he say i envy not this buffoon but i hate he stay sir i envy not this buffoon but i hate he why may he not as well have hate sordido as he no sir there be subject for his envy in sordido his wealth so be there not in the other he stand possess of no one eminent gift but a most odious and fiend like disposition that will turn charity itself into hate much more envy for the present

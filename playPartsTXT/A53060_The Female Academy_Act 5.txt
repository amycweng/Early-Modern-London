this be not to be suffer for if we shall let these lady rest in peace and quiet in their enclose habitation we shall have none but old woman for all those young lady that be not in the academy talk of nothing but of go into a female academy you say true insomuch as it begin to be a mode and a fashion for all the young fair rich and noble lady to enclose themselves into a academy nay we must seek some way and devise some mean to unroost they there be nothing can do it but noise for they take such pleasure in the exercise of their tongue that unless we can put they to silence there be no hope to get they out trumpet i doubt will not be loud enough let we try content content etc lady let the theme of your discourse be at this time of boldness and bashfulness there be three sort of boldness or confidence the one proceed from custom or practice as it may be observe by preacher pleader and player that can present themselves speak and act free in a public assembly the second sort of boldness or confidence proceed from ignorance not foresee what error or folly may be commit or chance to fall out or what be fit to be do or say like as poor mean country people who have neither birth nor breed have so much confidence as they can more confident present themselves or presence to those of noble birth and breed and can more free and bold talk to any person or person of what quality or dignity soever than those noble person can talk to they the three and last sort of confidence or boldness proceed from a extraordinary opinionatedness or self conceitedness for those that think or believe themselves to be above other in wit person part or power although they have neither will be most haughty and proud confident scorn and undervalue all other as inferior thus bold confidence or confident boldness be produce from practice ignorance and pride also there be three sort of bashfulness the one proceed from too great a apprehension the other from a poetical fiction the three from a aspire ambition first from too groat a apprehension as some be afraid that their observer or friend shall make a evil construction of their good intention other will be bashful and out of countenance upon a poetical fiction as imagine of some impossible or at least some improbable accident which may fall out to their disgrace the three and last be through a aspire ambition desire to outact all other in excellency and fear to fail therein be apt to be out of countenance as if they have receive a foil thus we may perceive that the stream of good nature the pierce beam of wit and the throne of noble ambition be the true cause of bashfulness i mean not shamefacedness but sweet bashfulness but although bashfulness be a sweet tender noble and pierce effect of and from the soul yet bashfulness be apt to unstring the nerve to weaken the sinew to dull the sense to quench the spirit to blunt the eye or point of wit and to obstruct the speech insomuch as to cause the word to run stumble out of the mouth or to suffer none to pass forth but a little anger in the mind will take off the extreme bashfulness of the behaviour although much anger do obstruct the sense spirit and speech as much as extreme bashfulness do for extreme anger and extreme bashfulness have often one and the same effect to outward appearance the gentleman will turn trumpeter for a regiment of gentleman have buy every one of they a trumpet to sound a march to the academy of lady faith if the lady will answer their trumpet with blow of horn they will serve they but as they ought to be serve woman will soon make horn than blow horn lady let the theme of your discourse at this time be of virtuous courtship and woo suitor some poetical and romantical writer make valiant gallant heroic woo poor sneak and peddle lady let i interrupt you will you have gallant heroic in their courtship to fair young lady as command as in the field or as furious as in a battle no i will have they woo with a confident behaviour a noble demeanour a generous civility and not to be amaze or to tremble for fear to weep for pity to kneel for mercy to sigh and be deject with a mistress frown for though sorrow sigh tear and humility become all heroic spirit very well and express a noble and generous soul yet not in such a cause for tear become all heroic spirit for the death or torment of friend or for the sufferance of innocent or virtue yet not if only themselves be torment or to die or for any misfortune that can come upon our own person or estate or for any obstruction to their own pleasure or delight but it become all heroic spirit to tremble for fear of their honour or loss of their fame and express a generous soul to grieve and to mourn in a general calamity and to humble themselves to the god for those in distress and to implore and kneel to they for mercy both for themselves and other as for to divert the wrath of the god but not to weep sigh tremble kneel pray for their effeminate pleasure delight or society nor to grieve or sorrow for the loss of the same also some writer when they be to describe a bashful and modest lady such as be noble and honourable breed describe they as if they be simple shamefaced which description make such appear as if they come mere from the milk bowl and have be breed only with silly huswife and that their practice be to pick worm from root of flower and their pastime to carry and fling crumb of bread to bird or little chicken that be hatch by their hen their mother give they or to gather a lapful of sweet flower to distil a little sweet water to dip their handkerchief in or to wash their face in a little rose water and indeed this harmless and innocent breed may be modest and bashful or rather shamefaced for want of other conversation which custom and company will soon cast off or wear out and then print boldness on their brow but true modest soul which have for the most part bashful countenance proceed from a deep apprehension a clear understanding a ingenuous wit a think brain a pure mind a refine spirit a noble education and not from a ignorant obscure breed for it be not ignorance that make modesty but knowledge nor be it guiltiness that make bashfulness but fear of those that be guilty but as i say many writer that will make a description of modest and bashful woman mistake and express a shamefaced ignorance and obscure breed and instead of express a young lady to be innocent of fault they express she to be one that be ignorant of knowledge so as when they will describe a modest bashful innocent virgin they mistake and describe a simple ignorant shame face maid that either want breed or capacity but lady let i ask you one question will you have a young virgin as confident and know as a marry wife yes although not in their behaviour or condition of life but in her virtue and constancy for a chaste marry wife be as modest and bashful as a virgin though not so simple ignorant and shamefaced as a plain breed maid but as i say writer shall describe the woo of gallant heroic or great and noble person to woo with a generous confidence or manly garb a civil demeanour a rational discourse to a honest design and to a virtuous end and not with a whine voice in pitiful word and fawn language and if it be only for a mistress as for a courtesan bribe be the best advocate or to employ other to treat with they and not to be the pimp although for themselves also writer shall when they describe noble virgin to receive noble address of love and to receive those noble address or courtship with a attentive modesty in a bashful countenance and if to tremble for fear to describe the fear as be the nature of the sex also to describe their behaviour after a noble garb and their answer to their suitor to be full of reason sense and truth and those answer to be deliver in as short discourse and as few word as civility will allow of and not like a ignorant innocent a childish simplicity a unbred behaviour express themselves or answer their suitor with mince word that have neither sense nor reason in they also poetical and romantical writer shall not make great prince that have be breed in great and populous city glorious camp and splendorous court to woo and make love like private breed man or like rude breed clown or like mean breed servant or like scholar that woo by the book in scholastical term or phrase or to woo like flaunt rant swear brag swaggerer or rusters or to woo a country wench like as a noble lady or great princess also not to make such woman as have be breed and bear noble and honourable to receive the courtship of great person like a dairy maid kitchenmaid or like such as have be breed in mean cottage as to behave themselves simple or rude as to the answer and speak cross or thwart as contradict every word that be speak unto they as if they do believe what they say be not truth for civil and honourable breed woman who have noble and generous soul will rather seem to believe all their superlative praise than make doubt as if they know they lie for to make doubt be in the midway to give the lie lady how approve you of those lover that kiss the letter token pledge and the like that be send unto they from their lover or such as wear letter token or pledge in their bosom and next their heart and take they and view they a hundred time a day approve it say you you mean disapprove it but let i tell you most reverend matron that the very hear of it make the sick and the see of it will make i die i have so great a aversion against such action for those action like as whine speech proceed from filthy amorous love and mean lover for true love in noble person receive gift as a expression of their suitor or lover love and will careful keep they as a acknowledgement of the receipt and accept of they as a great seal to their affection yet they keep such present but as treasurer not as owner until they be man and wife neither do they make idol of such gift nor do they adore the owner the more for the gift nor the gist for the owner nor do they think fit they ought to give such outward expression of love by such useless action whenas they have a high esteem of their suitor love a perfect belief of their merit and a constant return of their affection and a resolution to die or suffer any misery for their sake if need require beside true lover have ever the idea of their beloved in their thought by which they can forget their memory indeed love letter they may read often because letter be a enjoyment of their discourse although their person be at a distance and be also a recreation and delight in their wit if there be any wit therein but to kiss the paper they neither find pleasure delight profit neither to themselves nor to their beloved the truth be not one writer among a thousand make lover woo either wise witty noble eloquent or natural but either foolish mean unmanly unhandsome or amorous which be corrupt lady you say very true and some romantical writer make long and tedious oration or long and tedious and fruitless discourse in such time as require sudden action you say right as to speak when they be to fight but for my part i hate to read romance or some scene in play who ground or foundation be amorous love when you read such book you must never consider the subject that the writer write on but consider the wit language fancy or description most reverend sister i suppose few read romance or the like book but for the wit fancy judgement and lively description for they do not read such book as they do read chronicle wherein be only to be consider the true relation of the history most grave and wife matroness i believe though none read romance or such like book who ground be feign love and lover as they read chronicle who ground shall be unfeigned truth yet certain few read romance or the like book either for the wit fancy judgement or description but to feed their amorous humour on their amorous discourse and to tune their voice to their amorous strain of amorous love for it be to be observe that those book that be most amorous pen be most often read may it please your worship there be a ancient gentlewoman that desire to speak with your worship i lay my life it be one of the matron of the academy faith if the humble bee be fly out the rest of the bee will follow i fear if they do they will swarm about our ear yes and sting we with their tongue let we send for she in i will go and usher she in gentleman the lady of the academy have send i unto you to know the reason or cause that you will not let they rest in quiet or suffer they to live in peace but disturb they in both by a confuse noise of trumpet which you uncivil and discourteous blow at their grate and gate the cause be that they will not permit we to come into their company but have barricado their gate against we and have encloister themselves from we beside it be a dangerous example for all the rest of their sex for if all woman shall take a toy in their head to encloister themselves there will be none leave out to breed on surely it be very fit and proper that young virgin shall live a retire life both for their education and reputation as for their education it be but to learn to talk and woman can do that without teach for on my conscience a woman be the first inventor of speech and as for their retirement nature do never make they for that purpose but to associate themselves with man and since man be the chief head of their kind it be a sign they have but very little brain if they will suffer the young and fair woman to encloister themselves gentleman pray give i leave to inform you for i perceive you be in great error of mistake for these lady have not vow virginity or be they encloister for a academy be not a cloister but a school wherein be teach how to be good wife when they be marry but no man can come to woo they to be wife no but if they can win their parent or those they be leave in trust with and get their good like and consent the young lady have learn so much duty and obedience as to obey to what they shall think fit but we desire the lady good like we care not for their friend for the approvement and good like of their friend without the love of the lady will not make we happy for there be no satisfaction in a secondary love as to be beloved for another sake and not for their own if you be worthy gentleman as i believe you all be their love will be due to your merit and your merit will persuade they to love you well if you will be our mediator we will surcease our clamour otherwise we will increase our noise if you can get leave of their parent and friend i will endeavour to serve you and shall be proud of the employment that you shall be please to impose to my trust and management and we shall be your servant for your favour

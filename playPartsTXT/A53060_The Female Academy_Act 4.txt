methinks the woman lectural discourse be better than the man for in my opinion the man discourse be simple childish and foolish in comparison of the woman why the subject of the discourse be of woman which be simple foolish and childish there be no sign of their simplicity or folly in their discourse or speech i know not what may be in their action now you come to the point for the weakness of woman lie in their action not in their word for they have sharp wit and blunt judgement lady let the theme of your discourse today be of a theatre a theatre be a public place for public action oration disputation presentation whereunto be a public resort but there be only two theatre which be the chief and the most frequent the one be of war the other of peace the theatre of war be the field and the battle they sight be the play they act and the soldier be the tragedian and the theatre of peace be the stage and the play there act be the humour manner disposition nature custom of man thereon describe and act whereby the theatre be as school to teach youth good principle and instruct they in the nature and custom of the world and mankind and learn man to know themselves better than by any other way of instruction and upon these theatre they may learn what be noble and good what base and wicked what be ridiculous and misbecome what graceful and best become what to avoid and what to imitate the genius that belong to the theatre of war be valour and the genius that belong to the theatre of peace be wit the designer of the rough play of war be a general or council the designer of the smooth play of peace be a poet or a chief magistrate but the difference of these play act on each theatre be the one be real the other feign the one in earnest the other in jest for a poet only feign tragedy but the soldier do true act tragedy on the poetical theatre i will only insist for this theatre belong more to our person and be a more fit subject for the discourse of our sex than war be for we delight more in scene than in battle i will begin first with poet who be the author and maker of these kind of play fame have speak loud both of ancient and modern poet as for the ancient poet they be a length out of the reach of my judgement so as my opinion will hardly reach so far but as for our modern poet that have make play in our modern time although they deserve praise yet not so much nor so high applause as be give they for most of their plot or foundation of their play be take out of old author as from the greek and roman historian and poet also all the modern romance be take out of these story and many play out of these romance lady give i leave a little while to instruct you as to tell you that all romance shall be so for the ground of a right romance be a true story only falsehood be intermix therein so that a romance be a compound of truth and falsehood give i leave to answer you that in my opinion a right romance be poetical fiction put into a historical style but for play the true comedy be pure love and humour also the custom manner and the habit and inbred quality of mankind and right tragicomedy be the description of the passion which be create in the soul and a right tragedy be intermix with the passion appetite and humour of man with the influence of outward action accident and misfortune but as i say some poet take the plot out of true history other out of feign history which be romance so as their plot for the most part be mere translation and oft time the wit be also but a translate wit only metamorphose after their own way but the truth be that some of they their wit be their own and their plot be steal or plain take and some their plot be their own but the wit steal but of all theft wit be never confess and some neither the plot nor wit be their own and other both plot and wit be true their own these last poet although but very few be the true son of nature the other but as adulterate issue but for the most part our modern play both plot and wit be mere translation and yet come out as bold upon the stage as if the translator be the original author think or at least hope that the alteration of the language conceal the theft which to the unlearned it do but the learned soon find they out and see all their body wing leg tail and feather although they hide their head in the bush of ignorance i speak not in discommendation of these translation nor translator for translation be so far from be condemn as they ought to be much nay very much commend and high praise if it be such as be praise worthy for old author may in some expression be more profitable and good both for wit and example than the modern and the translator may be commend both for their judgement and learning beside very good translator must have a sympathetical genius with the original author but their condemnation proceed from the translator unjust own of it upon themselves or in translate it to the author prejudice lady let i interrupt you once again to ask your opinion how you like the italian and french play as well as i can like any thing that be a strain beyond nature or as i may say nature constraint for the truth be in their discourse or rehearsal they do not only raise their voice a note or two too high but many note too high and in their action they be so force as the spectator may very easy believe the actor will break their sinew string and in their speech they fetch their breath so short and thick and in such painful fetch and throw as those spectator that be stranger may very believe that they be gasp for life but lady all know love which be the theme or subject of play be a violent passion which force the player to a elevation of action and speech most reverend matron my opinion be that though it be commendable and admirable for the poet to be elevate with a poetical divine inspiration to outdo nature yet for the actor their best grace be to play or act in the tract or path of nature and to keep within nature bound and whensoever they go awry or transgress therefrom they be to be condemn and to be account ill actor and as for the passion of love certain the strong love be like the deep water which be most silent and least unnecessary active they may sometime murmur with wind of sigh but never roar they neither foam nor froth with violence but be compose into a heavy body with a settle sadness but in short the italian and french player act more romantical than natural which be feign and constrain but to conclude with the poet he delight the ear and the understanding with the variety of every thing that nature have make or be invent for a poet be like a bee that gather the sweet of every flower and bring the honey to his hive which be the ear and memory of the hearer or reader in who head his wit swarm but as painter draw to the life so poet shall write to the life and player act to the life the academy of lady take no notice of the academy of man nor seem to consider what the man say for they go on their own serious way and edify discourse at which the man be so angry as they have swear to leave off talk and instead thereof they will sound trumpet so loud when the lady be in their discourse as they shall not hear themselves speak by which mean they hope to draw they out of their cloister as they swarm bee for as bee gather together at the sound of a basin kettle or such like mettle thing so they will disperse that swarm of academical lady with the sound of brazen trumpet why the lady look through their grate upon the man whilst the man be speak and seem to listen to what they speak as the man do on and to the lady that be true but they take no notice of they in their literal discourse as what the man have say for they neither mention the man nor their discourse or argument or academy as if there be no such man lady let the theme of your discourse be at this time of vanity vice and wickedness there be a difference between vanity vice and wickedness wickedness be in the will vice in the desire and vanity in the action will proceed from the soul vice from the appetite and action from custom or practice the soul be produce from the god the appetite create by nature and custom be derive from time as for desire we may desire and not will and we may will and not act and we may act and neither will nor desire and we may desire will and act all at once and to some particular we may neither desire will nor act but the will make vice wickedness and vanity vice the willing of good proceed from the god the willing of evil proceed from the devil so that sin be to will evil in despite of good and piety be to will good in despite of evil as neither the persuasion nor temptation of the one or the other shall draw our will for sin or wickedness be neither in the knowledge nor appetite for if our great grandmother eve have not willfull eat of that which be strict forbid she she have not sin for if that she have only hear of the effect of that fruit or have desire it yet have not willfull eat thereof she have never damn her posterity thus to will against the god command be wickedness but there be no such thing as wickedness in nature but as i say wickedness proceed from the soul vice from the appetite and vanity from the action as for wickedness it be like a dead palsy it have no sense or feel of the grace or goodness of the god and vice be like a unwholesome meat cut out by the appetite for the appetite be like knife whereas some be blunt other be sharp and as it be too much edge but they be either blunt of sharp according as nature whet they but if they be very sharp as to be keen they wind the body and make the life bleed as for vanity it be as the froth of life it be light and swim atop which bubble out into extravagant and unprofitable action false opinion and idle and impossible imagination but as i say it be not the knowledge of vanity vice and wickedness that make a creature guilty thereof but the will and willfull practice thereof for wickedness vice and vanity must be know as much as piety virtue and discretion otherwise man may run into evil through ignorance wherefore it be as great a shame to education not to be instruct in the bad as it be a glory to be instruct in the good but the question will be whether knowledge can be without a partake thereof i answer not a perfect knowledge but a suppositive knowledge for there be many thing which can be perfect know but suppositive know so we must only know wickedness vice and vanity as we do know the god and devil which be by a lively faith so as we must be instruct in all that be pious virtuous and judicious as we be instruct of the power and goodness of the god and we must be instruct in all that be wicked vicious and idle as we be of the evil and power of the devil now i must inform you that there be three sort of knowledge as a knowledge of possession a knowledge of action and a knowledge of declaration the knowledge of action lie in the appetite the knowledge of declaration lie in the sense the knowledge of possession in the will action and declaration as for example we may hear and see drunkenness adultery murder theft and the like and have no appetite to the same action also we may have a appetite to the same action yet not a will to act the same but if we have a desire and will act the same we have and be possess with the most perfect knowledge thereof but this last knowledge be utter unlawful in thing that be evil but not in thing that be good but to conclude we must be instruct by a narrative way and by the intelligence of our ear and eye in that which be evil as well and as plain as in thing that be good not to be ignorant in any thing that can be declare unto we not stay until we be old but to be thus instruct whilst we be young for many that be young novice commit many evil through ignorance not be instruct and inform plain and clear but dark and obscure cause by their foolish cautionary formal tutor or educator who hold that erroneous opinion that youth ought not to know such or such thing or act which if they have know evil may have be prevent and not leave until their evil be know by practice so that more evil be rather know by practice than declaration or instruction of information but if our sense be a guide to our reason and our reason a guide to our understanding and that the reason and understanding govern our appetite then it be probable our sense reason and understanding may govern our will

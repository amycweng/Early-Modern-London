come hether ho let vs sit downe a little in the shade vnder this tree in the coole aire i vvill sit vpon this blocke and i ouer against thee antonie where wilt thou sit peter i i will set my selfe vpon this stone sit away from thence you let me that i cannot behold the passers by i see a ship which sayleth toward vs tis a caracke of two thousand tuns see you the little boye vvith a flagge in his hand if he fall into the sea he will be drownd no i warrant you for he can swim o how he slides downe the tackling the mast of this ship is very great and thicke i thinke it grew at the vvest indies how canst thou tell hast thou bene in india vvith the spaniards as if one can know nothing of a countrie if he haue not bene there i discerne powles from hence there are me thinks some pigeons vpon the top of the steeple they be men fond and foolish boy but they seeme to them that see them so far off to be crowes or rather lacke dawes harke some body sounds a trumpet on the steeple vvhat an asse is that he sounds a point of vvar for the mistresses of london o vvhat fine vvether here is tis pleasant being among these greene fields geue eare to that larke vvhich singeth o how she mounteth on high vp to the clowds i remember now bartasius the french poet vvho vvrot these foure most excellent verses of her note the pretie larke mans angrie mood doth charme with melodie her tee ree lee ree tee ree lee ree chippring in the skie vp to the court of loue sweet bird mouting with flickering wings and downe againe my ioue adieu sweet ioue adieu she sings o how this little pretie chippering larke quauereth hir voice where article thou linus most harmonious musition with thine yuorie lute vvhere article thou amphio the finest fingrer of an harpe in all greece where article thou orpheus with thy siluer sitterne where article thou arion with thy melody that made the fish danse in the sea come hether learne new lessons truly these foure who haue bene so famous by report of all latine and greeke authours for that they were most excellent musitions haue neuer bene able to counterfait this little bird singing hir note harke harke tis some other bird that sings now tis a blacke bird or a nightingale the nightingale sings not but euening and morning where is she i pray thee tis a nightingale i heard her record seest thou not hir sitting on a sprig o how sweetly she sings without any stop and ceaseth not we must not maruell though she sing sweetly for that she is of athens vvhere the vvaues of the sea flote also against the shores by measure plinie vvriteth that she singeth before man longer and more sweetly a great deale what is the reason thereof i vvill tell it thee the cookow and the nightingale sing at one season of the yeare to vvit in the spring time from the middest of aprill to the end of may or thereabout these two birds contended about the sweetnesse of their song they seeke a iudge and bicause their dispute was of notes there was found fit to iudge this controuersie the asse vvho hath aboue all other beast his eares long the asse hauing put backe the nightingale vvhose musicke he sayd he did not vnderstand iudged the victorie to the cookow the nightingale appealed before man vvhom vvhen she saw she pleadeth her cause and singeth sweetly to make her cause good and to be reuenged of the vvrong that the asse had offered her i heare now a thing worthy of a poets vaine what then didst thou looke for something smelling of a philosophers braine seeke that of these new magistri inertes of the vniuersitie many of them are philosophers in their gownes and by their wits country clownes say then that they are doctors of valentia vvith long gownes and little scientia but harken me yet our nightingale i will tell thee something of the song of the nightingale translated out of a good author what man in the world sayth he is so gros headed so dull spirited so blockish or doltish that is not astonished and rauished with an vnspeakeable delight hearing the melodie of the nightingale how such a shrill harmonious voice may issue out of so smal a trunke beside that he perseuereth so earnestly in his song that his life shall so soone faile him as his voice so that it seemeth that he hath bene taught by some maister musition to sing his prick song for one while he faineth the base another while he quauereth the contretenour by and by he counterfeiteth the meane anon he sings the treble and being wearie with recording changeth quickly his note that you would gesse him to be some other bird that singeth but the plaine song then suddainly he chaunteth such shrill notes that he astonieth himselfe and remaineth as it were in a sweet traunce charmed by an infinitie of his melodious passages which rauish the spirits vp to the heauens not onely of men but also of other little fine birds whom he inchanteth and taketh prisoners there by his voice and maketh them through his sweet note to harken to him and to steale away a lesson or two of his musicke and not content with this you shall see hir instruct her yoong ones entising them to imitate her note to keepe tune with her to make the same stops to quauer in length one while to run vpon crochets by by to take a new tune by fainings then to descant and semiquauer it with courbed minims quickly trembleth her voice  and transformeth it into so many sorts of musicall points that no artifice of man can tell how to counterfait her note i am almost rauished truly without doubt man haue learned musicke of birdes democritus vvas the nightingales scholler witnesse aristophanes in his comedie of the song of birdes i haue caught a grasse hopper in one hand and a litle frog in the other let me see them i pray thee i will put them into thy bosome anthony do not i pray thee why runnest thou away come hether i will do thee no harme alas the poore prisoners let them go let them leape looke vvhat a fine skip there is the poore beast haue saued themselues in the grasse this banke is full of pisse mires they sting me by the buttockes they got in at my codpeece i haue more then a thousand in my breeches do you feele thm sting in good faith i haue puld off the heads of more then twentie kill them not let them liue tis a pretti kind of vermine you haue troubled the lord of their parlement which are assembled in this hillocke for the affaires of their common wealth they are angry with you they will tickle you indeed let vs go to some other place let vs sit in the sun vnder this wall sit away brother nathanael why see you not the great spider that hangs by a litle spider webbe o the great theefe he is a braue hunter for flies and butter flies haue you neuer seene the combat fought between the  spider and the buzzing flie no then you haue neuer seene the battaile fought betweene caesar and pompey why are they such braue vvarriours farre greater then the rat and the frog in aesops fables behold this cruell tyrant how many bees flies and butterflies he hath kild see their carkasses lye dead in his nets tis a straunge thing of the nature of this animal come tell vs something of him my fine pratling slaue tis a thing almost monstrous in nature of the nature of these spiders vnto whom woman and maydens are scholers and haue learned of them to spin and to weaue linnen cloth and the fishers also to make their nets but they haue a far greater grace and expedition in their industries the spinner the spiders wife and her daughter the yong spidreffe they spin and make thrids cobwebs for the toyle and the snare whilest her husband hunteth abroad some where for his and their liuing and is lurking secretly in some litle hole in the vvall to vvatch and to catch some beast to enrap him in his net and although his bodie be litle bigger then a peaze yet hath he for all that such spirit liuelinesse that sometime he taketh great buzzing flies litle lezards in his nets and marketh so well his time to chace that he seemeth to be an astrologian he is contrary to vs that tarry for faire weather for he chaceth when it is cloudie and darkesome vvhich presageth vnto vs raine according to the opinions of the two great philosophers aristotle and plinie hearest thou the frogs croke tis signe of faire vveather or of raine or of vvind or of storme or of nothing see you that dog there vvho pisseth against the vvall he is as plato saith in his second booke of his common wealth the most philosophicallest beast in the world but did you neuer see a dog meeting with a mary bone if you haue seene him you might note with vvhat deuotion he doth vvatch it with what care he keepeth it with what zeale he holdeth it with what pollicie he setteth his seete on it with what wisedome he tameth it with what affection he bruseth it and with what diligence he sucketh it what moueth him to do so what is the hope of his studie what good pretendeth he nothing more then a litle marrow true it is that this litle is more delicious then a great deale of all other things the reason why because that the marrow is a meate laboured to the perfection of nature as saith galenus lib fac c of all beastes there is none more sage nor more subtil then the lack anapes o the vilanous beast he doth nothing but mocke euerie bodie and sheweth his taile to euerie one that goeth by he keepeth not the house as the dog he draweth not the plough as the oxe he yeeldeth neither milke nor wooll as the sheepe he carrieth not his maister as the horse he beareth no burden as the asse that vvhich he doth is but to defile and marre all vvhich is the cause vvhy he receiueth of euerie one so manie blowes and mowes can you tell what my fellow companion maximilian told me what i pray thee that ieronimo pierruche is miserably inamoured of a prettie wench and that his brother  iacke he that plaied at nineholes vvith vs is bound with a marchant hauing quite left his learning that is he is promoted from the hall into the kitchin what is this i heare this ieronimo you knew him well fat slaue cherrie cheeked faire and vvell liking merry with a slicke face pleasant disposed and a tratling companion now he is leae vvan pale looking like one halfe dead vveake vgly dreaming louing to be alone and cares for no body company so that none of those that had seene him before could now know him againe o the poore and wretched yoong man of what proceeds his griefe of loue of loue tell troth now he is mad he is foolish oftentimes he vvalketh alone but vvill neuer speake to any bodie alwaies mumbling or recording some thing in english verse that he hath made to his sweete heart and minion o caitiffe boye one vvhile you shall see him faine a sea of teares a lake of miseries vvring his hands and vveep accuse the heauen curse the earth make an anatomie of his heart to freeze to burne to adore to plaie the idolater to admire to faine heauens to forge hels to counterfait sisyphus to play the tantalus to represent titius tragedie and by and by he exalteth in his verses that diana whom he loueth best her haire is nothing but goldwire her browes arches and vautes of ebenus her eies twinckling starres like castor and pollux her lookes lightnings her mouth corall her necke orient pearle her breath baulme amber and muske her throate of snow her necke milke white her dugs that she hath on her brest mountains or apples of alablaster all the rest of her body is but a prodigalitie treasure of heauen of nature that she had reserued to work the perfectio of his mistres dear tis great danger least he fall beside himselfe in the end o the poore passionate is cruelly eclipsed one while you shall see him drownd in teares and lamentations to make the aire eccho with his sighs complaints murmurings rages imprecations otherwhiles if he haue got but a glaunce of his goddesse you shall see him gay glistering like an emerawd and pleasant sometime you shall see him crosse passe and repasse fiue or six times a day through a street that he may haue but one friendly looke of her eye that he loueth best what will you giue me if i shew you a letter that he wrot to his sweet hart i pray thee my minion do me this fauour that i may see it i will read it out aloud hearken mistresse your beautie is so excellent so singular so celestiall that i beleeue nature hath bestowed it on you as a sampler to shew how much she can do when she will imploy her full

church is very long it is longer by fiue paces then our lady church at paris how can you tell i haue measured them both but this is not so large nor built so neatly and finely yet did englishman build them both let vs go walke below in the body of the church what ancient monument is this it is as some say of duke humfrie of glocester who is buried here they say that he hath commonly his lieftenant here in paules to know if there be any newes from fraunce or other strange countries tis true my friend and also he hath his steward who inuiteth the bringers of these newes to take the paines to dine with his grace keepeth he a magnificent house open house from fiue a clocke in the morning till six a clocke at night but for strangers i meane for strangers as well as for those of his owne houshold

knights of the post you are a skoffing companion in matters of greene apes faces harke if you stand in need of bale or suretie for fiue shillings these fellowes will lend you a false oath to bale you if it were ten thousand crownes you are a very iew go and you are an eater of serpents know you that fellow who walketh there cloathed in sattin he hath eaten his corne in the grasse he hath made then fine greene sauce see how he squareth it like an historiographer he is an alchymist by his mine and hath multiplied all to mooneshine he hath then blowne faire and liueth now as fish by the aire i monder much at one thing and it is that there are so many false coyners of money in england and so few alchymists alchymists i trust are not coyners no but sophisticators of mettals are false lads ile stand to it that chimistres are honest men i say neither good nor bad of them let them multiplie till their harts ake and their purses crake haue you neuer studied alchymistrie no for it is a pure vanitie o the sweet science o the rich deceit to make the folosophers stone how might one do to make it i will say to find it out you must bestow much blowing on all kind of mettals let me alone then

elixir the pouder of proiection the great vvorke and secret of the chymisters why is he prisoner then because he hath made gold purer by art then it vvas by nature tis great pittie truly but let vs prate a little more before vve go any further content see you that man there he is neither too little nor too big no for he is of an indifferent stature he is a fine man of his person and hath none other fault but that he is a theefe a drunkard a cogger a dicer a cutter if there vvere euer anie in london he hath his fingers made for the nonst as minerua or araohn and bath heretofore cried

can make her kind to i if she find fault i mend that fault and then she say i fault that i do mend it now good friend advise i how i may temper this strange spleen in she you be too amorous too obsequious and make she too assure she may command you when woman doubt most of their husband love they be most love husband must take heed they give no glut of kindness to their wife but use they like their horse who they feed not with a manger ful of meat together but half a peck at once and keep they so still with a appetite to that they give they he that desire to have a love wife must bridle all the show of that desire be kind not amorous nor betray kindness as if love wrought it but considerate duty offer no love rite but let wife still seek they for when they come unsought they seldom like they believe i macilente this be gospel o that a man be his own man so much to rule himself thus i will strive in faith to be more strange and careless yet i hope i have now take such a perfect course to make her kind to i and live content that i shall find my kindness well return and have no need to fight with my affection she late have find much fault with every room within my

in your term and all pray you leave we come gentleman adieu sweet lady ay ay let thy word ever sound in my ear and thy grace disperse contentment through all my sense o how happy be that lady above other lady that enjoy so absolute a gentleman to her servant a countess give he her hand to kiss ah foolish countess he be a man worthy if a woman may speak of a man worth to kiss the lip of a empress what be master fastidius go sister i brother he have a face like a cherubin god i what luck be this i have fetch my tailor and all which way go he sister can you tell not i in good faith and he have a body like a angel how long be it since he go why but even now do you not meet he and a tongue able to ravish any woman in the earth o for god sake i will please you for your pain but even now say you come good sir slid i have forget it too sister if anybody ask for my uncle sogliardo they shall have he at the herald office yonder by paul well i will not altogether despair i have hear of a citizen wife have be beloved of a courtier and why not i hey ho well i will into my private chamber lock the door to i and think over all his good part one after another well i doubt this last scene will endure some grievous torture how you fear it will be rack by some hard construction do not you no in good faith unless my eye can light i beyond sense i see no reason why this shall be more liable to the rack than the rest you will say perhaps the city will not take it well that the merchant be make here to dote so perfect upon his wife and she again to be so fastidious affect as she be you have utter my thought sir indeed why by that proportion the court may as well take offence at he we call the courtier and with much more pretext by how much the place transcend and go before in dignity and virtue but can you imagine that any noble or true spirit in the court who sinewy and altogether unaffected grace very worthy express he a courtier will make any exception at the open of such a empty trunk as this brisk be or think his own worth impeach by behold his motley inside no sir i do not no more assure you will any grave wise citizen or modest matron take the object of this folly in deliro and his wife but rather apply it as the foil to their own virtue for that be to affirm that a man write of nero shall mean all emperor or speak of machiavelli comprehend all statesman or in our sordido all farmer and so of the rest than which nothing can be utter more malicious and absurd indeed there be a sort of these narrow eyed decipherer i confess that will extort strange and abstruse meaning out of any subject be it never so conspicuous and innocent deliver but to such wherever they sit conceal let they know the author defy they and their writing table and hope no sound or safe judgement will infect itself with their contagious comment who indeed come here only to pervert and poison the sense of what they hear and for nought else stay what new mute be this that walk so suspicious

reckoned grace debt even david also describeth blessednesse man unto whom god imputeth righteousnesse without works saying blessed they whose iniquities forgiven whose sins covered commeth blessednesse then upon circumcision onely upon uncircumcisio also we say faith was reckoned abraham righteousnesse was then reckoned when he was circumcision uncircumcision circumcision uncircumcision he received signe circumcision seale righteousnesse faith he had yet being uncircumcised hee might father all them beleeve though they circumcised righteousnesse might bee imputed unto them also father circumcision them who circumcision onely also walke steps faith our father abraham he had being yet uncircumcised promise hee should heire world was abraham his seed through law through righteousnesse faith they law heires faith made void promise made none effect because law worketh wrath where no law there no transgression therefore faith might grace end promise might sure all seed onely law also faith abraham who father us all written have made thee father many nations before him whom hee beleeved even hee who quickeneth dead calleth those things bee though they were who

these three blessed fountaines sprange when saint pauls head leapt three times after was smitten off certaine saint denise tooke vp his head when was striken off carried his hands three miles breuiary saith his seruice these pope sure will infect drinkers heresie those epistles paul haue often done therefore these fountaines his holinesse stops vp lets them alwaies open good catholickes may resort

there need goe these holy places remission priests when they goe them doe giue them absolution part their wages say part seeing poore women doe pay rent his holinesse weekely good reason they haue some thing else raise their rents liue their trade let these goe good catholickes doe more wonder why honest godly matrons may enter into those places seeing paul tels vs christ there no difference betwixt male female no matter what saint paul saith must trouble conscience good catholicke hee must consider what church deliuers what pope teacheth must hee harken trust vnto trouble his head further scripture matters very dangerous howsoeuer dames rome maynot go yet credibly hoped our english catholicke ladies would leaue hereticall dunghill england come themselues holy city rome his
